		<emu_comment>Famicom game list by 83RL.[CR]The Family Disk System was released on February 21, 1986 by Nintendo as a peripheral for the Nintendo Family Computer console in Japan. It uses proprietary floppy disks (called "Disk Cards") for data storage. The Disk System's Disk Cards are somewhat proprietary 71 mm Ã— 76 mm (2.8x3 in) 56K-per-side double-sided floppy. These "Disk Cards," as they are officially called, were a slight modification of Mitsumi's "Quick Disk" 89 mm 2.8 in square disk format which is used in a handful of Japanese computers and various synthesizer keyboards, along with a few word processors. Some of the QuickDisk drives even made it into devices in Europe and North America, though they are somewhat rare. Mitsumi already had close relations with Nintendo, as it manufactured the Famicom and NES consoles, and possibly other Nintendo hardware.</emu_comment>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]'89 Dennou Kyuusei Uranai is a fortune-telling game, one that uses various Eastern-style horoscopes and other fortune-telling processes in order to predict the player's destiny for the year 1989 based on their date of birth. The game itself was released in December 1988. As well as the cart, players received an almanac that they could use with the game.[CR]Developers-for-hire Micronics were responsible for the game's framework, including the entirely inexplicable UFO cat creature seen on the box art and throughout the game.[CR]One odd instance is the game's "love test", in which the player can input two different dates of birth and the game will predict the couple's compatibility. If the player inputs two males (or two females) the game pretends to crash, shows a same-gendered couple embracing and then informs the player they made an "incorrect input".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]10-Yard Fight was originally released in arcades in Japan. Most people outside of Japan are most likely familiar with the Nintendo Entertainment System port; there was also an MSX port in Japan as well. New features were implemented such as the ability to to play both offense as well as defense. Another feature added was the 2 player versus mode where 2 players were able to duke it out against one another. The only problem with the 2 player mode is that the second player was given the A.I.'s powers such as in the single player game where you could run through the main defensive line without being tackled as well as getting by with a few interceptions. Most players adapted to the unfair advantage by compromising certain gameplay elements.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]When the player starts up the game and choose the single player mode, they can go against different levels of intensity. From easiest to hardest, the list follows from high school, college, professional, playoffs, and super bowl. The game time lasts for 30 minutes total with an accelerated clock. If the player won the game when the 30 minutes were up, they would proceed to the next level of intensity. Players could play both offense and defense in the NES version of the game but they could not choose plays for either. Instead on offense the quarterback can hike the ball whenever he feels like his pulling receiver is in a good location. After hiking the ball the QB can either run the ball himself, lateral to a different runner who can then either run the ball or throw it to a receiver, or can just throw the ball to the receiver. On the defensive side of things, the player is given the option to control one of two possible line backers who can either go to tackle the person with the ball or attempt an interception by getting in the thrown balls path. The ball is always punted on 4th down, or if the player is in range they will automatically set up for a field goal on 4th down.[CR]Arcade Technical Specs[CR]Hardware - Irem M-52 HardwareMain CPU - Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)Sound CPU - M6803 (@ 894.886 Khz)Sound Chips - 2x AY8910 (@ 894.886 Khz), (2x) MSM5205 (@ 384 Khz)Screen Orientation - HorizontalResolution - 256 x 240Refresh Rate - 57 HzPalette Colors- 528Players - 2Buttons - 2Joystick - 8 way[CR]</plot>

				<plot>After hundreds of years of chaos, mankind has finally emerged from the ruins of nuclear war. This world of the distant future has once again flourished under the guidance of the Great King, who harnessed the power of the 8 Eyes to rebuild the planet. These strange jewels of power were formed at the eyes, or center, of the eight nuclear explosionswhich nearly destroyed the Earth. In the wrong hands, the 8 Eyes could cause untold destruction... And now, they have been seized by the Great King's eight Dukes, in a desperate bid to gain control of the world for themselves. They have banished the King to the nuclear wastelands, and already their squabbling threatens to plunge the world into war once again! The task of retrieving the 8 Eyes falls to you, Orin the Falconer, the bravest and mightiest of the King's Guardsmen. With your fighting falcon, Cutrus, you must penetrate each of the 8 Dukes' castles. There you will face the Dukes' soldiers, and battle strange nuclear mutants such as living skeletons, giant wasps, and mud men. You must defeat the monstrous Boss of each castle to retrieve the Jewel of Power he guards. Then, to complete your quest, return the 8 Eyes to the Altar of Peace to await the return of the Great King, so that he may finish the rebuilding of Earth. Your reward will be the eternal gratitude of all mankind![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] House of Ruth Passwords[CR]While playing, pause the game and press Left or Right on controller 2 to scroll through the soundtest.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Maxed Passwords (Japan Release)[CR]These passwords are so named because they'll get you to the area designated with all hints and the final level.

				<plot>In the year 5012, a strange cytoplasmic creature is sighted in your galaxy. It's Parasitis! A deadly, formless mass which feeds on all life forms and assumes the shape of its swallowed prey! Parasitis rapidly advances upon your home planet, Abadox, and engulfs it![CR]From nearby space stations, the World Alive Force launches a full-scale attack. But the massive Parasitis crushes the entire squadron! An orbiting hospital ship is even swallowed whole - with the beautiful Princess Maria on board![CR]You are Second Lieutenant Nazal, the lone survivor of the Force. Sidelined from the action by your ship's faulty energy drive, you witness the attack! But it's not too late to join the battle![CR]Now your weapons are ready and your ship has been repaired! Jettison from your spacecraft, ignite your power pack and zoom into Parasitis' grisly surface. Your Mission: To blast your way inside Parasitis' nightmarish body and battle your way to its Core - to destroy it![CR]Fight your way inside its deadly mouth! Travel down its throat, through its nerve center - battling hordes of enemy antibodies and bacteria! Use lasers, guided missiles, and special orbiting shields to destroy them! Beware the Guardians that ward off all intruders - bombard them with fierce fire power! You must succeed to save the Universe and rescue Princess Maria![CR]--From the NES Abadox instruction manual.[CR][B]Overview:[/B]:[CR]Parasitis, a planet-swallowing monster, has swallowed a hospital ship with the princess of Abadox aboard. You are Lieutenant Nazal. Your job is to fly inside Parasitis, rescue Princess Maria, and destroy parasitis from the inside.[CR]Abadox is a side scrolling shooter where you're inside a giant alien. The game plays a lot like Life Force or Gradius in that it is a shooter with upgradeable weapons and speed. In Abadox, however, you are a spaceman rather than a man in a spaceship.[CR]The graphics in this game had a surprising amount of detail for an 8-bit system. The alien's organs and veins look pretty real. Sometimes they even move. There seems to be a repeat of the same background music for a good many of the levels. The sound effects were good, though.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]Fly Lt. Nazal through the alien to save Princess Maria. Be sure to get at least one speed power-up, or you won't be fast enough to move out of the way of enemies and their fire. Some people prefer two, but don't get three. You will be too fast and hard to control. Grabbing power-ups is essential, because they add to your firepower. With three-way and five-way shots, laser beams, and circle beams, there are a lot of options for weapons. They also have power-ups that will protect you from enemies. It will start circling you as soon as you get it, and give you an extra hitpoint. Other than that, you only have one hitpoint.[CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]A Button: Adjust the radius of your protective shields[CR]B Button: Fire weapon[CR]Start Button: Pause game[CR][B]Hints:[/B][CR]Invincibility[CR]At the title screen press: A, A, Up, B, B, Down, A, B, Start. When you start the game, press pause to become invincible. [CR]Reviewer: Adrian[CR]http://www.consoleclassix.com/nes/abadox.html[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] All Power-ups[CR]At the "Push Start" screen, press [B]Up, Down, Right, Right, Up, Left, Right, Down, Left, Up, Start[/B].[CR]Simply pause and unpause the game at any time to gain all power-ups.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Alternative Invincibility[CR]There is an alternative way to become invincible. Beat the game and let the credits end. You are taken back to the Title Screen. When you start your next game, you will be invincible until you Reset your NES.</plot>

				<plot>Based on the later parts of the Dragon Lance book Dragons of Autumn Twilight, the heroes are descending into a ruined city in search of the disks of Mishakal. Rumour has it that they are in a dragon's possession named Khisanth.[CR]This game is pretty hard to play at first. The controls are sluggish and hard to figure out. The game starts without giving you any storyline, and your party is already formed and in the middle of a dungeon. The graphics are pretty good, but the poor gameplay keeps this game from being a pleasant experience. It is worth a look if you are a fan of D&amp;D or just RPG's in general. Other than that, you prolly won't like it.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]The gameplay consists of horizontal fighting with a maze-like map using doors to change the view. The convoy consists of the eight Heroes of the Lance. You have to use one at a time, but you can change characters whenever you want by pressing Start and using the Hero Select tool.[CR]Simply press A on the guy you want to use, and put him in the frontman's spot. You can also use items, cast spells and equip weapons and armor from the menu.[CR]Each character has different types of attacks and spells, making them more suited to fighting different enemies, as well as acting as lives. When you do get into a fight, just tap A to attack. If your character has a bow and arrow, hold down and press A to fire. To keep your defenses up, equip the armor that makes your armor class lowest.[CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]A Button: Jump[CR]B Button: Attack[CR]Start Button: None[CR]Select Button: Menu[CR][B]Hints:[/B][CR]Order[CR]- The order your characters start off in is no good. Try this: Caramon, Sturm, Raistlin, Goldmoon, Riverwind, Tanis, Flint, and Tasslehoff.[CR]Reviewer: Adrian[CR]http://www.consoleclassix.com/nes/add_heroes_of_the_lance.html[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons - Hillsfar</title_clean>
				<plot>Run around completing random quests, and try not to fall off your horse too often. All the quests involve finding treasure or information of some kind from various locations throughout the game. Basically you just collect gold and healing potions, but you can't do anything with the gold anyway. Moving around the city to find clues to the next quest is very tedious, and moving from the city to other locations to pursue quest leads is ridiculously difficult. The only fighting in the game occurs at the arena, which you have to do if you're a fighter, if not you'll only end up there if caught by the guards while searching a building.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]I think I can safely say that Hillsfar is the Worst Role-Playing Game Ever Made. Actually I changed my mind, it's only safe to say that if you accept that this is an RPG in the first place, which it really isn't, despite the AD&amp;D title.[CR]There is absolutely no role playing involved. Your primary goal seems to consist of breaking into people's houses and stealing all their money without getting caught by the guards. Even when you are doing your job, following the missions given by your guild or whatever, you are always an outlaw. Your alignment doesn't matter. Your class doesn't matter. Clerics can't heal themselves, Magic-Users can't use magic, and Thieves are the only class that have any trouble stealing things, because everyone else can just break the lock, while a thief is supposed to use lock picks, which is nearly impossible and results in a bag full of broken tools rather than getting away with the loot.[CR]The first thing you're meant to do is wander around Hillsfar until you run into your guild. The guild master will tell you what he wants you to do next, and then you'll wander around the city looking for whatever he sent you out for. There are fifty thousand doors in Hillsfar, most of which have nothing to do with you, they're just a chance for you to get caught stealing. The doors that mean something at least have labels on them, but you'll wish the game would stop bothering you with all the ones just called 'door'. In any case, eventually you'll get to a point where no one is telling you what you should do next, in that case you just wander around breaking into places until you stumble on a clue for your next job.[CR]A lot of the quests require you to move between various locations nearby Hillsfar. You ride your horse and try to jump all the obstacles and duck the arrows and birds that try to knock you down. You can't possibly avoid all the obstacles, eventually your horse will run away because you keep crashing, then you get to walk to the trading post, getting mugged along the way, and hope you managed to keep enough gold to buy a new horse. Or at least a broken-down used one.[CR]Speaking of getting mugged, isn't this supposed to be a D&amp;D game? Don't you get at least a chance to fight off your attackers? Oh yeah, I had almost forgotten, this is NOT a role-playing game. You get caught by bandits. You get caught by the guards. You get caught by anyone or anything whose job it is to catch you, and there's nothing you can do about it.[CR]But at least you're on a grand quest, to accomplish great things and earn great rewards, right? No. All the quests are the same. Well, technically most of them are randomly generated, but they are identical in spirit. A maze of rooms with treasure chests on the floor. You have two seconds to decide you shouldn't have come in here before the guards are summoned. Then while the timer counts down you run around opening the chests, most of which are locked, so I hope you didn't play as a thief. About halfway through the timer countdown, you get a message that the exit can now be found, meaning that it magically appeared at some random location on the map. It also means that the guards have just entered the room.[CR]The guards are the stupidest things in the universe ever. They will try to stop you from getting to the treasure chests, and they can trap you in corners or small hallways, but even if they surround you, they won't do anything until the timer runs out. You just have to stand there and wait. You can't fight them, I may have already mentioned that. They take any treasure you may have just found, and either just kick you out, or send you to the arena.[CR]Thank goodness. The arena. Finally a place where you can fight something. A chance to use the D&amp;D rules in order to do something cool. Maybe I'll cast a Fireball. Maybe I can heal myself, he won't be expecting that. Maybe I can get behind him and stab him in the back for extra damage. Oh, no, wait, I did it again. This isn't a D&amp;D game. This isn't even a role-playing game. All I can do is swing this stick and hope it makes contact. This guy is gonna kill me, isn't he?[CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]A Button: Confirm Selections, Attack, Jump[CR]B Button: Cancel, Status Screen On/Off[CR]Start Button: Start Game[CR]Select Button: Menu Display[CR][B]Hints:[/B][CR]Stats[CR]- No matter what class you want to be, you want 18 Strength and 18 Dexterity for this game.

				<title_clean>Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons - Pool of Radiance</title_clean>
				<plot>This is one of the first games to incorporate the "golden box" game engine. This RPG is a good example of an excellent port from one medium to another. There were a PC and a C64 version, and the NES version featured original music, its own interface, and had different graphics. The graphics were good on the NES version. There was a nice amount of detail to the character's faces. This game allowed you to build your own party and characters, giving you total control.[CR]The story was very detailed and interesting. It was in a Forgotten Realms setting, and they almost always deliver. That, with open ended gameplay, made for a gaming experience much like real D&amp;D. The major difference being that you don't get to pick your feats and skills.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]Free Phlan from Tyranthraxus. There are several missions you can undertake that will earn rewards. Not all of them are mandatory. All you really have to do is clear the outer areas of Phlan so you can get to Valjevo Castle and fight Tyranthraxus.[CR]Be sure you have enough experience before you attempt to beat him, though. As with all RPGs, be sure to check everything and talk to everyone.[CR]Controlling your party is pretty close playing tabletop D&amp;D. You use the d-pad when not in combat, in a first-person view. To perform actions, just hit the A button to bring up the menu. From there you will be able to equip weapons and armor, make camp, use items, etc. Once you spot an enemy, you will have to decide whether or not to engage. If you do decide to fight, it will go into an overhead view of round-based combat. Each one of your characters will get their turn. On his/her turn you will be able to move and fight, or preform other actions that take the same amount of time. You can even delay your turn if you want. This will give your next turn sooner. D&amp;D rules apply, things like moving out of threatened areas will provoke attacks of opportunity. Remember to search your enemy's bodies after you defeat them.

It has also been released on the Wii's Virtual Console for 500 points. Because Adventures of Lolo is largely comprised of levels taken from earlier NES Eggerland games, which were Japan-only titles, Adventures of Lolo was never released in Japan; as a result, the sequel was titled Adventures of Lolo in Japan.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Lala, Lolo's pink friend, has been captured by the King Egger of Eggerland. Lolo must travel through five rooms in each of the ten levels in this castle to face off against the King Egger.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]LoloLolo[CR]The protagonist and star. Lolo works his way through dungeons full of puzzles to rescue his princess.

Snakey plays an important part of many puzzles throughout the Lolo franchise. Snakey can be used to block Medusas or Gols from shooting projectiles. Snakey can be used to stop other characters from reaching Lolo. Snakey can also be egged and ridden down rivers or be used to block character spawns. If Snakey is killed, and something is blocking his spawn, he will respawn elsewhere.GolGol[CR]Gol sits as a neutral character until all the heart framers in a level have been collected. After this, Gol becomes hostile and works very similarly to a Medusa. The only difference between Gol and Medusa at this point is that Medusa's projectiles can not be dodged, but Gol's fireballs are avoidable.LeeperLeeper[CR]An enemy that hops around and falls asleep when he touches Lolo. Leepers are mostly harmless enemies, but their main goal is to trap Lolo into an area that he'll be unable to escape. Leepers are incapable of crossing grass areas. Lolo can cleverly use Leeper's falling asleep ability to place him in front of other enemies, blocking them.SkullSkull[CR]Similarly to Gol, Skulls wake up after Lolo collects all of the heart framers in the level. Skulls do not move directly towards Lolo, but are rather like the ghosts in Pac-Man:  slowly making their way towards their prey. If they do manage to run into Lolo, he dies instantly.RockyRocky[CR]An enemy that, like Leeper, tries to trap Lolo; however, unlike Leeper, he will continue to chase the player if they evade his trap. If Lolo crosses his line of sight, he will charge in a straight line in that direction.AlmaAlma[CR]An enemy that chases Lolo. If he catches Lolo, Lolo dies instantly.MedusaMedusa[CR]An enemy that cannot move, but will instantly kill Lolo if Lolo crosses its path. His attack can be blocked by a rock, block, or another enemy. It looks like he is shooting a laser, though he is probably just petrifying Lolo.Don MedusaDon Medusa[CR]An enemy that is exactly like Medusa, except he moves. Don Medusa either moves from side to side or up and down. His knives can be blocked by rocks, blocks, or other enemies.King EggerKing Egger[CR]The main boss that captures Lala. King Egger only appears in cut scenes.[CR]Objects[CR]Heart FramersHeart Framers[CR]Heart Framers are scattered throughout the levels and it is Lolo's job to collect them. Once all the Heart Framers on a level have been collected, the Chest opens up. Heart Framers will occasionally contain shots. Lolo uses shots to turn enemies into eggs which he can push around to block things. Alternatively he can shoot the egg again to kill the enemy. In some levels, collecting a certain amount of Heart Framers will give Lolo a Power-Up.ChestsChest[CR]Chests open up when all the heart framers in the level are collected. At this point many of the enemies in the level will wake up and chase Lolo. Once Lolo collects the chest in the level, all the enemies will disappear and the exit door will open for Lolo to go through.Emerald FramerBlocks[CR]Emerald Framer are in most levels and are pushed around by Lolo to block Medusas or other enemies.One Way Pass[CR]These appear as arrows on the ground. Lolo can not move or push a block across the arrow opposite the direction the arrow is pointing.[CR]Power-Ups[CR]Power-Ups are obtained by collecting a certain amount of Heat Framers in a level. Not all levels contain Power-Ups.Hammer[CR]Allows Lolo to destroy a rock.Bridge[CR]Allows Lolo to create a bridge across water or lava.One Way Reverse[CR]Switches a One Way Pass so that it is pointing a different direction.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Skip[CR]This only works if you have a password that starts with A, B, C, or D and if the second letter in the password appears earlier in the alphabet than the fourth letter. If so, switch the second and fourth letters in the password. Use the new password to start at a level one higher than the original.</plot>

				<title_clean>After Burner</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]After Burner, is an arcade flight sim/shooter, developed by SEGA and first released in 1987 in Japanese Arcades. It was designed by legendary Sega game developer Yu Suzuki. It was ported onto many systems, including Sega's own Sega Master System just a few months after the Arcade launch, but most of them weren't able to match the original Arcade version's visceral speed and graphical/sound quality.[CR]It is the first game among a series of franchise sequels such as After Burner II, After Burner III and the 2006 release of After Burner Climax which ran on the then newly developed SEGA Lindbergh arcade hardware. After Burner II was re-released in 2004 for the Playstation 2, in the SEGA AGES 2500 series of budget anniversary re-releases.After Burner Arcade Machine[CR]In After Burner the player controls a F-14 Tomcat, a type of jet, and the object of the game is simply to shoot down other enemy jets while evading their return fire with deft maneuvers. The player-controlled Tomcat is equipped with a machine gun and a small number of missiles as a secondary weapon which replenishes after each completed stage.[CR]The original After Burner machine is a rarity, exclusively available in the Japanese Arcades. It was controlled with a simulating flight stick, with buttons that controlled the cannon and missile weapons. Movement such as dropping/gaining altitude and barrelrolling was also perfomed by movements with the flight stick.[CR]The arcade version also featured a deluxe cabinet, which rotated according to the player's movements (much like Space Harrier and Galaxy Force). This was featured in the arcade scene of the 1991 hit movie Terminator 2: Judgement Day, where it was being played by a teenage John Connor.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Background Test (US Version)[CR]Hold Left + B on Controller 1 and A on Controller 2 at the same time before the title screen appears (at the console power up/reset sequence or after the game over screen). Press Left or Right on Controller 1 to change the menu options. Press Up or Down to select the menu option. Press and hold Select to hide the menu.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Harder mode.[CR]Once you've beat the game, press any button to continue to the Main Menu again. Now, when you start playing again, you'll be in a harder mode. The game won't tell you this, but you can see by harder enemies in the first stages who you'd normally come across only in later stages.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Music Test[CR]Before you turn on the game, press and hold down the b button, then turn on the game. You'll be able to listen to 5 songs.</plot>

Basically, the game is a fortune teller/horoscope simulation. There is no challenge in the game: the only thing you have to do is to provide information about yourself (like when you were born, in which place you grew up, etc.). Then you enter the current date. After this, you can access a large menu, where you can learn various things about yourself by talking to Ai Sensei. Those things include general horoscope, your destiny depending on the planets, your future love life, etc. The explanations can be quite detailed and are often accompanied by pictures, which vary depending on the character you have created.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]Hold A, B, and Select, then reset the console to reach a sound test.</plot>

				<title_clean>Air Fortress</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Air Fortress is a shoot-em-up and platformer hybrid developed by HAL Laboratory and first released in Japan for the Famicom in 1987, and later for the NES in 1989. The game was designed by Hiroaki Suga. The music in the game was composed by Hideki Kanazashi under the alias 'Escaper Kanazashi'.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Shoot-em-Up Gameplay[CR]Air Fortress contains two different forms of gameplay that repeats over each of the eight levels.Shoot-em-Up[CR]Upon entering each air fortress, the gameplay is a side-scrolling shooter with basic enemies and two different kinds of power-ups: Energy and Crash beams (represented by a bubble with either an E or B inside, respectively). Each energy bubble provides 100 extra energy points, while the crash beam bubble will provide 5 more shots of the crash beam. These power-ups are intended for use once inside the fortress proper. The player has three attempts to enter an air lock which is located at the end of each level. The ship will automatically lock on to this. Once locked on, the air lock allows the player to go inside the fortress.PlatformerPlatformer Gameplay[CR]At this point the gameplay changes to the feel of an action adventure game, almost like a miniature Metroid style game. The player has two weapons at their disposal: A regular gun and a more powerful shot, the crash beam. The regular gun is unlimited, however the number of crash beam shots are based upon how many that were collected during the shoot-em-up section, though more are available to collect in this mode.[CR]There is no jumping in the traditional sense, but the player can activate their rocket pack to move around vertically. Any movements and shooting made inside the fortress take away energy, though resting will regenerate the energy up to its maximum level. However, getting hit by an enemy will bring the total energy amount down, which will not recover with rest. At the end of each fortress is an energy core which must be destroyed. Once it is gone, there is a limited amount of time to find a vehicle and escape.[CR]Air Fortress contained a password system to allow players to continue from where they left off.[CR]After completing the game there is a second quest available with the same level layouts, but with more difficult enemies.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The following is taken verbatim from the opening text before starting the game:[CR]The inhabitants of the planet Farmel have lived in peace since the establishment of the stardate calendar. They have traveled all around the galaxy with a new style spacecraft called the lightship. Then one day the peace was disturbed by a mysterious big fortress. it was living and destroying all the other civilizations. The federation of intergalactic power organized the defense forces immediately.[CR]The federation forces were no match for the superior defenses of the air fortress. The fortreses totally destroyed all of the federation forces. The federation decided to select a specially trained person ID82592 named Hal Bailman. Hal's equipment includes a newly developed light blaster and armored suit.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Airwolf, based on the 1980s TV show about a high-tech military helicopter during the Cold War, is a first-person simulator that occasionally switches to a third-person side-view when collecting prisoners in order to make it easier to land the Airwolf. These sequences require some gentle descending from the player, such as with other gravity-based side-scrollers like Thrust and Lunar Lander.[CR]Airwolf is the first NES game developed by Beam Software, a prolific Australian computer game developer at the time which is now known as Krome Studios Melbourne. As such, it often feels like a computer game compared to the usual quick and simple cash-in games based on licenses that were being released by Acclaim and LJN for the NES at the time.[CR]There was a prior Airwolf game for the NES, released in Japan only, which also had the name Airwolf. It was developed by Kyugo Boueki and should not be confused for this version.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Pause Game[CR]During gameplay, press Select and Start simultaneously to pause the game.</plot>

				<plot>The game is based on the anim movie of the same name. The year is 2019, 31 years after World War III. The events of the game (and of the movie) take place in a futuristic city called New Tokyo, which is controlled by corrupted military and rival gangs. You control Kaneda, the leader of one of such guys, and the main character in the movie. Kaneda's childhood friend, Tetsuo, is injured during the highway chase, and taken by the military. While trying to free your friend, you find out a strange power is growing inside him...[CR]The game is a traditional Japanese adventure. Instead of a menu with set commands, you have different options on each screen. After watching a cutscene or scrolling through a dialogue, you have several options to choose from. In many situations, some options will lead to Kaneda's death or imprisonment, which is Game Over. There are no real puzzles or anything of the sort, but if you choose the "examine" option which is available on most screens, you can move the cursor around the screen and choose what exactly you want to examine.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Akuma-kun: Makai no Wana ("Akuma-kun: Trap of the devil") is a roleplaying game developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Tose and published by Bandai on February 24th, 1990 in Japan. Based on a popular 1989 anime TV series (which in itself was based on a Manga series) Akuma-Kun, the game puts players in control of Akuma-kun as he travels the world visiting towns and dungeons on his way to make connection with the demon world.[CR]Although very similar to most roleplaying games of the time in terms of gameplay, this switch in narrative from the usual tropes of having to kill demons rather than befriending them, helped to set the game apart from others. Furthermore, battles would play into this idea by allowing players to spawn demons to fight alongside them, similar to the Megaten series.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Final Stage Password[CR]At the password screen, press Right 10 times, Down 1 time and enter the Japanese character.

				<title_clean>Akumajou Dracula</title_clean>
				<plot>"Strangers in the night, exchanging grievous bodily harm . . ."[CR]As black clouds slither across the moon overhead, our hero straps on his tight leather outfit and swaggers towards the rusty gates before him. Just ahead lies an ancient castle, its ruined spires consumed by the darkness; before this night is through, he's going to subject its occupant to the crack of his whip and a violent end upon his hard wooden stake.[CR]But don't be afraid, this nocturnal miscreant is merely Simon Belmondo, lash-toting vampire hunter for hire, and he's setting off to fulfill his ancestral charge. You know the one: ridding the land of the dread Count Dracula and his legions of undying horrors dredged up from beyond the peace of the grave.[CR]That's right, this is a Castlevania game![CR]In fact, it's the very same "Castlevania" that we all know and many love on the NES  save for few key differences, the most important of which will probably make you groan like one of its tortured shades. Accompanied by a radically different MSX2 adventure (a review for another day), this celebrated vampire-stalking franchise began right here with one of the best games developed for the ill-conceived Famicom Disk System. Fortunately AKUMAJOU DRACULA, like so many of that platform's gems  most notably the first two Zeldas and Metroid  was subsequently thrown onto the cartridge format, where it quickly proceeded to both delight and frustrate gamers throughout the rest of the world. Considering the popularity of the above titles, it's a good thing those honorable Japanese businessmen separated the wheat from the chaff, eh?[CR]Whichever version you choose to play, Simon's journey will take us through six challenging levels cloaked in a feeling of pervading gloom. True, today its visuals are threadbare even by 8-bit standards, but they're nonetheless suitably creepy with settings like the stone crypts that soon give way to a laboratory filled with ominous machinery, chained skeletons and piles of skulls. Particularly notable were the simple yet haunting melodies that struck a chord with us all for years to come as we slowly ascended desolate towers of reddish brick and deadly spike traps, or traipsed across the moonlit ramparts alongside ravens who perched atop the broken statues before giving flight and attempting to peck our hero's eyes out. Who can forget listening to the seminal tune "Vampire Killer" as one tread beneath the tattered red curtains and moldering walls of the first stage, whipping down groups of ghouls clad in ragged shrouds, and avoiding the panthers who would suddenly spring to their feet and lunge after us?[CR]Simon may not have a face, but he certainly has an atmospheric environment to blindly stumble about in.[CR]There's no shortage of eldritch creatures for him to slay while he's there, like the horrifying guardian of that first level  you'll fearfully stare into the baleful eyes of a hellish denizen spawned from deep within the foulest pits of the Abyss! Well . . . actually, it's a giant bat. [CR]But they get better! Besides the Count, you'll fend off many of the classic staples of monsterography: the lanky Frankenstein, a pair of tightly-wrapped mummies, and of course our good friend, the scythe-wielding Grim Reaper. It even established a good number of staples of its own, be they the carnivorous mermen that shoot up from the murky waters deep below the castle or the deadly gears of the clock tower high above. And while you won't run into any peasant mobs brandishing torches, you will encounter plenty of flickering candles.[CR]Ah yes, the candles. In a fine example of Nintendo logic at work, these tallow sources of illumination that litter the walls in each and every hallway, occasionally suspended in midair, actually dispense the little red hearts that flutter down to feed your lethal arsenal. As you're no doubt aware, Simon can grab one of a small complement of sub-weapons that are frequently useful in various situations, armaments ranging from the axe that swings upward in a wide arc, to the fragile vials of holy water he lobs downwards to scorch the ground. Knowing when to take a new weapon you come across and when to keep what you already have often holds a noticeable influence over your success, as many bosses suffer from a profound weakness against a specific combination.[CR]There's also much to be found secreted away if you're thorough  not merely treasure bags, crowns, and moai heads worth major points (and thus, extra lives), but also Double Shots and life-replenishing meat hidden in the walls or the nondescript blocks underneath your boots, just waiting to be savaged open by your probing whip.[CR]You'll definitely need such things, as this game quite deservedly founded the series' early reputation for offering a potent challenge. Unfortunately, most of Akumajou Dracula's difficulty actually stems from its draconian controls. Simon can only whip something that's directly in front of him, and the attack first requires a few seconds for him to wind up before the enemy will finally taste its punishing sting. Moreover, this enemy will merely shrug off your repeated assaults until it finally bursts into flame; if you get hit, however, our hero will tumble three feet back with a muffled "oof," often careening backwards into a nearby bottomless pit that some sinister programmer thoughtfully placed there for your convenience. Speaking of which, any attempt to descend stairs adjacent to a ledge that's made without holding "down" on the crosspad will result in Simon plummeting to his doom; try a mighty leap up onto a staircase and he'll sail right through it.[CR]The most famous pratfall, however, is the fact that you can't control the direction of a jump once you've dared to hit the button, making it rather unwieldy to avoid moving objects and often sending you straight into the rotting arms of a hitherto unseen danger as the screen scrolls forward.[CR]Couple that with the enemies Dracula throws your way and you've got the makings of a throbbing headache. Medusa heads that wildly swoop across your path to knock you off a ledge or interfere with your struggles against the projectiles of axe-hurling knights, bone dragons that violently snake up and down while spitting fireballs, and bleached skeletons flinging their femurs all over the screen with reckless abandon . . . all of these follow definite patterns and probably wouldn't be all that tough under normal circumstances, but they're unusually treacherous thanks to Simon's cumbersome ineptitude. That's not solely the fault of the controls, either; in the later areas, he can only withstand a few hits before expiring. With only six levels, Akumajou is a pretty short game  but it doesn't much feel that way considering the patience it takes to master them.[CR]This is pretty significant, as one of the complaints I frequently hear levied against the domestic Castlevania (as well as spiritual sibling Ninja Gaiden) targets its lack of a password system. I certainly would have appreciated one myself way back then; instead most of us simply became very, very good at repeating the levels over and over again until we could trounce them in our sleep. The rest simply went insane, never realizing[CR]THE HORRIBLE TRUTH:[CR]Boot up this disk and you'll immediately notice a nice little name registration screen nestled within a border of tiny little skulls, each with a stake poking out of its bleeding eye socket. How cute, it looks just a grislier adaptation of the one you see in our battery-backed Zelda games. But wait . . . that would mean . . . yes, the Famicom Disk version allows you to SAVE YOUR GAME. You heard me, Simon's first outing was actually designed to let you pick up from whatever level you last met your demise in whenever you wanted to, but Konami removed the idea completely when they brought it over! Interestingly, Japan didn't get their own cartridge version of Akumajou Dracula until over half a decade later in 1993. That copy doesn't have a save feature either  it has an EASY MODE.[CR]But despite its faults, this is still a strong game, if a typically overrated one. Today the first Castlevania may find itself hopelessly overshadowed by nearly all of its descendants; later installments added stunning gothic visuals, increasingly focused on multiple characters and divergent exploration to complement the traditional action, and steadily chipped away at the original's difficulty until they actually became too easy. Their great granddaddy nevertheless stands out as one of the creepiest games to be found anywhere on the Famicom and retains both the evocative music and the classic gameplay elements that are still the series' trademarks. It's not the masterpiece that some might claim it to be, but neither is it a mere footnote for greater things to come. It's simply a game that, warts and all, is still pretty fun to play, plain and simple.[CR]Reviewer's Score: 7/10, Originally Posted: 07/15/04[CR]Reviewer: Tachibana Ukyo[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/fds/review/R76152.html[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Play Without Music[CR]At the title screen, let the demo play twice and press Start once you see the title screen for the 3rd time.</plot>

("Demon Castle Special: I'm Kid Dracula!") is a Konami Famicom game and a spin-off of their famous Castlevania (or Akumajou Dracula) series. The player is Kid Dracula, a.k.a. Alucard, and must confront the time-travelling demon lord Galamoth after the latter challenges him to a fight. The game is far more lighthearted with its cartoonish visuals and was intended for younger audiences.[CR]The game was never released outside of Japan, and remains one of the few Castlevania games to never see an English localization. Its 1993 Game Boy sequel/remake, Kid Dracula, was released in both Europe and the US however.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]American Dream is the third gamling sim game from Coconuts Japan (a Japanese game publisher that also produces slot and pachinko machines) to feature their character Pachio-kun. Pachio-kun is a sentient pachinko ball who is compelled to find other pachinko balls, though he occasionally frequents pachi-slot machines (or just plain slot machines in this case). Pachio-kun takes a convenient helicopter ride from Tokyo to New York to earn lots of money from their casinos.[CR]The player's goal is to access each district of New York (in order: Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Manhattan and finally over state lines to New Jersey) via the rainbow bridges that separate each district, and these bridges all require hefty tolls that Pachio-kun must raise at the casino. In addition, the game has a few adventure game elements, tasking Pachio-kun with finding objects to proceed with the game: the first such object is a pass to get into the casinos. The vast majority of the gameplay are the slot machines, however.[CR]Despite the American theme, this game never left Japan. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Earn Money Faster[CR]At the password screen, go to the last row of the password field (5th row) and enter COCONUTS. Now you'll find money more often and win more easily at gambling.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ankoku Shinwa: Yamato Takeru Densetsu ("Dark Myth: The Legend of Takeru Yamato") is an adventure game based on a manga of the same name by Daijiro Morohoshi, who wrote a lot of sci-fi and historical mangas with dark Lovecraftian themes. He is credited in the game's opening credits.[CR]The story of the game is that a distant descendant or reincarnation of Takeru Yamato - the legendary prince of the Yamato people that assassinated the leader of the supposedly barbaric Kumaso clan - is looking into the death of his father and discovers a plot by some still-existing Kumaso to resurrect their dark gods.[CR]As well as exploring each area, searching for clues and talking to NPCs using a menu-driven interface - as is the case with many adventure games for the system - the player will occasionally fight a boss in a side-view action mode.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Become Genghis Khan and lead the most fearsome army in the known world. Use your Land of Mongols to build an empire on the bodies of your enemies and the rubble of their conquered cities. With skill, cunning, diplomacy and luck, all of Europe and Asia could be yours. Failure means shame in the eyes of your princess, or even death! Victory on the battlefield requires bold strategy and clever planning. Outmaneuver your opponent with cavalry, lay siege to his castle with archers or even challenge him to a duel. But success also requires brilliant political tactics and a sharp eye for business during times of peace. Genghis Khan is based on actual history and offers a blend of strategy and role playing elements. Make history as you play the great Khan himself or his rivals, Richard the Lionhearted, Emperor Alexious III, or Shogun Minamoto of Japan.</plot>

				<plot>Arctic is an action puzzle game that describes itself as "active rail playing". Each of more than two-dozen stages consists of a set of rails in various arrangements, often looping around each other and splitting in various directions. Each stage contains a number of colored balls which begin in corresponding slots, and after launching them the goal is to return the balls to the matching-colored slots. The only interaction the player has with the board is switching two sets of splits; there are yellow and blue splits, which will redirect any balls moving through them, and the player can only turn all of one color as a group. Many stages also contain bumpers and gates which will affect the speed and direction of the balls. Completing a puzzle often requires strategic use of the stage's features to bounce balls onto the correct paths.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]At the startup screen simply press 'Select' to be able to listen to all tracks featured in the game. Press 'A' to switch to the next tune.</plot>

				<plot>[CR]Note: This page refers to the Nintendo Entertainment System version of Rygar, which was an open-world action-adventure game, not the linear arcade release and its many ports which can be found here.[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rygar is an open-world action-adventure game where the player assumes the role of a "Legendary Warrior" who battles through a hostile landscape. The main form of attack is a spinning shield on a chain called the "diskarmor," which is tossed out like a yo-yo. The game is primarily set from a side-scrolling perspective, but there are also some occasional top-down sections.[CR]The game is based on an arcade game of the same name, but the original version of the game is a straightforward action game, with none of the story or freedom allowed by this NES release.[CR]Over time, Rygar (known simply as the Legendary Warrior in Japanese versions of the game) collects additional items that open up access to different parts of the game, with the end goal being a final confrontation with the evil Ligar, who lives in a sky castle high above the land of Argool.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]"4.5 billion years have passed since Earth's creation. Many dominators have ruled in all their glory, but time was their greatest enemy and it defeated their reign. And now a new dominator's reign begins..."From the opening of the arcade game[CR]While this is very abstract, the manuals for the console releases reveal that the evil being Ligar has taken over the land of Argool, and that Rygar, a dead warrior who has risen from his grave, must use his Diskarmor along with a variety of other weapons to stop him. In console versions, clues and limited dialogue are given in the form of large, sage-like men encountered in stone green temples throughout the game. In the Japanese original, references to "Ligar" and "Rygar" are one and the same, due to the fact that the Roman syllables "Li" and "Ry" come from the same Japanese character. As such, the hero is only referred to as "The Legendary Warrior", while both "Rygar" and "Ligar" refer to the main villain.[CR]The Japanese version of this game contains different music than its English localizations.[CR]Despite existing as a counterpart to an existing arcade game, this NES version of Rygar was released back into arcades on Nintendo's PlayChoice-10 hardware in 1987.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Argus is a shoot-em-up game made for the Arcade and eventually ported to NES. Argus was published by Jaleco Ltd. and developed by NMK Co. Ltd. in 1986. The game supports one or two players.[CR]Argus is functionally similar to Xevious: The screen scrolls vertically and the player has separate buttons for ground (bomb) and air (gun) attacks. Shooting at three structures on the ground with the same letter will give the player a power-up and it's also possible to temporarily transform into a powerful robot variant. The game also introduces an odd feature where the player is expected to land their ship at the end of each stage: This requires some precise control and timing with the D-pad, otherwise the ship will crash and explode.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Invincible[CR]At title screen press and hold Select on the 2nd controller and then press Start on the 1st controller.</plot>

				<plot>The original Breakout concept involves controlling a bat at the bottom of the screen and using it to catch and direct a ball so as to hit all the bricks which are arranged at the top of the screen. It was unpopular for over a decade, before Taito revived it with some new ideas in this arcade game.[CR]The game's plot redefines the bat as a Vaus spaceship, the ball as an energy bolt, and the bricks form a mysterious wall stopping the ship from progressing to safety.[CR]By the mid-80s, power-ups were popular in most types of arcade games, and Arkanoid features them. They are caught by positioning the bat below them as they fall (meaning that you risk missing the ball if you go for them at the wrong time). The power-ups include lasers (which are mounted to each side of the ship and allow you to shoot out the blocks), a catching device (so as to be able to fire the ball off at a different angle every time you hit it) and one that slows the ball.... sorry, bolt.... down. Needless to say, the game inspired tonnes of clones, few of which added anything else.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue code[CR]To continue on the same level after you run out of lives, wait until the ''Game over'' screen goes away. Then, on the title screen, HOLD DOWN A+B while pressing SELECT 5 times. Let go of A+B, and press start. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Skipping[CR]At the title screen, if you wait long enough, you will enter an AI demo - the demos go from Levels 14, 15, 23, 30, and 5, in that order. During this demo, the AI controls almost everything. However, in the third demo (Level 23), you can press the A Button at times to influence things like the ball's launching. When launched, the AI tries to keep the paddle under the ball. Normally, this succeeds since you can't control the paddle; however, if you activate the laser, the paddle shrinks slightly. If you time this correctly, the ball will bypass the paddle and therefore a life is lost. If you then use the continue cheat (Select five times while holding A and B), you'll go to the level the AI lost a life on! Just keep in mind that the game will show Level 23 as Level 1, Level 24 as Level 2, and so on.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Armadillo is a platformer game developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System by FortyFive (at the time, AIM) and published by Information Global Service on August 9th, 1991 in Japan. It is a fairly straight forward platformer in which you play an Billy the Shell, a cowboy who seeks to rescue his love, Sheryl from an evil organization who has since kidnapped her.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game follows most platformer conventions, with the exception of having to roll up into a ball in order to kill enemies and make it past tougher platforming sections. Once in his ball form, Billy takes on completely different physics that allow crossing and reaching greater distances possible, but also make the character harder to control.[CR]Another noticeable different is that progress in the game is gated by running into bosses on the world map as opposed to the linearity of most platforming games where each level must be completed in succession. If the player engages and defeats the boss, the next world is unlocked.[CR]Sequel and other versions[CR]A North American port to this game, plus a potential sequel for the GameBoy named Armadillo Gaiden were announced by Information Global Services, but never came to pass. The GameBoy sequel instead got re-branded as Ultraman Ball.[CR]A popular unlicensed SuperVision hack of the game also exists, known as Rock'n Mario IV, which has Armadillo's sprites edited to look like a Super Mario game.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Long time ago, an advanced civilization existed in the Solar System. But one day, a black hole appeared nearby. Many people were sucked into it an transported into another dimension, which they named Artelius. It was ruled by the evil king Sarbelor, who constructed a machine named Galax, which tore the dimension into lonely asteroid-filled spaces accessed by warp points. The peace-loving scientist Dr. Rado built you, a cyborg who can travel through space, and entrusted you with the mission of finding and destroying Sarbelor.[CR]This game is an action RPG. You navigate the hero in top-down view through space; chains of asteroids represent inaccessible areas on the map. You travel between various space areas by approaching warp points. The enemies randomly appear on the screen around you. When you contact an enemy, a battle begins. Battles are viewed from first person perspective; you are in control of a cross-hair, which you must move around the screen and press the fire button when you place it over the enemy. There are also special attacks at your disposal, which require weapon points (WP). Winning the battles gives you experience points, allowing you to gain levels ("classes") and become stronger.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Selection[CR]From title screen, head into the "Continue" menu. There, press the following sequence of buttons - B, Right, Start, Right, Right, Select, Right, Left, Right, Right, Right, Left, Select, Left, Right, Select. A two-digit number will appear in the lower-right corner. Use the A Button to cycle through the numbers, which scrolls from 00 to 1A - these represent the levels from Level 1 (00) to Level 26 (19) in hexadecimal code. The final option, 1A, will simply restart the game as normal, but without background music. To activate whichever option or level you want, once it is represented in the bottom-right, press the B Button and then load a file.</plot>

				<title_clean>Asmik-kun Land</title_clean>
				<plot>Asmik is not only a name of a game-developing company, but, as we learn from this game, also a cute little pink dragon. Recently, monsters began to invade the peaceful country of the dragons. The only way to stop this invasion is to contact the six Dragon Gods. Unfortunately, those gods seem to be asleep. So now Asmik must travel all over the world to find six magical splitters, that will help him to awaken the dragons and to defeat the monsters.[CR]This is a traditional action platform game. Asmik can jump and exhale steam from his nostrils to turn all his enemies into eggs. Those eggs can be eaten and later used for various purposes (during boss battles, acquiring upgrades at a shop that becomes available once you have completed a stage, etc.). Asmik dies if he comes into close contact with an enemy. Boss battles differ from the rest of the game, each one being a mini-game of its own, for example a rock-paper-scissors game during which Asmik uses his correct choices to gain time to proceed to the next stage.</plot>

				<title_clean>Astro Robo Sasa</title_clean>
				<plot>This is a shooting game with a twist. You are in control of a small character who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or (which is sometimes easier, but with dire consequences to the later stages) destroy them. If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. [CR]The twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously. Preserving the precious energy points and trying to propel yourself exactly to the obstacles which you must destroy on your way to the energy packs is the only way to successfully complete the game.</plot>

				<title_clean>Atlantis no Nazo</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]Atlantis no Nazo (translated to The Mystery of Atlantis) is an action-adventure platformer developed and published by       SunSoft for the      Famicom (only in Japan) on April 17, 1986. The player assumes the role of Wynn, a boy adventurer who sets out through the mystical land of   Atlantis (risen from the ocean depths) to rescue his missing master. The game is known for its non-linear progression through 101 "zones" (including many hidden warps only accessible through non-sensical means, such as throwing dynamite into hidden spaces, falling into certain pits, or commiting suicide by dynamite in a certain area). Atlantis no Nazo is also known for its intense difficulty, mainly from the player character's hard-to-control jumping and falling physics. A prototype cartridge of Atlantis no Nazo for the Nintendo Entertainment System was unraveled decades later, revealing that the game was to be officially translated and released outside of Japan on 1989 by     Activision as Super Pitfall II (the sequel to the unrelated    Super Pitfall). Other than minor translations, it would make major changes to some infamous zones (such as the "BLACK HOLE!" zone warping to zone 29 when the player has one life remaining, and the "secret final zone" giving the player every power-up). Despite the translated game not being released, the original game became a cult classic after its appearance in the Japanese television series  GameCenter CX (known in the United States as Retro Game Master).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Infinite lives[CR]At the title screen, press A on controller 2 11 times, then press B on controller 1 22 times, and hit start.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Alternate Final Zone[CR]In Zone 20, you'll see 3 big Moai statues standing next to each other and the message "KEYWORD NAGOYA" on the screen. In Japanese NA means 7, GO means 5 and YA means 8. So throw dynamite 7 times on top of the left statue, 5 times on top of the middle statue and 8 times on top of the right statue. If done right, you'll be warped to an alternative final zone.</plot>

				<plot>Attack Animal School is more than a little inspired by Sega's popular Space Harrier, but with a cuter setting. As in its role model, you fly towards the screen or run on the ground, rendered in a checkered 3D field. The hero has been replaced with a uniform-clad schoolgirl, who must shoot down enemies which come flying, jumping or crawling towards her. The enemies are no longer spaceships, asteroids or dragons. Instead, they are various cute and furry animals, such as kangaroos, cacti with sweatbands, turtles and flies. The end-of-level dragons are also decidedly cuter, with the first level boss being a fluffy koala. Attack Animal Gakuen is one of few Famicom games to support the 3D glasses (like Space Harrier 3D for the Master System), though it is perfectly playable without glasses.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Select[CR]At the title screen hold Left + Down and press B on controller 2 several times. You'll see the lives counter increasing, this tells you what level you will start in. Now, after deciding on the level, on controller 1 hold the A button and press Start. If done right, you'll start on the desired level.</plot>

				<title_clean>B-Wings</title_clean>
				<plot>B-Wings is based on the popular arcade game Battle Wings. It is a vertically scrolling space shooter that owes its name to the space fighter from  Star Wars movies. You have a wide variety of weapons at your disposal: Fire, Cannons, Jump, Hammer, etc. Each weapon has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, Cannon fires powerful and rapid blasts, but you can only shoot directly in front of you; Van covers several directions, but has slow speed; Anti builds a protective shield around you each time you shoot, but its range is very small, and so on. You can change the weapons every time you are killed, before you run out of lives and lose the game. Typically, at the end of a level you'll have to face a boss enemy.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Stage &amp; weapons Select[CR]At the title screen, first press and hold Up and then hold A; then release Up and then A.

				<title_clean>Babel no Tou</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Babel no Tou ("Tower of Babel") is a puzzle/platformer from Namco in which the main character has to lift and place various L-shaped blocks in order to proceed to the exit. There are a total of 64 stages and each is progressively more difficult. Exacerbating the issue is the player character's intolerance for getting crushed, roaming enemies and a limit based on how much power the player has remaining, which drops each time the player character lifts a block. The player character can also collect items that occasionally appear in the world, but these usually confer point bonuses and nothing more. Should the player manage to successfully complete a stage, they will be given an extra life to help with the next one.[CR]Every eighth stage is a "reprieve room", where there are very few blocks and the exit is easy to reach. However, the player needs to figure out the special technique to make a symbol appear, as these are instrumental for completing the game once the 64th floor has been reached. These generally involve tricks like holding a direction down on the D-pad for a length of time.[CR]Babel no Tou would be eventually repurposed for the Arcades with a "Vs. Babel no Tou" version. It is also available on two Japan-only Namco compilations: Namco Gallery Vol. 3 for the Game Boy and Namco Anthology Vol. 1 for the PS1.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Final Floor Passcode[CR]After solving Pro Level 64, you have to choose an 8-object passcode of 8 characters to win the game.

Imitation of the Four Heavenly Kings Star") is a virtual-life simulation game developed and published for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Pack-In Video on September 14th, 1990 in Japan. Similar to many other life simulation games of the time, this title allowed up to four players to compete in a virtual board-game akin to the Bakushou!! Jinsei Gekijou series and features humorous storylines, mini-games and random events. The focus of this particular release is to become a "star", either as a musician or an impersonation entertainer.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] See The Results[CR]Note that this code requires a specially-modified Famicom controller that allows you press Left and Right at the same time. When the letter dice is rolling during a turn, press both Left and Right to slow down the dice, allowing you to more easily "choose" your desired value.</plot>

Jinsei Gekijou series developed by Taito, this game follows many of the genre's tropes from chance rolls dictating life events, to gathering money and physical traits that benefit the player's life. Unlike the Jinsei Gekijou series however, Ai no Gekijou opts to focus on teenage life and romance in particular, rather than the wider scope seen in other life-simulation titles.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In the year 3037, the most competitive sport in the known universe is Ballblazer. For the first time ever, humans from the planet Earth have won the right to compete in the final round of the Ballblazer Championship, to fight for Earth's honor and the title Masterblazer![CR]Ballblazer is a 3D futuristic soccer-like game, where the player (inside a Rotofoil) is set on a one-on-one 1,155 square playing field (the Grid). The objective of the player to kick a floating ball (Plasmorb) inside the opponent's goal (Goalbeams). A player may compete against a human or computer opponent.[CR]The Rotofoil is equipped with a multi-purpose forcefield. This forcefield when in short distance of the Plasmorb will act as a pull field, automatically pulling the Plasmorb towards to player. When a player in possession of the Plasmorb shoots, the forcefield will act as push field and launches the ball. When the match starts, the player must move down field and attempt to gain possession of the Plasmorb using the joystick and blast the Plasmorb to an intended direction. [CR]The player should also be aware that the Goldbeams move slightly every second and the distance between them will shrink. The highest scoring goals are goals made when Goldbeams have disappeared across the horizon (Over The Horizon/OTH shots). A player may also attempt to steal possession of a Plasmorb by rushing beside the opponent and blast the Plasmorb away. The game ends when time runs out or a player wins 10 consecutive goals. If the game ends in a draw, over-time will apply and the first player to score will win the game.[CR][B]Scoring:[/B][CR]Close-in goals - 1 point[CR]Goals near Goldbeams - 2 points[CR]OTH shots - 3 points[CR]Players may steal points from each other by making goals. [CR]The total combined score of both players cannot accede more than 10 points.[CR]A player winning 10 consecutive points automatically wins the game.</plot>

				<title_clean>Balloon Fight</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Title Screen[CR]Balloon Fight was developed and published by Nintendo. First released in arcades in 1984, the NES version was released in 1985. Unusually for a Nintendo developed property post the launch of the NES/Famicom, Balloon Fight was also ported to Japanese home computers the NEC PC88-01 and the Sharp X1.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] consists of either one player or two-player co-op mode, and the goal of the main game is to defeat all enemies on screen to clear each level. The player is given three lives at the beginning of each game. There is also a Balloon Trip mode that tasks a player's reflexes by presenting an obstacle course full of hazards.[CR]The game was later added to the Wii Virtual Console, the Wii U Virtual Console and the 3DS eShop. It is also present in the first NES Remix from indieszero as one of the featured games.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The Main Game Mode[CR]The player character is a person with two balloons strapped to their back. The player must hit either the A or B buttons to flap the character's hands to fly about the stage, attacking enemies by landing on their backs and popping their balloons. Enemies are defeated by popping both of their balloons, and then landing on them while they are on the ground (in order to prevent them from inflating another balloon). There is also a body of water in the center of each level. If an enemy or player falls into the water or floats too close to the water, a large fish jumps from the water and eats the character. A spinning bumper-blade appears in the later levels as an added obstacle.[CR]Between every three normal levels, a bonus stage occurs. In the bonus stage, the player attempts to burst a large number of balloons as they float up from the bottom of the screen. If all 20 balloons are collected, a large bonus is added to the player's score. Following each bonus stage, the player is also rewarded with a full complement of two balloons.Balloon Trip[CR]The game also features a single-player mode called "Balloon Trip" where the player moves across a side-scrolling level, avoiding lightning bolts and gathering balloons. The player only has one life in this mode, and there is no ground to land on. Players begin the trip at a rank of 50 and as more balloons are gathered, their rank decreases. Nothing special happens if the player stays alive long enough to reach rank 1 (the game simply continues on indefinitely). In the closing part of Iwata Asks about Tekken 3D for 3DS, former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata, who was the programmer of Balloon Fight, stated that they made the Balloon Trip mode in the last 3 days of development.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]One Of The Later Stages[CR]Balloon Fight was one of the first NES games ever released, several months after the launch of the US version of the console.[CR]The entirety of Balloon Fight was included in the 2002 title Animal Crossing where the game cartridge was featured as a hidden title. Once a player found said cartridge they could play the game any time they wanted to within the game. In 2007, Balloon Fight was released for the Wii Virtual Console. The franchise also saw a spiritual successor in the form of Tingle's Balloon Fight DS, a rare Japanese Club Nintendo exclusive DS cartridge released in 2007. Balloon Fight also serves as the theme to the "touch" mode in Tetris DS.[CR]On January 23 2013, one day after the 28th anniversary of its release on Famicom, Balloon Fight was announced to be the first Virtual Console game released for Wii U. It was released that day worldwide as part of a special promotion celebrating 30 years of Famicom, before even the Virtual Console service proper was released.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B]  [CR]The game "Banana" takes place in a world called Banana Land, which is populated by anthropomorphic moles. Mr. Mole is on a picnic with his wife and son when an earthquake strikes, trapping his wife and son underground! Help Mr. Mole rescue his wife (and sometimes son) and find their way to the exit through underground areas of varying design. The game features 105 stages and a custom stage design mode. [CR]   Characters[CR]Mr. Mole: Our protagonist. He's an expert digger who loves bananas. [CR]    [CR] Kiko: Mr. Mole's wife, who apparently can't dig herself out despite her mole heritage. She must be rescued in each stage before the player can advance to the exit.[CR]    [CR] Nabi: Mr. Mole and Kiko's son. He has the same digging issues as his mother. He appears in some stages as a second target to be rescued.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The object of each stage is to make it to the exit after picking up all the various food items and Mr. Mole's family members. There is no way to "die" as such, but the player can make a mistake and make a stage impossible to complete; for this reason the player can "give up" by pressing the A and B buttons simultaneously to re-try the stage. Mr. Mole can only dig left, right, and down; he cannot dig straight up. Moving upwards can only be accomplished via ladders. Mr. Mole cannot dig through boulders; in addition, boulders fall down when ground is dug out beneath them, so players need to be mindful not to trap themselves. The player is awarded bonus points for completing a stage in as few steps as possible, so try to find the most efficient way through! Later in the game Mr. Mole can find bananas which allow him to use items to help him solve puzzles; these can include bombs, ladders, and ropes. In addition, some later stages can be multi-screen; the player can scan the area before attempting to make any moves. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 8 Lives, 255 of all items, Prevent Life Loss, and Play the Demo Stage[CR]At the title screen, opt to go to Level 101 and start a new game. Kill yourself twice (A+B, Player 1) and reset the console. Repeat this, but kill yourself three times, and don't reset the console; just press a button to return to the title screen. If done properly, the menu text is now pink. If you hold A and B on Player 2's controller at the title screen and start a new game, you will start with 8 lives, 255 ladders, 255 ropes, 255 stones, and 255 bombs. Additionally, if committing suicide, hold A or B on Player 2's controller to prevent life loss. Note that you cannot get high scores using this. Additionally, you cannot see the ending normally. (At Stage 105's completion screen, hold Up on Player 2's controller.) Finally, you can also play the demo stage by holding A and B on Player 1's and Player 2's controllers before the demon starts, but at the title screen.</plot>

				<title_clean>Bard's Tale II, The - The Destiny Knight</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]   Taking place following the events of the first   Bard's Tale, the party that is presumably the same that had saved the city of Skara Brae receives a desperate letter from a mage called Saradon who implores them to come to his aid. An evil and powerful archmage named Lagoth Zanta and his hordes threaten the cities of the Realm and it is his hope that the player's party will be able to stop him. But the only relic that could unite the cities and give the party the power to stop his invasion has been shattered. The fabled Destiny Wand that has maintained seven centuries of peace is gone and with it, the hopes of an entire land. However, Saradon has managed to discover where the pieces of the wand lay hidden. Broken into seven pieces and hidden within seven deadly Snares of Death throughout the land, the party is challenged to reforge the Destiny Wand, call upon the powers of the Destiny Knight, and ultimately confront and destroy Lagoth Zanta. The players begin their quest in Tangramayne, the capital city of the Realm, a land where six other cities lay scattered across a large, open wilderness. From there, they must gather the clues needed to unravel the locations of several other dungeons, each containing a vital clue to lead the party on to their next destination. There are no cinematics within the game to help tell the story, although there are occasionally small events in the form of text that help describe some of the key elements within the game. The Snares of Death, in particular, had "magic mouths" which would present their challenges in the form of riddles filled with the clues needed to survive each one. The hint guide, bearing the title "Dream Quest", for the game was particularly noteworthy for its narrative approach in guiding the player. Taking on the form of a fictional story centered around a party of adventurers that sought the services of an old wizard and his young apprentice, they would embark on a "vision quest" into the possibilities offered to them of a quest for a certain "golden fleece" or that of the Destiny Wand. The young apprentice would invisibly accompany the party into the vision and the journal that he would carry would magically write itself with their experiences and his own thoughts creating the story journal. The hint guide was illustrated with artistic sketches alongside maps and would describe the ending of the game as well as that of its own story.[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]   Players must assemble a band of adventurers and track down the seven pieces of the Destiny Wand to confront and defeat the evil Archmage, Lagoth Zanta. Once all seven pieces are recovered, the scepter must be reforged, unifying the Realm and winning the game.[CR]The Destiny Knight is the sequel to the first Bard's Tale as initially released on personal computers such as the Apple and the Commodore 64. According to the box text, it features various improvements over the original system such as:50% larger than the first Bard's Tale Six new cities and an overland wilderness The ability to summon and name monsters to become a permanent part of your party Ranged combat A bank and a casino  Six cities expanded the scope of the adventure acting more as locations for specific dungeons than as living, breathing, politically driven entities. They are:Tangramayne Ephesus Philippi Colosse Corinth Thessalonica  The game continues to use the   grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90&#176; turns and movement spaces. Within the persistent interface, a small window on the upper left quadrant of the screen displayed the world as in the first with the party listed below and a text box in the upper right quadrant of the screen displaying messages and encounter options. Random enemy encounters would provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes which would now use ranged attacks.Destiny Knight was also notable for its use of an open wilderness between the six cities of the Realm, the land in which the story takes place. Predating similar efforts such as that found in Bethesda's   Elder Scrolls series by several years, the wilderness contained several dungeon areas that were necessary to complete for the main quest.   Puzzles were also given a high priority this time around in the form of Death Snares, trap rooms in which the pieces of the Destiny Wand were hidden and which could kill the entire party if they failed to solve it within a certain time limit. A rough map was included with the game showing the locations for several places but leaving the mapping of each interior to the graph paper tablets RPGers at the time used often to keep from getting lost.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]   Beginners were given a break in the form of a pre-made party that they can use to jump right into the game with. The adventure starts at the Adventurer's Guild, a location in each city where the player can save the game, form their party, and save their characters to disk just in case the worst happens. Across from the initial Guild is a starter dungeon which should get them up to speed on both the game systems as well as toughen their characters up for the trials ahead. The manual suggests that the characters should reach level 14 before venturing anywhere else in the game.As with most RPGs of this type, party setup and character selection were left entirely up to the player. A party is limited to seven characters, although the manual suggests leaving one slot open for summoned monsters or special encounters that may occasionally join the party. This was particularly important within one of the dungeons of the game as a particular NPC would be required to help solve a puzzle.Time also plays a factor in the game as it cycles from day to night, night bringing out the more dangerous creatures that roam the Wilderness.Veterans can transfer character data from the first   Bard's Tale,   Wizardry I, or   Ultima III if they want to start off with a solid group of characters, although items and the like are not brought over.The game did not make use of an outside license for its statistics and rules, although it shared many similarities with TSR's Dungeons and Dragons ruleset with significant differences that set it apart. In particular, mages were not required to maintain a memorized "pool" of spells as in D&amp;D and instead cast their spells by using spell points which represented their inner strength and power. The types of spells that any one mage could cast were also dramatically different, although a character's   general statistics would reflect some of the traditional mentality that TSR's influence over RPGs at the time had made an impression with. RacesSeven races are available for players to choose from and is the first step in creating a new character and a party of seven adventurers with which to go out and save the world.  Human: As in most RPGs, their statistics and abilities are fairly average across the board with no distinctive bonuses. Elf: Fair haired, fair skinned, and more agile than humans, their specialities are focused on both magic and war although they tend to do better as spellcasters.   Dwarf: Short, gruff, and strong if not very smart, dwarves excel as solid warriors in the Bard's Tale.   Hobbit: Small, nimble, and wise, they make ideal rogues. Half-Elf: Thanks to their mixed ancestry, they are able performers as fighters although not as good as spellcasting as their elven peers. Half-Orc: Part human, all ugly, they also make decent fighters but offer no other significant bonus other than variety to the party.   Gnome: Resemble dwarves but are better at using magic. If you are looking for a little toughness to go with your mages, this is one race to consider.   Classes   Picking a class for a new character is one of the important decisions that the player will make in a game like this one. Using a combination of different skills is the key to building a solid party that will be able to return home and sing of their adventures. On the party screen, characters are represented by their name and abbreviated class for quick reference along with all of the requisite attributes such as   hit points (HIT PTS) and  Spell Points (SPL PTS) in  columns and lines.Warrior (WA): The consummate fighter, they can use nearly every weapon that they find. For every four levels of experience after the first, they gain the ability to dish out an extra attack. Paladin (PA): These are fighters dedicated to smiting evil wherever it may be. They can perform multiple attacks at higher levels, use most any weapon including certain ones that other fighters can't, and have a greater resistance to evil magic. Unlike in other systems, such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the player does not have to pick a deity for them to worship nor can they cast any spells of their own at higher levels. They are a pure fighter with bonuses making them a staple of any party in the Bard's Tale.  Rogue (RO): The professional thieves of the Realm, what they lack in fighting ability they make up for being sneaky. They can hide in shadows (thus avoiding damage from enemies) and are able to search for and disarm traps of which there are many especially within the Death Snares. Bard (BA): They are warriors that have learned to sing. Although they don't have multiple attacks at higher levels as a true warrior class would, their songs are capable of spell-like effects that can aid the party in a variety of ways. Unlike spell casters, the Bard's songs bestow important buffs on the entire party for the duration of the song. Their songs can often work even within anti-magic zones. If combat interrupts a song, it will pick up again when it is completed even if another song is performed during the fight. An instrument is needed for a Bard in addition to whatever weapons they have. The Bard can play as many tunes in his repertoire until his throat dries, thus necessitating a visit to the local tavern for a tankard of fine ale to get them going again. Hunter (HU): They can use most weapons and have the ability to often instantly kill an opponent by striking a vital nerve center, an ability that improves as they gain experience levels. Monk (MO): They use traditional fighting weapons and gain more effectiveness at fighting with their bare hands at higher levels becoming devastating warriors.   Magic users were divided into several classes with a few of these requiring a pre-requisite in ability. Mages had to meet those requirements before graduating to the higher classes which are initially unavailable to a starting party. It was also a one-way class change. Once a character chose to be a particular class, they were locked into that decision and could not learn any spells that they chose not to.Conjurers (CO): One of the first classes that a magic user can start with. They can create fireballs and compasses to help defend and guide the party and have a smattering of healing spells for support. Magicians (MA): This is another class that new magic users can start off with. They can enchant items with temporary effects and user their spells as buffs to aid the party in combat, such as improving their armor class. Sorcerors (SO): They can create illusions including illusory party members and aid in the perception of the world around the party with spells enabling them to see in the dark. Most of their offensive spells tend to be mind based. These are not initially available to new characters until they have earned three levels of experience as either a Conjurer or a Magician. In other words, if a Magician character class has leveled far enough to cast third level spells, they can become a Sorceror. Wizard (WI): As with the Sorceror, a mage must learn at least three spell levels of their starting class before they can become a Wizard. Wizards are the summoning specialists and have the ability to raise the dead making them extremely valuable. Archmage (AR): This class can only be attained after learning three spell levels from each of the preceding classes, although the manual suggests that a true Archmage is one that has learned all seven from each. Archmages have the smallest number of spells to choose from, but make up for this thanks to the sheer power vested within each one. They are able to heal an entire party, resurrect multiple characters at once, crush enemies with incredible magic, and summon powerful allies. Lagoth Zanta, the main antagonist of the game, is an Archmage.   Locations   There are a variety of locales in the game that provide a number of important services, listed both in the manual and within the game itself:The Sage: He lives out in the Wilderness and is a valuable treasure trove of knowledge. The player must make use of his services in order to ask for the location of certain places to which he will point the way, but only for a price. As the player journeys through the world, they will encounter new clues that they must barter with the Sage on in order to continue the quest, entering certain key words into the parser that comes up when conversing with him. Temples: Provide valuable healing services for when your mages aren't powerful enough yet to do the healing themselves. They are also the only places tha can cure withered characters (old age) or ones that have been turned to stone. The manual says that the resurrected character may need to sell their soul in order to come back to life, but in terms of the game, that doesn't happen. Roscoe's Energy Emporium: Roscoe is a mage who had opened a chain of energy emporiums in order to cash in on the sorcereal energy crisis of '27. Even after it had passed, Roscoe's emporiums continue to provide a valuable service by recharging the spell points of wealthy mages. His services don't come cheap, but if you can't wait for spell points to regenerate, his emporiums are worth a visit. Unmarked Buildings: While exploring the cities of the Realm, the player can barge into unmarked buildings. This also tends to trigger a combat encounter. For the most part, there is nothing to see in any of these structures except the exit, although the party will be running into several of these in searching for hidden dungeon entrances leading to the next part of their quest. Adventurer's Guild: This is the "union hall" where unemployed characters hang around hoping to join the next expedition. This is where it all begins and one is located in each of the major cities. Saves are handled here along with party formation. You can't save while in the middle of a dungeon or out in the wilderness, so knowing where these are located in each city is an important part of the game. You can also remove characters from your party and keep them here in case you need to free up an extra slot for a special character. One or two puzzles require the use of a special character in the party. Garth's Equipment Shoppe: Garth retired from adventuring and his deeds are sung far and wide. He now sells his knowledge of weapons and artifacts as a part of a string of stores that lie spread across the Realm, providing basic equipment to everyone as well as a few particularly rare and powerful pieces for those with enough gold. He can also identify unknown items thanks to his extensive knowledge, for a price, Selling rare items to Garth will not appear in his shoppe, though, so be careful about getting rid of items that you might need later on. Fortunately, quest items cannot be sold. Garth is everywhere and in every shoppe, so you don't need to worry about trekking back to one particular branch. Review Board: Shadowy figures representing all of the classes in the game sit in judgement over characters that come to them for advancement. If you have enough experience, you'll get your level. Mages learn their spells in batches, so once they gain a spell level, all spells in that tier are learned. These are not marked on any map and must be discovered. The good news is that they typically have a unique facade so turning and facing a building is all that is needed to know what it is. Casinos: Players can gamble their ill gotten gold in these halls for the chance to score big, although the dealers have been known to cheat if stiffed for a tip. Bedder's Bank for the Bold: An old-half elf who had reputedly sold his own mother to a band of lonely orcs to finance his first branch, Bedder will deposit your gold for safekeeping in case anything...tragic...happens to the party. There's no interest and withdrawals must be made for the entire amount, but gold can be added at any time in any amount. Good for making sure that there's a nest egg out there available for any set of characters that you might create.  Taverns: The rest stop for the Bard in your party and a place to hear pieces of gossip.  There were also the seven major dungeons that could only be found with the help of the Sage scattered throughout the Realm. Each dungeon would consist of several levels and sometimes possessed a   boss fight or two in addition to the Death Snare within. They would take the form of tombs, crypts, castles, and even a tower. [CR]Combat[CR]   Fighting in the game is handled through random encounters and is required to earn those valuable   experience points and grow the party into an unstoppable force capable of facing the dangers ahead. A list of foes (broken down by the number in each group) is given at the start of the fight. The maximum number of foes is up to four groups of monsters. Any group of monsters within 10' (feet) of your party are within melee range. Some monsters, however, will also use ranged attacks such as breath weapons or spells to deal damage, or summon monsters to block your advance. Combat is divided into a series of rounds and it is up to the player to decide what they should do next.Party arrangement is also important. The first four characters can be physically attacked and can dish out the same leaving the last three to resort to ranged attacks.Combat actions are triggered by hitting the appropriate key when a character's turn comes up, allowing the player to time certain attacks for when it is a particular character's turn to act in that round. They are:(A)ttack foes: Orders a character to physically assault the enemy. This applies to the first four chraacters only. (P)arty attack: Orders a character to beat down a fellow party member or special character. Sometimes necessary. (D)efend: This reduces the damage a character may recieve in case you suspect that they can do nothing else at the moment. (U)se an Item: Allows a character to use a ranged weapon or a magic item. (B)ard Song: Tells the Bard to play a short tune during the fight. Typically lasts for only one round. (C)ast a Spell: This is where mages get to work their magic. When selected, the player must enter the four digit code for the spell in question and specify a target if required. (H)ide in Shadows: Tells a rogue to hide in the shadows, avoiding damage during that turn since the enemy can't see them. They can also avoid spell effects this way.  All of the results are calculated in the background. Certain statistics, such as dexterity and luck, determine who will strike first in a fight. The character in the first party slot is designated as the leader and the chance of running into danger is heavily determined by the statistics of that leader.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Name Passwords[CR]Enter one of these names (using the Japanese syllables named) to achieve the named effects.</plot>

Each spell cast lowers this number. Spell points will recharge over time, and the player can visit Roscoe to replenish more quickly.Experience Points - A measure of the character's accomplishments and knowledge.

The temple priests can return lost hit points, cure diseases and ailments, and raise the dead.Taverns - Scattered throughout the city, taverns are places of respite for weary adventurers. Here the player can catch up on the local gossip, down a pint to return a lost voice, and find all manner of the unexpected.Unmarked Buildings - The city is filled with run-of-the-mill buildings of no particular use. Many of these have been inhabited by Mangar's dark followers and are a prime location for battle for beginning adventurers.

While only the first two groups are within melee range, other groups can still attack at range, and even advance between rounds. Defeated enemies will leave behind chests containing gold and experience, as well booby traps periodically.Wine Cellar - Rumor has it that the wine cellars below a local tavern hold more than dusty wine bottles, and that the followers of Mangar roam the corridors in even greater numbers than the city streets.Sewers - Even darker creatures are rumored to inhabit the sewers under the wine cellar, from poisonous spiders to half-breed creatures to strange monks dressed in green.Only the heartiest party should adventure to these depths.Catacombs - Beneath one of the local temples, the moans of undead hordes can be heard from the ancient catacombs. Followers of Mangar the Dark and the mad god await in the depths.Harkyn's CastleKylearan's TowerMangar's Lair[CR]Magic[CR]The four character code needed to cast is given after the spell name.

The Black Widow's bite is poisonousPoisoned (POIS) - Causes a character's health to decrease over time. This can be particularly dangerous in battle, since a poisoned character's hit points will drop after every round. Poison can be cured with the Flesh Restore spell, and is a hazard of fighting Black Widows and Spinners.Possessed (POSS)StoneWithered (OLD) - The player character has been withered to old age, reducing all attributes to 1. Withering comes primarily from the Wither Strike spell cast by Magicians, but also from the touch of Wights and Demons.[CR]Monsters[CR]A compendium of monsters is being compiled in the  Creatures image gallery. Most are virtually the same apart from their image, but the following are notable.Barbarians are a dreaded foe early in the gameBarbarians - Encountered at the beginning of the game they often come in large groups. They are tougher than the average monster and can be very treacherous for a beginning party.Magicians - They have the same spells as hero Magicians and often cast Wither Strike on party members, aging them prematurely. Best to take them out as early as possible. Magicians are encountered from the beginning of the game, but particularly in the wine cellar and sewers, where they like to cast from the back ranks.Black Widows &amp; Spinners- A successful hit will poison the target. This can be cured at the temple, which is very expensive, or with the Flesh Restore spell. These are encountered beginning in the sewers.Sorcerers - An early enemy with a group attack, they will often cast Warstrike, damaging the entire party. Sorcerers are first encountered in the lower sewers.Wights &amp; Demons - Nasty foes that have a withering touch. Wights are found starting in the sewers, and demons are summoned by Wizards in the castle. Dragons are formidable foesWraith - A single touch from this foe will turn its victim insane. Found primarily in the castle, but also found occasionally in hidden corners of the catacombs.Dopplegangers - They can attack the party from even the back reaches of the battle. Found in the lower catacombs and castle.Dragons - Feared foes whose breath engulfs all ranks of the party in combat. Found in the lower reaches of the catacombs and the castle.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]When creating a party, remember that only the first three party members (not including the special member) are in melee range. The last three should have skills that do not require physical attack, such as a bard or spellcasters.While in the city, the player can still summon a stone elemental for aid in combat (using the "z" key).New characters are created with money, but no equipment. The player can create some new members and take their gold.If the player leaves the Adventurer's Guild and does not return (from exiting the game, for example) all of the party's gold will be lost in the corresponding last Adventurer's Guild  save. This can be avoided by manually backing up and restoring the character files (*.TBW). This can be useful early in the game, when gold is hard to accumulate and death is more frequent. Note that this only works if the files are backed up or restored while the game is not running.The state of the world does not persist from session to session, or even when changing dungeon levels.Bards can only play one song per experience level before needing a drink.Before changing casters to Sorcerers, consider switching them to the other starting class (Conjurers to Magicians, Magicians to Conjurers). Not only will they retain the spells of their old class and gain the spells of their new class, but the experience point requirements per level are the same as if they were beginning characters, so advancing through the spell levels will be much faster -- and they gain the extra spell points and hit points!Be careful when using illusionary monsters. Some enemies will not believe them and the illusion will disappear.[CR]Additional Information[CR]The original full title of the game is Tales of the Unknown, Volume I: The Bard's Tale. This was planned to be the first in a trilogy of Tales of the Unknown, each for a different class with the first being the bard. But the game was so successful and the name became so iconic they renamed the series as The Bard's Tale.The Archmage Ybarra referenced in the game was named after  Joe Ybarra, one of the game's developers and co-founder of  Electronic Arts.Characters from both  Wizardy and  Ultima III can be imported into the game.[CR]Compatability[CR]Bard's Tale can still be played on modern PC operating systems like Microsoft Windows Vista and XP with emulators like  DOSBox.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Baseball, from Nintendo's in-house R&amp;D1 studio, is a rudimentary version of the sport of the same name that Nintendo created for the NES and the Game Boy. The game was a launch title for both respective systems in the US, first on the NES in 1985 (the Japanese Famicom version was released in late 1983, a few months after the system's debut) and subsequently on the Game Boy in 1989 (it was also a launch title in Japan).[CR]It is notable for being one of the first Game Boy games to be configured for use with the Game Link Cable, which allowed for multiplayer gameplay between two Game Boy units.[CR]Game Boy[CR]Game Boy Box Art[CR]The Game Boy version of "Baseball" was one of the first games available for Nintendo's handheld. It includes Mario and Luigi as captains. Mario himself is featured on the cover.[CR]Mario and Luigi are captains of the team; Mario is the captain of the Bears; Luigi is the captain of the Eagles. The player can select them as their pitcher if they wanted, but graphically all the pitchers look the same. The rest of the team pitchers have common English names, such as "Paul","Randy","Sam", and "Jimmy."[CR]During this era, Nintendo would often include Mario in games just for appearances' sake to help sell the game, though often it wasn't really possible to control Mario in many of these games. Other examples of this is Mario is the ref in Tennis and the paddle in Alleyway.[CR]Baseball-e[CR]Nintendo re-released the NES version of baseball for their short lived GBA e-reader attachment. The game came in a pack much like a pack of baseball cards. There were a total of 5 cards that had to be scanned by the e-reader in the correct order. On the back of each card provided screenshots of the game as well as tips and instructions.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Player, manager, owner... You can do it all in Baseball Stars! Make your own teams and leagues; hire, fire, and trade players; develop your players from inexperienced rookies into veteran pitchers and hitters. Play against a friend or challenge the computer - you'll never have to worry about being rained out again![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Regular All Womens Team (not powered up)[CR]Select Create Team and then press down, down, down, down, down, right, right, right, right, right, right, right. Select "power hitters" and then change "WHAT IS A WREN?", into "A BIRD." Remember to punctuate the answer.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Getting 6 power-up points[CR]When you buy a power-up for a player, the game randomly assigns 1 to 6 points for you to spend on your player's stats. Baseball Stars constantly auto-saves: if you bought a power-up, got 1 measily point and spent it, you can't reset and load the old save. However, if you reset BEFORE spending the points, you'll still have your money, so you can just reset as soon as you buy the power-up (and find out how many points you got) and try to get 6 points everytime. This saves you a lot of money, especially since the cost of power-ups grows exponantially. [CR]This might damage the cart's battery save, so you probably shouldn't do it unless you're using an emulator (Note: don't bother using emulator savestates for the same effect, you'll keep getting the same amount of points)</plot>

				<plot>As you blast your way through the next millenium, you'll be fighting for your life. Aerial bombs, machine guns, and flying warriors will be on the attack. But that's just for starters. You'll be piloting the next generation of pursuit craft, including a super-charged racer, aqua blaster water craft and turbo copter. Assuming you can manuever through twists and turns at maximum turbo force, you'll need to blast a menacing Boss at the end of each stage. To survive you better have reflexes, guts and a sixth sense to avoid disaster. With the speed and G-force-inflicting action of a super chase into worlds you've never imagined, Super Spy Hunter is light years beyond the original. And with multi-dimensional graphics and sound effects that bombard your senses, it'll take everything you've got. Super Spy Hunter. It's a manhunt at the speed of light.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]Normally, you have infinite continues in this game. If - for whatever reason - you wish to limit them, first start up the game.

The game offers semi-destructible environments - the brick walls that make up most of the levels can be destroyed completely allowing you to cut a path to your target. Other non-destructible obstacles such as water (cannot be crossed) and foliage (hiding both your and enemy tanks from view) make up the rest of the environment.This game can be played 2-player, co-operatively.Enemies come in waves, and can range from enemy tanks that can be destroyed in one shot to armoured behemoths that take more than several shots to destroy. The game has no boss battles. The player can completes a level by destroying all 20 enemy tanks on the level or loses the level if they run out of lives, or if an eagle statue (i.e. your base) at the bottom of the map is destroyed by the enemy.To help defeat the enemy, several temporary powerups can be picked up after destroying foes. These range from invincibility for your tank, invincibility for your statue to extra lives.Finally, the game also offers a level creator. However any levels created cannot be saved.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret Message[CR]On title screen, select the "Construction" option and press Start to enter it and Start again to return to title screen.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]As the video game market slowly turned towards the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis, Rare Ltd released this game which can be considered one of the best looking games on the NES. The game begins aboard the space ship &#8216;The Vulture&#8217; where Battletoads Rash, Zitz, and Pimple (all disgustingly named after skin diseases) are escorting Princess Angelica back to her home planet. Pimple and Princess Angelica go cruisin&#8217; and get intercepted by the game&#8217;s villain, the Dark Queen of Ragnarok. Both are kidnapped and taken back to Ragnarok. The Professor (captain of The Vulture) takes Rash and Zitz to &#8216;rumble&#8217; with the Dark Queen on Ragnarok and &#8216;get the Princess and Pimple back.&#8217; The remainder of the game takes place on planet Ragnarok where Rash and Zitz set off to save their friend Pimple and Princess Angelica.Gameplay[CR]While the first level is a typical 2d beat em up similar to Double Dragon, other levels have a variety of gameplay styles, including rappelling down a pit, riding speed bikes and surfboards, navigating a level on a unicycle-like vehicle that can ride up walls and on the ceiling, etc. The main objective of each level is to defeat as many enemies and overcome as many obstacles as possible and reach the endpoint. General strategy is to memorize these obstacles[CR]and rely on quick reflexes to reach the end. The entire game rounds up to two difficult levels where you climb a tower and, at the end, reach the Dark Queen.[CR]The most memorable aspect of this game is the absurd difficulty. Not only did it employ a decent amount of memorization but reflexes had to be fast, even for veteran gamers. Another memorable moment for this game would be the humorous way enemies were finished off, be it by using a football helmet or sprouting horns and ramming the enemy off screen.[CR]When the game was released on the Game Boy Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded it the scores of 8,8,8,7 saying, "...one of the best Game Boy games I've ever played". The Game Boy version had the same basic theme found in the NES adventure, with the toads using all of the same fighting moves. The levels and bosses however were entirely original.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 5 Extra Lives[CR]When on the title screen, hold Down, A + B and press Start.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Binary Land is a 1985 action puzzle game developed and published by Hudson Soft. In the game, the player takes control of two penguins, Gurin and Malon. The goal of each level is to reunite the two penguins. The player controls both penguins at the same time. When the player presses up or down on the D-pad, both penguins go in the same direction. When the player presses left or right though, the penguins move in opposite directions. The player can decide at the main menu which penguin that they would like to control as their primary penguin. The primary penguin moves in the same direction that is pressed on the direction pad, and the secondary penguin moves in the opposite direction.[CR]Throughout the levels are spider webs and spiders. The penguins can shoot some sort of beam out of their wings to destroy both of these obstacles. The penguins can get caught in the spiderwebs or eaten by the spiders. If both penguins are caught in the webs or if one of them gets eaten by a spider, the player loses a life and has to start the level over. All of the levels are timed, and if the time runs out before the player is able to reach the exit, then a life is lost. There are occasionally enemy-free bonus stages. The object of a bonus stage is to free one of the penguins who starts the level out trapped in the spider web, collect as many bonus items as possible, and reach the exit before time runs out.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue[CR]Press and hold the A &amp; B buttons on both controllers and press Reset. If done right, the game will change to Love Story mode.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hi- Score[CR]If your score is higher than 30000 pts, press Select button after you die - you will be able to enter your name on the list of the best scores.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa is a Konami platformer for the Famicom that only saw a US localization when the game was released on the Wii Virtual Console. The game is notable for putting the player in the role of an infant, though one that is capable of handling himself.[CR]Originally, the game came out on the Famicom Disk System peripheral for the Japanese Famicom. It was later re-released in cart form for the Famicom in 1993, late in the system's lifespan. The US and Japan Wii Virtual Console releases occurred in 2008.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]In Bio Miracle Bokutte Upa the player takes on the role of Baby Upa the prince of the Akuyo Kingdom. Prince Upa takes on adventure over seven different worlds in order to save Akuyo Kingdom from a dangerous demon named Zai.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Upa defeats his enemies he meets along the way by inflating them with his baby rattle. After inflation Upa can use the enemies to his benefit by bouncing off of them or riding them around. Prince Upa must take care to avoid classic perils like thorns and pits. Power-up items in the game take the form of milk, to restore health, and bells, which give temporary invulnerability.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Stage Select[CR]On the title screen, hold Up+A on pad 1 and hold Down+B on pad 2, and then press Select. "1-1" will appear. Press A until it changes into the desired stage.</plot>

You must find a good position on the lake to fish as the size, type (fish types: Black Bass, Brown Trout, Rainbow Trout, and Pike), quantity of fish, and obstacles vary depending on were you are on the lake. Once you selected your ideal location, you cast out the lure using a power meter and as you slowly reel it back in. You must try to attract the interested fish by wiggling the lure in the water and if the fish grabs the lure you must reel the fish back in making sure that the line does not snap as well as avoiding any obstacles in the way.[CR]To help you have many lures to choose from (more been unlocked as you progress though the game) as well as a guide to tell you how good you currently selected location is. You have one day in game time to catch the biggest Black Bass you can find as at the end of the day the average weight of you caught Black Bass improves or reduces you rating as well overall position.

				<title_clean>Blue Marlin, The</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Blue Marlin is a fishing game developed and published by Hot-B for the NES platform.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Though the ultimate goal is to catch a large marlin, that's far from the only thing on the menu. Additional large, and small, game exist which can boost the score in order to proceed to the next area. The player navigates a small fishing vessel over limited ocean real estate with a lure trailing a little bit behind. In order to initiate a bite, the lure must hover over a swimming shadow in the water. However, if the boat itself drives over a shadow, the animal or animals will scatter.[CR]There are several shadow types to contend with as well as other factors. The most common are the schools of fish which are what the marlin feed on. Follow a school of fish long enough, and a larger shadow could appear behind them which could be a marlin. When the large shadow does appear behind a school, the goal is to maneuver your vessel in a way that the lure is over the large shadow but the vessel isn't scaring the fish away. This can be done either by stopping completely in front of the school and hoping the fish don't bite, or by maneuvering the boat just in front of the fish and slowly moving until the large shadow bites.[CR]In addition to those shadows, there are also whale shadows (which cannot be fished, obviously) and flocks of seagulls. Following either of these things tends to lead to a school of fish or even a lone large shadow.Though the large shadows are marlin-shaped, they aren't necessarily marlins. They can also be swordfish, tuna, or even a great white shark (which can be trouble because they take long to catch and aren't worth much, so they eat up your time)[CR]Once a bit has been initiated, the player comes to another screen with a visual of the fisherman and a visual of the catch in the water( for fish, its just splashes, for any kind of marlin or sworddfish, its a large fin, and for a shark its a shark fin. Both marlins and sharks have their own music themes) in addition to a meter measuring the fish's strength as well as one measuring the tightness of the line.[CR]The goal is to real in the fish without breaking the line. The player can both reel in and let out line in order to keep it from breaking and tire out the fish enough to reel it in. Typically the fight of the fish correlates with the size but some, like barracudas, can put up a lot of fight and turn out to be worthlessly small and timewasting. Once the time is up or a fish has been caught that is large enough to weigh in, the player will be returned to port.[CR]If the biggest catch and others add up to enough points, the player will be promoted to the next area. There are nine areas total, with 3 open at the start and the next 3 opened after scoring enough points. It is not required to go to every port in order to complete the game.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Bokosuka Wars</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR]Bokosuka Wars is a 1983 action-strategy role-playing video game created by Koji Sumii and published by ASCII for the Sharp X1 personal computer, followed by ports to the MSX, FM-7, NEC PC-6001, NEC PC-8801 and NEC PC-9801 computer platforms, as well as an altered version released for the Nintendo Famicom console and later the Virtual Console service. It revolves around a king who must lead an army in phalanx formation across a battlefield in real-time against overwhelming enemy forces while freeing and recruiting soldiers along the way, with each unit able to gain experience and level up through battle. The player must make sure that the leader stays alive, until the army reaches the enemy castle to defeat the leader of the opposing forces.[CR]The game was responsible for laying the foundations for the tactical role-playing game genre, or the "simulation RPG" genre as it is known in Japan, with its blend of role-playing and strategy game elements. The game has also been described as an early example of an action role-playing game, an early prototype real-time strategy game, and a unique reverse tower defense game. In its time, the game was a major success in Japan.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Higher Stats / Fight Without Losing[CR]Press and hold Select + Start then press Reset. Immediately after reset, start shouting to the microphone until the title music starts. If done right, you can start a new game with some altered parameters so you can fight without losing.</plot>

Find the hidden chalice and be saved from eternal doom. Hit the switch. This is war![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Infinite Items / Level Select / Walk Thru Walls[CR]During gameplay, find the Room of Idols (located along the northern wall) by bombing in the appropriate place. This trick will work on any stage with a Lurcher present. Inside the Room of Idols, make sure to get the Megaton Bomb, it is required to make this trick work.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bomberman is a maze-based arcade game, developed by Hudson Soft. The first in the Bomberman series, it unfortunately didn't contain any multiplayer. At the time it was well-received and today it is considered as a genre-defining video game. There has since been countless iterations on its blueprint and huge multiplayer communities around them.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Bomberman is a robot working at a bomb factory who gets bored of making bombs. He hears a rumor that anyone that makes it out from the underground factory gets a wish. Bomberman, desperate to escape, sets out on a journey to the surface. The only thing standing in his way is the factory security guards who will do anything to stop him. Spoiler alert: Bomberman will turn into Runner when he reaches the surface.[CR]Other Versions[CR]The Famicom version differed slightly from the MSX original, so the Famicom version was ported back to the MSX under the title "Bomber Man Special".[CR]European versions were released under the names "Eric and the Floaters" (MSX/Spectrum) and Dyna Blaster (Amiga, Atari ST, and PC)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level passwords[CR]Just type this password on the password screen to access stage 1 -but- have yourself a deadly 14blocks bomb range with detonator and flameproof.</plot>

				<plot>Our hero the white Bomberman (Bomberman Shiro) was walking down the street one day when he witnessed a robbery. It was black Bomberman (Bomberman Kuro) who was the robber. But Black Bomberman knocked White Bomberman to the ground, and than left the money so that he would be framed. Now Bomberman has been taken to jail and must fight his way out of this place using the only method he knows: explosive bombs.[CR]Bomberman is the second Bomberman game in the series and plays similar to the first, only all gameplay has been reduced to a single screen. Your goal however remains the same on a smaller playing area. You are to destroy all enemies on a level and then find the exit to the next one. Bombing the exit is always a bad idea. The occasional power-up will increase your bomb blast, number of bombs on the screen at one time, player speed or give you the ability to walk through walls.[CR]In addition to the single Player game, Bomberman II introduces a Versus Mode for 2 players and a Battle Mode for 3. Your goal in these is to destroy the other players while staying alive yourself.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Area Passwords (JP Version)[CR]This is for the US version of the game; it has digits 1-8 and B-K (without vowels) in the password entry.</plot>

				<title_clean>Boulder Dash</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Boulder Dash is a maze game with added gravity. Players control Rockford, a stick man who navigates a series of caverns filled with Earth, boulders, diamonds and a series of creatures who kill on touch. The concept is simple: collect enough diamonds to escape each level within a time limit. But while Rockford isn't affected by gravity, the boulders and diamonds are -- remove a piece of earth underneath a boulder and it will fall, often setting off a chain reaction of falling debris. So the game plays as a puzzle game; with each move that the player makes, they have to anticipate the consequences.Boulder Dash is one of a very short list of titles that began on home machines that were later transferred to the arcades. In 2006, Atari2600.com developed an Atari 5200 version of the game in conjunction with First Star Software. One iteration of the game was released in 2007 by ZX Games, and is a largely faithful remake of the original over 20 years after its original release. In 2009, a flash-based Browser version was released, sporting updated graphics.Virtual ConsoleThe Commodore 64 version of Boulder Dash was released on to the Wii Virtual Console on June 1st 2009 for 500 Wii Points.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sudden Death[CR]When you are in a deadlock, press A+B together for a sudden death.</plot>

				<title_clean>Bucky O'Hare</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bucky O'Hare was originally a comic book series, written by Larry Hama and drawn by Michael Golden. An animated television series was produced and aired around 1990, and along with it came the requisite toy line.  The anthropomorphic series also spawned a NES game as well as an arcade game.  On March 6, 1991, the last episode of the television series was aired. Afterward, not much has been released in the United States. The only Bucky O'Hare related media has been the release of the original series on Region 2 DVD, and a short 3-D cartoon was made by renowned comic artist Neal Adams. The NES game was developed and released by  Konami and saw  Captain Bucky and his crew appear on a home video game console for the first and only time. The game was hailed as  Konami's answer to  Mega Man and certainly shared many features in common with the series. It was known for it's good level of challenge that was not impossible like a lot of games at the time, but was certainly not easy by any measure, and also its extremely catchy soundtrack and varied settings. In 1992, a Bucky O'Hare arcade game is released, much different than the home console version.  Masato Maegawa, Bucky O'Hare's director and lead programmer, left Konami to co-found  Treasure shortly after completing this project.      [CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Bucky O'Hare is a green hare that captains a ship run by other mammals. He helps lead the United Animals Federation when the evil Toad empire (run by a computer known as KOMPLEX) starts a war with the mammals. In this game, Bucky's crew are taken captive and Bucky must fight to release them, only for them to be taken prisoner once more after Bucky initially rescues them all. Bucky must then battle through several planets to rescue them all, and then take the fight to the Toad Marshall. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As previously mentioned, the gameplay was very similar to that of the  Mega Man series. The game is an action-focused  side-scrolling platformer where you control Bucky or one of his crew (as you progress). The game has many jumping puzzles in it, along with other obstacles that can cause instant death if the player is not careful. On top of this, there are many foes for bucky to contend with such as the classic toads and a good variety of  Bosses.Early on in the game Bucky's crew are taken prisoner, and Bucky must fight to rescue them all. Each crew member is designated to a planet, and each planet is a series of levels leading up to a boss fight which upon completion will return the captive prisoner to the crew. Later in the game, the player can switch between Bucky's crew in game on the fly, to choose a character that suits them or to overcome certain in-game obstacles. Each member has a fairly unique ability. Blinky, for example, can hover above ground temporarily to traverse pits and other perils. Dead Eye Duck has a very useful gun that shoots multiple bullets in a spread arc, Bucky has a charge jump which allows him to reach higher vertical jumps than most. Jenny can charge up a psychic ball of energy which the player can control and move around the screen for a short time before it expires. Willy has a powerful gun which can be charged to become very powerful.The side scrolling was interesting in that the player could go left if they missed something they would have liked, but this could be unwise as the game usually respawns enemies the player had just defeated if the player moves the screen beyond their position. Luckily though, the game featured a  health bar system so the player could take several hits from an enemy before perishing. Also, the player could continue from whatever level they started at even if they run out of lives, but their score will be reset.Bucky O'Hare featured a password system so the player could write down a password and the game would recognise how far through the game they were.  [CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR] Bucky O'HareA green hare, captain of the space ship The Righteous Indignation.  Along with his fellow mammals, he is a high-ranking soldier in the war against the Toad empire.  His personality of typical of many heroes: a strong feeling of patriotism toward the plight of his people, and strong leadership attributes. BlinkyA cyclops robot who constantly used the phrase "Calamity and Woe" whenever something bad happens.  His personality is likened to several other famous robots, mostly a little robot from Lost in Space.... Dead-Eye DuckA duck with a missing eye and four arms, Dead-Eye's personality is very similar to Donald Duck: quick to anger, and very aggressive. JennyA cat from another planet.  Is first mate on the ship The Righteous Indignation, and has secret psychic powers. WillyThe only human in the crew, Willy accidentally teleported onto The Righteous Indignation, and is the ships engineer.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hard Mode[CR]Enter [B]HARD![/B] as your password to make the game much more difficult.</plot>

				<title_clean>Burai Fighter</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Burai Fighter is a shooter that was released for the NES, Game Boy and Game Boy Color. It had different names on each platform; Burai Fighter on the NES, Burai Fighter Deluxe on the Game Boy and Burai Fighter Color in Japan and Space Marauder in the US on the Game Boy Color. The game has two different types of game play levels, described below.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]In Burai Fighter you control a nameless hero whose mission is to defeat the Burai and destroy their seven bases. The Burai are a race of super-brains, who for thousands of years have been trying to take over the universe. They can&#8217;t do it alone however so they have been busy creating armies of robo-mutants. They produce these monsters at their manufacturing bases, which of course you must destroy. You have to face the five Burai: Giganticrab, Jawsipede, Fangskull, Torchwing and finally Slimdragon. You&#8217;ll have an arsenal of weapons and your proton pack to aid you but even then, it&#8217;ll be a challenge.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Burai Fighter is a side-scrolling  shooter that is unique from many other shooters for a variety of reasons.Burai Fighter is unlike most shooters as the game doesn&#8217;t just scroll from one side to the other, it often changes directions and takes different paths. Not all of the game&#8217;s levels are side scrolling though. A few of the levels of played from the top down perspective with the objective being you trying to find a base and destroy it. Before the beginning of these levels you are giving a map showing where you are and where the base is; yes, like a mall map.The game is unique from most other shooters in the fact that you can freely touch any wall without being damaged. In fact it&#8217;s encouraged as there are many hidden rooms with goodies in them. When you stumble upon one, the camera changes path and leads you into the room briefly, then once it&#8217;s scrolled all the way through, begin making it&#8217;s way back to the main path.The HUD shows your  score, lives, your current  weapon, how many upgrades of that weapon you have picked up as well as a bar that fills up whenever you pick up "Cobalt Bombs". The Cobalt Bombs are sometimes dropped by enemies and if you can fill said bar, you will attain an extra life. You can also press the A button if the bar is somewhat filled to do a  special attack which clears everything off the screen.As you play the game there will be weapon upgrades that flash between the three possible weapons. You can continue to pick them up until that specific weapon upgrades to a better version. The first upgrade will occur when you pick up 5 and the last upgrade when you pick up 10.[CR]Weapon Details[CR]Starter Weapon: The typical weapon, like any in any other shooter. The starter weapon shoots bullets the length of the screen.Laser: The Laser can be compared to the starting weapon in that it shoots a straight line and goes the distance of the screen until hitting an obstacle. At the first weapon change you shoot two beams, one in the direction you&#8217;re aiming and another in the opposite direction. The last upgrade allows you to shoot four laser beams in an X pattern.Ring: When using the Ring you shoot a circular disc that can go through walls; the starter weapon also shoots when using the Ring. The first upgrade shoots rings the direction you&#8217;re aiming and the opposite direction. The last upgrade makes you shoot a disc in the opposite direction you're aiming and a spread of three rings the direction you are aiming.Missile: The Missile is similar to the Ring in that when you shoot it, you also shoot the starter weapon. The missile however always shoots forward, even if you are aiming in a different direction. The first upgrade makes missiles shoot to the left and to the right. The final upgrade shoots missiles in every central direction; up, down, left and right.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>BurgerTime</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Title screen.[CR]Burgertime is an Arcade game originally released in 1982. A single-screen platformer game, the stages are a series of platforms with sections that are made of components of a mighty hamburger. These ingredients are placed in the level vertically so that, as the player character walked across them, they would drop until eventually making a complete sandwich at the bottom of the screen. The finished burgers are such titans that it dwarfs the player character. Of note, the servers who would carry this burger to the customers are never shown.[CR]The player controls Peter Pepper, a chef whose objective is to walk, climb and scurry all over the platforms in order to build his burgers. As the chef walks completely across the top of a layer, it will drops one level below, thus knocking the layer beneath down one level also. After all the layers have been dropped onto the platters awaiting below, the burger is complete and the player's score is boosted. When all hamburgers are completed, only then is the level clear. [CR]As with most of the games of the time, the levels become more complex and difficult as the player progresses. This is accomplished through varied platform layouts, more enemies, and an ever-increasing number of burger components. Just like in real life, no-one orders a plain cheeseburger forever. While the chef fights to keep his customers fed and happy, he is besieged by three malcontents of the food industry: Mr. Hot Dog, Mr. Pickle and Mr. Egg. These 3 can be killed temporarily by dropping a layer of the burger on top of them but it is a short-term solution as they reappear at the edge of the screen after a short time. A crafty chef can also make the fiends chase him across a partially walked across layer and then complete it as the enemy steps on to it. The layer will then drop along with the enemy whose weight causes it to drop two levels as opposed to just one. An added benefit to this technique is that it temporarily stuns the enemy. It's possible to crush other enemies beneath the falling enemy and burger as well. Peter Pepper also has a small supply of pepper he can throw in the enemies face to render them harmless for a few seconds. Additional pepper can be acquired by picking up ice cream and other items that will randomly spawn on the level.[CR]PizzaTime, the hotly anticipated sequel was in development when the video game market went into a decline, and sadly was never released.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Transtlaion Description:[CR]Cadillac is a puzzle card game featuring several women that try to take every last bit of money from you. The object of the game is to clear all of the cards at the end of the deck, which can be pretty tricky. During the game, you have cards that come down from the top and make their way to the bottom where you position them to make poker combinations, like three of a kind, 4 of a kind, 5 of a kind, flushes and straights. There are 10 levels to beat in this game. Your reward on a few levels is to see a full screen view of one of the women that host the game. This game is a one or two player game.[CR]There are glitches and flickering in this game that are normally in the non-hacked version of the ROM.[CR]http://romhacking.net/trans/1374/[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Captain ED</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]He really doesn't have to be named Ed.[CR]In Captain Ed, the main character (not necessarily named Ed) must fight his way through space (represented by multi-colored tiles) in order to destroy the "7 Masters of Space". Periodically he will have to stop and buy gas or other items. The seven lucky Gods make an appearance as opposites to the 7 Masters.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls a ship armed with a blaster and a large mallet; they must navigate through "space" - an environment vaguely resembling a disco floor - while avoiding various other spaceships (or preferably destroying them to earn money!). Destroying enemies with the mallet is risky but nets a money bonus. In addition, the player's gas (life) ticks down constantly. It is also reduced by damage from enemies. To counter-act this slow grind to the death, the player must buy more gas. This results in cyclic game play; destroy more enemies to buy more gas. In addition, the color-changing floor has various effects on the ship: On green tiles, gas consumption is at the normal rate, on yellow tiles it is slightly increased. Red tiles rapidly deplete gas and violently shift the spaceship; this can result in difficult situations where the ship is forcibly moved from one red tile to another repeatedly. Blue tiles, only revealed by the pickup of a smiley face, very slightly increase the player's gas, but at such a slow rate it is almost unnoticeable.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Automatically Reach The Boss[CR]While playing, press Select to enter the items screen. Once in the items screen, hold Up, A, B and Select. If done right, you'll warp to the boss of the current level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Boss Rush Mode[CR]Start the game and at the name entry screen, press Right 6 times and enter the Japanese character. Right 1 time, Down 4 times and enter the Japanese character. Up 3 times, Left 2 times and enter the Japanese character. Now hit End to fight only the bosses.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Captain Silver puts the player in control of the dauntless adventurer Jim Aykroyd, as he attempts to fight his way across several stages to locate the lost treasure of the titular pirate. Each version of the game - the Arcade, the Sega Master System and the NES are all slightly different in their execution, but all play mostly the same.[CR]The Arcade version, released in 1987, has a total of three stages. After defeating the now undead Captain Silver at the end of Stage 3, the player restarts the game with slightly tougher enemies to defeat. The US Master System version was released on a 1mb Cart and has a total of four stages, with two pirate captains (including Captain Silver) as bosses. The Master System versions for Europe, Australia and Japan were all the same 2mb Cart version that instead had six stages, with six bosses instead of the US version's two. The Japan-only NES version is the most divergent from the original Arcade game, as it features more platforming and less swordfighting. There are different bosses and stage layouts, a health gauge instead of the one-hit kill rule found in other versions and NPCs that will either help or harm Jim if he talks to them.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Jim fights using his trusty cutlass, which swings horizontally while walking or crouching and vertically when Jim is climbing a ladder. There are a few power-ups Jim can acquire also, those the effectiveness tends to vary per version:Fairies: These provide Jim with magical powers, allowing him to fire projectiles from his sword. They can be powered up a total of six times, increasing the power and size of each projectile.Longsword: A powerful sword that can take out enemy projectiles fired at Jim. It is only available in the Arcade version.Boots: These allow Jim to jump higher and walk faster. Like the Longsword, it is a temporary item. In the Arcade version, if a second pair of boots or a second longsword is found while Jim is still equipped with the previous, they become permanent (at least until Jim loses a life).Treasure: Simply adds to the player's score.Keys: Open treasure chests and item shops, where many of the above items can be bought. The player uses their own score for currency in the Arcade version.Potions: A potion will give Jim a second chance if he is hit, saving him from an untimely demise. In the Master System version this bonus remains with Jim until he needs it, though it's only temporary in the Arcade version.Letters: These symbols can be found after defeating enemies and will give the player an extra life if they find all of them, which spells out "Captain Silver".Weapon Upgrades: Unique to the NES version, these upgrades to Jim's attacking power can be bought in stores with money.[CR]</plot>

Her beauty and grace were known throughout the land - especially to Mad Mizer, the Dark Lord of the grim Groken Castle high in the Forbidden Mountains. He had vowed to make the Princess his queen; and so, one terrible day, he sent his ghoulish helpers to capture her, and she was carried off and imprisoned in one of the hundred miserable rooms of Groken Castle. News of the kidnapping spread throughout the kingdom, and many courageous young men braved the perils of Groken Castle in an attempt to rescue the Princess - only to become hopelessly lost in the complicated maze of rooms, ensnared in one of the many treacherous traps, or foiled by Mad Mizer's deadly servants. Finally the news reached the worthy Prince Rafael, who had long loved the Princess from afar. Raising his sword to the heavens, Prince Rafael swore that nothing would keep him from her side, and set out on his Castlequest. The odds against him seemed hopeless... But legend has it that two magical fairies have been held captive in the Castle for centuries. If the Prince can find and release them to gain their help, he may yet succeed in his quest. And to rescue his fair Princess, he is prepared to face the deadly wrath of the Dark Lord himself![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Go through water without using up Airtank.[CR]First, grab the airtank.

				<title_clean>Chack'n Pop</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Chack'n Pop is a single-screen Arcade game from Taito in which the player is a dexterous bird-like creature named Chack'n. The goal of each stage is to descend to the bottom corner to free a heart from its cage, then head back to the top to stop a little monster from cracking one of Chack'n's eggs. Chack'n is capable of walking along ceilings - sort of like the gravity-switching Captain Viridian of VVVVVV - and can also throw bombs that will eliminate enemies within the radius of their explosions. Enemies appear first as harmless eggs, but soon hatch into tenacious monsters that resemble the Blubbas of Bubble Bobble.[CR]The level design, enemies and other graphical flourishes resemble those of Bubble Bobble, Taito's next big Arcade hit and the game the developers are best known for after Space Invaders. Bubble Bobble honors its spiritual ancestor by reusing one of Chack'n Pop's stages. Like Bubble Bobble, Chack'n Pop also received various home versions after its initial Arcade release, including NES, MSX and Sega SG-1000 versions. It also appears in various Taito Arcade compilations, such as Taito Legends 2 for the PS2.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Challenger</title_clean>
				<plot>One of Hudson Soft's earliest NES titles, Challenger is an arcade-style game that combines side scrolling, run 'n jump action with overhead, exploratory gameplay. The game consists of two parts.[CR]The first level (or "scene") has you racing the clock to get to the front of a train, where a purple-faced villain is holding your significant other (or, perhaps just some anonymous princess). You have at your disposal a trusty throwing knife to take care of enemies. You will also have to dodge obstacles and jump gaps in the train. This section is taken from the earlier Hudson game, Stop the Express.[CR]Scene 2 places you in an overhead, maze-like environment, where you once again have to fight the clock. This time though, you have to navigate your way through the area, in search of all the different "keywords", which are placed in different caves. Once you have cleared all the caves, the path will be open to the boss' final lair.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Stage 1 Invulnerability[CR]At the very start of stage 1, at the top of the train, wait for the timer to go 87 seconds. When you hear a "kan kan" or "tan tan"-like sound (2 quick high notes), throw a dagger on your left. Do this 4 times. The invulnerability will be activated when a bonus score is displayed. The invulnerability lasts only for stage 1.</plot>

				<plot>Championship Bowling plays like a standard 10 frame ten-pin bowling game with the objective to knock down as many pins with the bowling ball as possible.[CR]After picking a lane (5 different designs), a character (4 different characters), and the weight of the bowling ball they will be using, the player is placed on the lane. To bowl the player first picks the location that the bower will bowl from and then, using the Control panel, the player must time it correctly to stop the ball at the desired angle and finally, time it correctly to stop the Power bar at the desired power. The power, and the weight of the ball determine how much effect the control has. Up to four players can play using the NES Four Score accessory with all players taking turns to bowl.</plot>

Intended for players who had already mastered the original, Championship Lode Runner starts off punishingly difficult and only gets more challenging from there.[CR]The Famicom version of the game was exclusive to Japan, as were the NEC PC and Sega SG-1000 versions. This is due to the series' popularity in Japan where, like Spelunker, it accrued a significantly larger fanbase than in its native country.[CR]The game is best known to modern Western audiences for its appearance in the GameCenter CX television show. It was part of a special segment where Arino called up various Japanese citizens for advice and guidance through the exceptionally tough stages.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level passwords[CR]Push select at any time and use A/B to get to the desired level. Push start to get a blank cursor. Push the pad in each given direction, then press A, etc. Passwords work only for the level given. 1-10 need no password.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The lab.[CR] Chip 'N Dale: Rescue Rangers is one of many successful collaborations between  Disney and  Capcom. It is the video game adaptation of the popular Disney cartoon by the same name.[CR]Much like the cartoon, the game revolves around  Chip,  Dale, and their companions in the Rescue Rangers: Monterey "Monty" Jack, the female mechanic Gadget Hackwrench, and the housefly Zipper. The game takes either Chip or Dale through several varied locations on their quest to stop the evil, suit-wearing feline "Fat Cat".[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] / Mechanics[CR]The game is a basic platformer much in the same vein as other Capcom action/platforming games like  Mega Man or  DuckTales. The game utilizes the diminutive size of the characters to create large environments. Before the quest to stop Fat Cat and rescue Gadget is over the player will see the garden stage, the kitchen stage, the casino, the factory, a huge tree and many more. The player selects them from a  Bionic Commando like map and all will involve jumping on huge things in the environment like books, cash registers or trashcans. The game features both single-player or 2-player Co-op. Chip/Dale can also collect Flower "cards" that will often require some searching under boxes to find them all.Stage 1, Neighborhood. Chip has picked up an apple.[CR]The game also draws on the success of  Super Mario Bros 2, specifically the mechanic of picking up and throwing stuff. The same mechanic is in Rescue Rangers where Chip or Dale can pick up objects like apples (or the small boxes that are always scattered around the levels) and throw them at the enemy to stun or knock them out. They can also throw their co-op partner. Similar to  New Super Mario Bros Wii, this mechanic is more often humorously used for competition than cooperation, throwing the partners into enemies or off cliffs. Zipper the bee acts as the invincibility star. On the rare occasion when the player finds him, they can mow down everything in their path.[CR]The game includes many big bosses and defeating them often includes picking up objects and throwing them at their weak spots. The final boss fight pits the players against Fat Cat himself, where Chip and Dale must dodge the remains being flicked from a cigar while throwing a ball at Fat Cat's face.[CR]</plot>

Its a sidescrolling action game where the player has to shoot, kick, jump and duck to overcome a plethora of baddies. Before the player selects a stage, they have to select one of five heroes, each with their own amount of health and weapon type. They also have a limited use special attack that can clear the screen of enemies. At the end of each level the hero jumps inside a giant robot and engages in a one-on-one duel with the boss of that level. [CR]The game features four difficulty levels (2 hidden),  a password system, and a "Battle mode" in which the player can practice fighting against any of the bosses.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A fortune-telling game that uses Eastern mysticism to prognosticate on the player's future, based on their year of birth. Though fortune-telling devices weren't unheard of, this was the first NES "game" to provide such a service. It would, however, be followed almost immediately with Induction Produce's '89 Dennou Kyuusei Uranai; another fortune-telling interactive simulator.[CR]The player can choose to receive their fortune in distinct areas of their lives, including romantic prospects, the best time to marry their partner and the outcome of their future business dealings. Due to the minimal impact and relative obscurity of Eastern horoscopes in the west, the game was never released outside of Japan, though the US would eventually receive their own equivalent with Taboo: The Sixth Sense.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Fill The Names List[CR]While on the Name List menu, hold Left and press B on the number 1 and number 6 to automatically fill the names list.</plot>

				<plot>All right, before this review even begins, I want to get one thing out of the way. I suck. A lot. Maybe I suck at this game, maybe just shooters, maybe just games in general. The fact remains that I suck. Okay. As you can guess, this is a nice little shooter game. And it's very well done too, unlike most shooters you see out there these days. And by that I mean mostly Action 52 and Color Dreams games. But there are lots of bad ones, just none come to mind. Anyway, you shoot stuff. And it's hard. To me. One hit kills you, and throws you back to either the midpoint or the beginning. It's just like R-Type, only a lot harder because the game's so cutesy and you KNOW you can beat this silly little cutesy game to a pathetic bloody pulp with your mad gaming skillz, but you just CAN'T. But maybe that's just me. Oh, and there's some slowdown. Pretty cool. And the backgrounds look really neat! Okay I'm done.[CR][B]Description:[/B][CR]Um, there's probably some text in here that's been translated. I can't beat stage 1, so I don't know too much about what's been done. Bah. Who knows.[CR]Reviewer: Spinner 8[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/103/[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Auto-Fire[CR]Start a new game, then at the "READY!" screen press Down + B once. A sound will confirm correct code entry. Now you can hold A or B buttons to fire automatically. This cheat will be disabled after the game over screen.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Circus Charlie is a circus-themed collection of mini-games, most of which involving jumping or over things. The player controls the titular Circus Charlie, a clown, as he attempts to perform stunts such as leaping off trapeze swings and riding circus animals through hoops of fire in order to entertain the audience.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The acts Charlie must perform include:Lion Taming - Charlie rides a lion through rings of fire and over flaming pots. There are smaller rings of fire which can be avoided easily enough, but they also provide additional bonus points.Tightrope Walking - Charlie must keep his balance as he walks across a tightrope. He must avoid the monkeys by jumping over them - blue ones in particular move very quickly so the player must keep alert.Ball Balancing - Charlie must make his way across a series of large, striped balls that spin in place. Since Charlie jumps a specific distance that cannot be altered, the player must judge the correct distance between the ball they're on and the one they're aiming for and jump at the right moment.Trick Riding - Charlie is riding a pony and must hop off and jump on trampolines as they pass overhead. Keeping a rhythm will allow Charlie to land back on the pony once the trampolines have passed.Trapeze Swinging - Charlie must leap between each trapeze swing as they reach the end of their arc in order to reach the next one. He can also use the trampolines beneath to move from one swing to the next.[CR]With each of these events the player can earn additional bonus points by performing risky or difficult actions and pulling them off, thus entertaining the crowd even more. These include the smaller fire rings during the Lion Taming act, jumping over multiple monkeys during the Tightrope or hopping across several trampolines in a row with the Trick Riding event. The player can earn extra lives by earning a lot of points on all these events. After completing any of the five acts, the player can opt to play a more difficult version of the same challenge for additional points.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>City Adventure Touch - Mystery of Triangle</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]City Adventure Touch: Mystery of Triangle is a brawler game based on a slice-of-life manga named Touch that follows the soapish high school struggles of a pair of twin brothers, Tatsuya and Kazuya, and their next door neighbor Minami. The story of the game has very little to do with the down-to-earth manga, instead focusing on an alternate dimension the three fall into while chasing Punch, the twins' Samoyed dog.[CR]The game plays like a prototypical brawler, with the three characters able to fight off enemies on a field with a degree of depth, similar to Double Dragon and other early brawlers of the era. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]Press and hold the A &amp; B buttons on both controllers and press Reset. If done right, the game will start on the sound test.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]City Connection has one or two players (taking turns) driving through a total of five different cities.

Several obstacles attempt to stop the player's car such as police cars, cats and spike strips. Once all blocks in a level have been painted, the player moves on to the next stage. Random red balloons will appear, if the player grabs three in the same level, it will warp them ahead a few levels and provide bonus points. Even if the player ends up back in New York, the difficulty will stay the same as the previous level warped from.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]Each level has its own musical track, although they all resemble "Allegro non troppo e molto maestoso" from Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No.1.[CR]Roots[CR]City Connection's general gameplay is similar to Miner 2049er which was released on several platforms including the Apple II, Atari 2600 and 5200, Commodore 64 and ColecoVision. In that game the player must fully investigate mines.[CR]</plot>

The enemies, Unira, can be stunned if Bubbles uses an attack, and then pushed into a wall to kill them. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 9 Extra Lives[CR]At the Main Title Menu</plot>

				<title_clean>Cocoron</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]  Tapir, outside his House.     The story starts with the introduction of Tapir, a magical tapir capable of creating dreams. The goal of the game is to rescue Princess Mua, who has been captured by the evil wizard Baku. He has also captured the fairy Cocoron, something you find out after rescuing his brother, Cocorin, from the Fairy Queen. Eventually, after helping various people across the world, you find Princess Mua trapped in an egg just outside the Fairy Forest. It is at this point that it is revealed that Tapir is actually the evil wizard Baku, and he intends to eat all the dreams. However, the player beats him twice and stops him from fulfilling his ambitions, saving the world in the process. [CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Instead of progressing through levels in a linear fashion, you choose a path leading from one level to another via a map screen. Levels are determined by which two areas are linked, meaning there are 15 possible levels to play through. This does not include the levels near the end of the game, which the player progresses through in a linear fashion. You start at the House, and can return at any time to switch characters. The only exception is during the final levels, wherein the last character you played as is the only one remaining, and all others need to be rescued in Baku's Castle. Level Name and LocationBoss     Fairy Forest Fairy Queen     Trump Castle Joker     Star Hill Harvest Moon     Milk Sea Flint the Pirate     Ice-Fire MountainSilver Dragon     House None[CR]General Gameplay [CR]  The player fighting against a boss: the Silver Dragon.     Like other platformers, the player progresses through levels, shooting enemies and jumping from platform to platform. When killed, enemies drop eggs. These eggs contain either hearts (used to restore HP), extra lives, invincibility orbs, or icons of whatever weapon the player has equipped, used to level up said weapon at least four times. These upgrades not only make the weapon more powerful, but also change how the weapon behaves. For example, shurikens eventually shoot out from multiple directions, umbrellas shoot multiple projectiles upward, pencils cover a wider area and fire more projectiles, etc. Large eggs occasionally appear within levels, housing either the previously mentioned power-ups, or a few enemies. At the end of each level waits a boss, although it only needs to be fought once, meaning subsequent playthroughs of the level will not end with a boss fight; in fact, several bosses actually help you after beating them. When fighting, the     HUD is changed to reflect both the player's health and the boss's. [CR]Character Customization [CR]  The character customization screen.     One of the main features of Cocoron is      the ability to create up to six completely unique characters. There are 8 classes of head, body, and weapon, each with three, two, and one choice, respectively. Therefore, there are over 3000 possible characters to create. Although each body contains an exclusive ability (tanks don't slide down slopes, boats float on water, wings/jets can float temporarily, etc.), this only holds true for each class of body; the choice of a specific body is mostly an aesthetic one, something that also applies to the heads. Each body/head type also comes with a certain weight and    HP count. Weight determines how high a character can jump and how fast they move: HP affects the amount of damage a character can endure before death. Weapons also have weights, but instead of HP, they have attack power. The specific stats for each body type, head type, and weapon are listed below.Bodies Body NameWeightHP Armor 433 24 Wing 101 8 Jet 499 16 Cyborg 301 20 Boat 234 12 Buggy 167 16 Tank 367 20 ?* 344 Heads Head NameWeightHP Hero 15612  Ninja 112 8 Robot 289 16 Alien 260 4 Fighter 333 16 Monster 245 12 Ghost 67 8 ?* 23 4WeaponsWeapon NameWeightAttack Parasol 713 Boomerang 934 Shuriken 1416 Ball 474 Pencil 253 Crystal 1673 Flower 1163 Melody 113 *These are the actual names listed in the English fan translation of Cocoron[CR]Sequel [CR]At some point, a sequel was planned for the Turbo CD. It was called PC Cocoron (named after the Japanese of the   Turbografx-16: the PC Engine), and screenshots of it appeared in magazines at the time. While it was never released, there are rumors that some people own the ROM of the game, although any form of the game (physical or virtual) has yet to surface officially.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Conflict</title_clean>
				<plot>Conflict is a turn-based, hex-grid wargame for the NES that can be played by one or two players.  It is not a strictly historical wargame in which battles of the past are recreated using real-world geography.  Instead, the two opposing sides (Blue vs. Red) fight it out across 16 imaginary scenarios with armies modeled on NATO and Warsaw Pact forces of the late 1980s. [CR]The game alternates between two modes of play: a strategic/operational scale, in which players move their units around the hex map; and a tactical combat module for resolving unit-to-unit combats.  In the tactical mode, human players have the choice of either issuing orders themselves or using the "auto" mode which delegates command to the AI.[CR]Splash graphics and text messages convey battle results.[CR]By capturing towns and winning battles, the player gains "fame" points that can be used to purchase more and better military hardware.  Every scenario ends only when the same, single victory condition is achieved by one of the two sides: destroy the opposing side's main battle tank unit in combat.[CR]Winning any one of the first 15 scenarios yields a letter of the alphabet; together, the letters spell out the password that must be entered in order to play the final scenario.</plot>

				<title_clean>Contra</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Contra (the arcade version was known as Gryzor in Europe, while the NES version was released as Probotector) is a 1987 video game developed and published by Konami. The player controls a large, muscular soldier as he battles his way through waves of foes. Most of its popularity is credited to its two player co-op mode, a rarity at the time. While the arcade version was popular, the series really began to take off when it was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988. Since then, the game has been ported to numerous systems and has had many sequels.[CR]The game's music was composed by Hidenori Maezawa and Kyouhei Sada.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A rare calm moment.[CR]The goal of the game is to traverse several side-scrolling levels. Equipped with a default machine gun, the player has to repeatedly tap the button to fire, something that is changed in the game Contra III: The Alien Wars. Unlike many other games at the time, the player can still fire while jumping. Other weapons can be collected as well by firing upon flying machines that appear in the level. Other weapons included are a machine gun, a laser, a flame thrower and the spread shot. The player can also pick up a power up that enables the player to shoot faster.[CR]There are two different types of levels. First, there is the traditional side-scrolling level, but the second is a third-person shooter. In the third-person shooter levels, the player must explore several rooms in which the player must destroy enemies coming into the room, and destroy the cannons within the room. After defeating all of the rooms a boss is faced. A boss's weak point is often identified by a flashing animation. Guns that available in the side-scrolling level are also available in the third-person levels.Guns[CR]While Konami never gave official names to the various guns &amp; power-ups, the community at large has come up with commonly accepted names for them:~=M=~ : Machine Gun - The machine gun does more damage than the default rifle, which is indicated by its slightly larger bullets. The rate of fire remains the same as the default rifle.~=S=~ : Spread Gun- Possibly the most sought after power-up in the game. "S" replaces the default rifle with a machine gun that fires five bullets in a wide arc in front of the player. However, the gun comes with a limitation: players can only have ten bullets on the screen at the same time. So if the player presses the fire button if there are already seven bullets on the screen, the gun will only fire three more bullets. A common workaround for this problem is to get very close to the target before spamming the fire button. This tactic dramatically increases the gun's damage done per second.~=F=~ : Flare Gun - Shoots slow-moving balls of fire. Only four are allowed on screen at the same time.~=L=~ : Laser Gun - Each laser shot does 8 bullets worth of damage, but only one laser shot is allowed on the screen at a time. Firing again will cancel the existing laser on screen. This limits the gun's effectiveness in dealing with multiple enemies.Power-Ups~=R=~ : Rapid Fire - Temporarily increases the rate of fire for whichever gun is equipped.~=B=~ : Barrier - Temporarily makes the player invulnerable to damage and gives them a deadly touch, where they can destroy any enemy by simply touching them.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Players take on the roles of Bill Rizer and Lance Bean (codenamed Mad Dog and Scorpion) as they protect earth from an alien invasion known only as Red Falcon. The aliens are supposed to have arrived from a mysterious meteor sixty years previous to the events of the game.[CR][B]Secrets/Cheats:[/B][CR]Konami Code[CR]While the Konami Code debuted in Gradius, it achieved legendary status with the incredibly difficult Contra. Using the code, players instantly receive 30 lives, making the game much easier. To activate the code, the player must press: Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A and then press Start (but Start can be pressed before the code is typed, as well).Steal Lives[CR]Another series staple. If one player dies in the two player cooperative mode and runs out of lives, that player can steal lives from the other player by holding down A and B simultaneously.Shoot while ducking (Base 1 &amp; 2)[CR]Normally, players can't shoot while ducking during these levels. But there is a workaround: Hold 'Up' on Controller 2 while ducking using Controller 1. This will result in the bullets being shot at a higher angle, even though the player is prone.Hard Difficulty / New Game[CR]After players beat the game and the credits are done rolling, they can start over with their remaining lives and the same weapon they finished the game with. The game is harder as a result of increased enemy count. The enemies themselves are stronger and shoot more often.Secret Ending (Japanese Version only)[CR]During the ending, hold down Start and Select before the credits start rolling and keep holding it until they are done. This results in a secret ending where Red Falcon vows his revenge.[CR]Regional Differences[CR]Probotector[CR]The European release of Contra was renamed and graphically modified. The arcade version had been released under the name Gryzor but with the same graphics. When the home NES version was going to be released in the PAL region they had to change some of the graphics due to German censorship policies. The name was changed to Probotector a mix of the words Robot and protector, the player characters were changed to robots as well as some enemies.[CR]The Contra protagonists became robots RD008 and RC011, and almost all enemies received a mechanized makeover. European gamers generally remember fondly the Probotector games, as well as similarly-themed games such as Turrican.Japanese and NTSC Differences[CR]In Japan, Konami could improve some aspects of their videogames by utilizing chips inside the cartridges themselves (much like the SNES's Super FX chip), thus overcoming some of the Famicom's limitations.[CR]Contra received a full intro sequence, an extended ending sequence and small cutscenes in between levels with a short report and a minimap depicting where the player is headed next, as well as a large figure of the protagonist firing a gun or listening to a radio. Also, some of the background pieces gained animations, such as the waving trees in the Jungle and Snow Field, and the twitching organic landscape of The Alien's Lair.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]At the title screen, press and hold Up, Left and the A button. While holding these buttons, press Start and immediately hold Select. If done correctly, the stage select screen should appear.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hard Difficulty[CR]After you beat the game, the credits roll by and you start over with the remaining lives you had. You will also start with the gun you had. This time around, there will be more enemies. They will also shoot a lot more, and some enemies may have more hit points.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Commence planetary bombardment. [CR]The object of the game is to get the opponent to surrender their home world by crushing them utterly in combat. The two sides are the Gradians and the Bacterians; the Bacterians closely resemble their design from the MSX version of Salamander. Each side controls a home system; travel between the systems is achieved by warp points, which resemble worm holes. The player can choose to play against the computer, or can select a two-player mode for a match with a friend. The game has some amusing treats for the observant player; if the player completes the single-player mode, the brain golem of Salamander makes a cameo, apparently having been the computer player the whole time. In addition, many of the Bacterian commanders have names based off of sci-fi authors, such as "Hubbard" and "Bradbury". [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A sample system; in this case Andromeda. [CR]Each match is divided in to both turns and phases. When one player completes all of his phases, the other player's turn begins. Combat initiates a special mode where combat continues until resolved; however, it still passes back and forth between players, it simply skips the other phases until one fleet or the other is defeated or until 3 sets of turns pass, whichever comes first. Both players start off with a set amount of resources; further income is generated each turn based on the number of worlds controlled. However, note that various other factors can influence this, including economic turmoil, which can make a player receive no income for a turn and consequently can put their war effort in disarray![CR]Each player begins in their home system; resources are generated here, ships are manufactured here, etc. A player can have up to 16 fleets active at any given time. in addition, each fleet can be composed of 16 (or less) units. Every fleet must be commanded by a flag ship. Each system also has a variety of "space terrain" ( these range from more conventional spacial bodies such asteroids, nebula clouds, etc. to Gradius staples like crystal fields or space cells) which can have positive or negative effects on ships fighting in or moving through them.Phases The construction phase. The bacterians are constructing a diabolical fleet![CR]The following is the order in which the phases appear. Manufacturing Phase: The player gets to expend resources to manufacture ships for their fleets. Note that it takes one whole turn to complete manufacturing; ships are not available immediately.Commander Phase: The player gets to hire commanders for his or her fleets in this phase. The player gets to offer a certain amount of money (resources) and various captains will offer their services. Captains have different abilities which will affect the performance of their fleet in battle; I.E., some will make ships more resilient, more maneuverable, more accurate, etc. This phase requires the player's best judgement; once an offer is placed, the player cannot backtrack unless they choose to higher no captains at this time. Even if they offer a large amount of money, they may get unlucky and only worthless captains will offer their services. Likewise, they could offer a very small amount and an exception captain could appear!Formation Phase: In this phase, players get to build fleets for their captains to command. A captain must be assigned a fleet and placed in a flagship in order for a fleet to be composed. Each captain can have up to 16 ships total in their fleet, although beyond that the makeup is up to the player.Galactic Movement Phase: In this phase, the player can move his fleets via warp points to other systems as they see fit.Combat Phase: The players have the option to initiate combat in this phase if they feel so inclined. Obviously combat can only be initiated if opposing fleets are within range of each other. This causes both players to enter the aforementioned combat mode, with a total of six turns of combat before a temporary cessation. Players can also target claimed planets in this phase in an effort to wipe out the occupying forces and infrastructure and claim it as their own territory.Normal Movement Phase: The player can fine-tune the position of his ships in this phase, moving them about the star system they're currently in.Investment Phase: Players can improve the infrastructure of newly occupied planets in this phase, increasing their overall income. Once this phase is complete, the player's turn ends and the next player begins their turn.[CR]Units[CR]Both sides of the conflict have 16 different units at their disposal. Most of the units are nominally the same despite name variations and difference appearances to maintain balance between the two sides. Gradians Buster-hou... UTEEEEEE!  Flagship: A powerful Gradian flagship. These are required to lead a fleet. A captain must be placed in this for it to be deployed; he or she will add bonuses to the accompanying fleet. If it's destroyed the entire fleet is routed, so be careful!Battleship type A: A ship with very powerful offense and good range. However, it cannot target units that are adjacent, and cannot move and attack in the same turn. It is a staple of any fleet.Battleship type B: It is slightly cheaper to manufacture than the type A. However, it has exclusively long-range weapons; consequently, it can't target enemies that are near it (even more of an issue than with the regular battleship)Heavy cruiser: A solidly built ship which is capable of both long range and short range combat. Another fleet staple. They're a little expensive, but unfortunately less solidly built than a battleship. Light cruiser: A more maneuverable but less sturdy version of the heavy cruiser. It's a little bit cheaper. Destroyer type A: A smaller ship that is capable of short and long range combat. In addition, it can lay mines. Destroyer type B: A smaller, cheaper destroyer that is less mobile. It can lay mines as well.Missile ship: A flimsy ship with powerful missiles. Because of their high attack power and cheap manufacturing cost, these are a good throw-away ship. The player will lose a lot, but they'll take stuff down with them!Tender: For those not in the know, a tender is a ship designed to service other ships at sea. In any case, this ship can resupply other ships in the fleet with weapons as needed. It is virtually incapable of offense otherwise.D-Submarine: Submarines in space? Anyway, this ship is extremely heavily armored and is immune to the effects of terrain (i.e., meteors) but is is very slow moving and difficult to utilize. Scout Ship: A weak and largely useless scout vessel. However, it's the cheapest unit in the game.Space Carrier: What one would expect, a large ship designed to carry smaller ships in to combat. These are required to safely transport small fighters (such as Vic Vipers or the battle suits) through warp points; once fighters are in a system they can move about freely, but if they travel through a warp without a carrier, they are lost! Carriers are relatively sturdy, but weak on offense.Vic Viper: The classic Gradius ship. It's a cheap to build and fairly strong fighter, and is extremely maneuverable. Good for getting deep in the enemy fleet and taking out their battleships from close range!Battle Suits: Squads of mobile suits. While not quite as fast as the Viper, they are a bit sturdier and will last a long time. OPS: Simple ships which can be deployed as planetary defense. They are weak but cheap. Buster Cannon: The buster cannon can fire an extremely powerful beam which can totally annihilate large groups of enemy forces. However, it cannot move and fire and is totally defenseless and weak if enemies get in close. Use carefully!Bacterians A bacterian cyber suit.Bacterian: A powerful Bacterian flagship, unabashedly named after their own species. These are required to lead a fleet. A captain must be placed in this for it to be deployed; he or she will add bonuses to the accompanying fleet. If it's destroyed the entire fleet is routed, so be careful! Big Core: The seminal classic. It is similar to the Battleship Type A. Little Core: Much the same as the Battleship Type B, it has issues with enemy ships that are too close to it.Heavy Cruiser: Identical to the Gradian heavy cruiser, albeit with a creepy design.Light cruiser: A more maneuverable but less sturdy version of the heavy cruiser. It's a little bit cheaper.Destroyer type A: A smaller ship that is capable of short and long range combat. In addition, it can lay mines. Destroyer type B: A smaller, cheaper destroyer that is less mobile. It can lay mines as well. Missile ship: Identical to the Gradian missile ship, but of course with a different design.Tender: Identical to the Gradian tender in all but design.D-Submarine: Unsurprisingly the same as the Gradian version; it has the same issues in terms of usefulness, but with a different design. Cyber Eye: Much the same as the Gradian scout ship, it's once again largely worthless in combat, but cheap.Zellos: The Zellos ship serves as the carrier for the Bacterian navy.Vic Cyber: A cheap Bacterian counterfeit of the Viper, it performs much the same function. Cyber Suits: Identical to the Gradian Battle Suits, but with an organic twist.APS: The Bacterian equivalent of the OPS.Cyber Gun: The Bacterian equivalent of the Buster Cannon, it is functionally the same.  Run for it![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 2nd &amp; 3rd Quests[CR]At the game mode screen, highlight "All Right?" and hold the following buttons:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Infinite Warps[CR]After using a warp, instead of choosing "next", choose "End" and when the "Side Change" message comes up, press B to say no. Now you'll be able to use the warp again.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Uchuu Keiji Gyaban is a well-regarded tokusatsu (superhero) Japanese TV show known in the West as Space Sheriff Gavan, Space Cop Gabin and - in this case of this licensed game - Cosmo Police Galivan.[CR]Nihon Bussan created an Arcade game based on the TV show in 1985 and then followed it up with a slightly different take on the license for the Nintendo Famicom. It would later be followed with a SNES sequel, Cosmo Police Galivan II: Arrow of Justice. Neither game would be released outside of Japan.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Cosmo Police Galivan puts the player in control of a human being armed with a beam blade, which is only able to attack monsters in close proximity. As the game continues, the player character can use different powers - some ranged - to take out enemies and progress further. Eventually, the player will have the option of becoming a metal-armored officer with considerably more fire-power, though this power-up state will vanish if too much damage is taken. The player character will also level-up after destroying so many enemies, improving their health and "cosmo points" - a stat similar to mana that is used to power the player character's special attacks.[CR]The game's world is a network of caves that the player can explore for necessary items and bonus areas. The NES version expands this aspect, providing some Metroidvania-esque exploration. Some impediments are in place to restrict further exploration until the right item is found, as well.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Crayon Shin-chan - Ora to Poi Poi</title_clean>
				<plot>First off, let me say that I am not at all a fan of Crayon Shin-Chan. At all. It's this manga that seems tailor-made for giggling twelve-year-olds, and it ends up being completely juvenile and insipid to anyone else who reads it, unlike cool children's books, like The Monster at the End of This Book. God damn, that was an awesome book. How could you not love that? Anyways yeah, maybe I shouldn't be reviewing this. Or playing it.[CR]So this game is a weird versus puzzle-type game where you push blocks of two into a playing field, with the goal of getting them all on your opponent's side, or something like that. It all seems pretty silly and random to me.[CR]Translation Description[CR]Not much is translated, just various graphics, and a chunk of the first scenario thingy.[CR]Reviewer: Spinner 8[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/759/[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Crazy Climber</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Crazy Climber is a 1980 Nihon Bussan arcade game in which the player must scale a tall building while avoiding dangers during their ascent. It is in some part inspired by the "Human Fly" craze of the late 70s.[CR]The game was eventually released on the Famicom in 1986 and came bundled with a special controller that allowed the player to control both arms of the climber. It was also available on other home systems, such as the Atari 2600.[CR]It is one of Nichibutsu's most highly acclaimed video games in its library. A precursor to the platformer genre, Crazy Climber was the first game revolving around climbing, specifically climbing buildings, before Nintendo's seminal 1981 release Donkey Kong.[CR][B]Lives:[/B][CR]The player is awarded 3 lives at the beginning of each games. An extra life is given after the players reaches 30,000 points.[CR][B]Score:[/B][CR]For every story of the building climber, the player scores1st Building - 100 points2nd Building - 150 points3rd Building - 200 points4th Building - 250 pointsBonus Points[CR]Bonus points are awarded when after successfully climbing each building and the climber is carried off by the helicopter. However, the bonus score decreases every ten seconds that the climber spends ascending the building.1st Building - 10,000 points2nd Building - 20,000 points3rd Building - 30,000 points4th Building - 40,000 points[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]An Arcadia 2100 port was in the works, but never got released.Musical themes in the game include Baby Elephant Walk, The Pink Panther and The Entertainer.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]In 1981, Bandai Electronics manufactured a hand-held VFD version of the game.The game has also been ported to the Atari 2600 and the Japanese Famicom.A Japanese-only sequel, Crazy Climber 2, was produced in 1988. The game was essentially identical to Crazy Climber in gameplay but featured more sophisticated graphics and a few new features.On February 3, 1996, Hyper Crazy Climber was released only in Japan for the PlayStation. It has similar gameplay to that of the original game but also a few differences. Players can choose between three cartoony characters, each with their own strength/speed attributes. Several buildings can be selected from a Bomberman-style map screen, including an underwater building, a medieval clock tower, a haunted skyscraper, and a beanstalk. Power-ups are also used.On March 2, 2000, Crazy Climber 2000 was released for the PlayStation. This is more of a remake of the original arcade game using 3D graphics for the first time. A notable feature is the ability to turn corners and access different sides of the buildings, which now have a variety of designs (including one with a cylindrical, tower-like shape). The game included the original port of the arcade Crazy Climber and a scan of the instruction panel. Like Hyper Crazy Climber which released for the same console 4 years earlier, Crazy Climber 2000 was released only in Japan.On July 21, 2005, Japanese publisher HAMSTER released the arcade version of Crazy Climber under their Oretachi Geasen Zoku Sono (&#12458;&#12524;&#12383;&#12385;&#12466;&#12540;&#12475;&#12531;&#26063;) classic game line for the PlayStation 2.Another sequel or remake, Crazy Climber Wii was released for the Wii in Japan on December 20, 2007, but no North American or European release date has been confirmed.The arcade game was later re-released on the Virtual Console in Japan on February 23, 2010.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Special Pattern[CR]On Normal Pattern Stages 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, and 8, you can find a key in the level taking you to a 2D platformer stage. In that stage, you can get a medal (two on the Stage 3 and 7 stages). Once you obtain all eight medals from the Normal Pattern stages, you then can progress to the Special Pattern stages.</plot>

				<title_clean>Crisis Force</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B]  [CR] Crisis Force is a vertical shooter that takes place in a futuristic egyptian setting. Developed by Konami, this title features ship shifting as well as seven stages and boss battles at the end of each stage. Also featured is an energy system that allows the player's ship to take a hit without instantly exploding. Instead, the ship loses all of its accumulated energy and powerups, becoming vulnerable to any second projectile that can finish it off. The game can be played in single player or coop 2-player mode. As an 8-bit game developed during the transition to the 16-bit era of video games, it takes full advantage of the NES hardware. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR] The gameplay is standard for the genre of vertical shooters, but it offers no score system. A ship starts with two lives and must make its way through a variety of levels without exploding by avoiding projectiles and shooting down enemies. Ship powerups, gun upgrades, bombs, and speed upgrades make an appearance in Crisis Force. Ship Shifting                   By pressing the change key (B by default), a ship can assume a different form with different firing patterns that depend on certain sequences of powerups. With three forms to choose from, changing ship configurations during combat can be very useful in certain situations. For instance, an enemy may sweep behind you and it is helpful to be able to fire backwards.  In addition, collecting a certain powerup (Blue orb surrounded by gold/orange) increments a counter at the bottom-left side of the screen. Once this counter reaches 5, the ship is automatically transformed into a more powerful ship with huge firepower and the ability to take hits (at the cost of energy points that appear at the bottom-left at the screen). This ship will stay transformed until the energy meter reaches 0. This ship loses energy when it is hit, but it gains energy when receiving the same power up that enabled the transformation.            The ship's ultimate form      Powerups    Powerups can come from a variety of sources, but they are usually delivered via helpful drop-ships that you can shoot to release the power-up.   Blue Orb powerups help transform the ship into its ultimate form as seen above under Ship Shifting.  'S' powerups change ship speed. Collecting this powerup when it is blue speeds up your ship. Red has the opposite effect.  'P' powerups are bombs. Holding fire (A by default) while pressing the charge button will release a bomb.  Gun upgrades are blue or red surrounded by a greyish outline. These upgrades alternate colors as they are on the screen. Each color represents a gun path. By only selecting red gun upgrades, your ship will upgrade on the red path (R1 -&amp;gt; R2 -&amp;gt; R2). By selecting blue your ship will upgrade on the blue upgrade path (B1 -&amp;gt; B2 -&amp;gt; B3). If, say, your ship has three red upgrades and accidently you receive a blue upgrade, you will be switched to the level on the Blue path and must retrieve a red power up again to regain red gun upgrades. A powerup vessel awaits       Upon taking a hit, all powerup abilities are lost. HUD The top left corner displays number of lives (beside red orb) and the number of bombs (B). The bottom left corner displays the count of powerups that are needed to change your ship to its most powerful form. Lives  If your ship explodes, a life is taken from your lives counter. Extra lives sometimes appear in game. Be sure to grab them. It is game over if you run out of lives, though you get 3 continues that allow you continue from the latest level with 2 lives.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR] Stage 1: An entry scene as the ship enters a large city (assume Tokyo) that is under heavy laser fire and enemy occupation.  Stage 2: Several insectoid creatures make their appearance. The boss is an alien creature.  Stage 3: A vast canyon level that features walls that must be dodged as well as enemies that scale the sides of the canyon that must be avoided.  Stage 4: A level filled to the brim with fire and volcanos.  Stage 5: A water level filled with egyptian ships with great firepower.  Stage 6: A futuristic Egyptian level chock full of lasers.  Stage 7: End Boss fight. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cycle Race - Road Man, sometimes with the subtitle Gekisou!! Nihon Isshou 4000km, is a top-down cycling racing game for the NES. The player needs to tap the B button to build up speed and then use the D-pad to guide the cyclist along the road without crashing or slowing down too much. However, the player must be aware of the cyclist's damage (which drops each time the cyclist crashes) and power (which acts as the cyclist's stamina and drops if the player pedals too much) as the race will be over if either bar completely empties.[CR]The player can select from four teams (from the four respective countries of Japan, USA, Italy and France) and choose between five cyclists in each team, each with a different assortment of strengths and weaknesses. After each race (or stage of the race, as this is a 4000km marathon) the player can earn points they can invest into a new bicycle with better stats.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bike Replace[CR]During gameplay, press Down and B on the first controller to ask for bike replacement at any time.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Stage Passwords[CR]Select "Password" at the title screen to get to the password screen.</plot>

				<plot>The second Super Robot War is the first canonical episode, where all the basic fundaments of the story and system are set for the rest of the series.[CR]The story begins when a magnificent scientist discovers that Earth is being threatened, and he decides to construct the world's mightiest robot in order to combat the threat. In order to support his plan, he sets up a secret organisation called Divine Crusaders (D.C.), which embarks on a conquest of the entire planet. Only a few heroic robot pilots from popular animated TV series stand in the way of D.C.[CR]SRW 2 is a turn-based strategy game played on a map. What sets it apart from typical war games is the fact that each of your unit is unique, with a unique personality and traits which directly control the outcome of the story. The story is told through scripted events in the scenario and through dialogue between and during battles. This makes the game as much an RPG game as a strategy game. All battles are illustrated using small animated sequences with the robots drawn in a cutesy super-deformed style.[CR]Each side takes turn in the game to move units and fight. Each unit has a different movement value, altered by the terrain it is moving in (unless the unit is airbourne). When a unit is moved within range of an enemy, it can usually attack, though certain attacks are not available directly after moving. Weapons vary in usefulness against airbourne, ground-based or submarine units, and also have varying levels of accuracy, which is weighed against the reaction time of the target. Each unit has two different weapons, usually a remote weapon such as a gun and a hand-to-hand combat weapon such as fists or swords. Certain units trade a weapon for the ability to repair others. Another special unit is White Base, the flying carrier. Robots may enter the carrier to be carried over larger distances while being repaired at the same time and launched directly into a confrontation. White Base is both heavily armoured and in possession of weapons with a long range.[CR]The most apparent difference between Dai-2-ji Super Robot Taisen and its forerunner is that the robots themselves are not sentient, instead their pilots are in charge. This opens up for a long narrative with the different personality types discussing the events they experience. The spiritual power system, while already introduced in the first game, is now available to all pilots. The spiritual commands allow pilots to upgrade their dodging, accuracy, movement or health during one turn, or even to repair other units. Instead of attacking, units can also try to negotiate with the enemy in order to get him or her to change sides. This command is mostly useful to those who have seen the original TV series and therefore know who are supposed to switch sides.[CR]For the first time, SRW 2 features Winkey Soft's original characters, from the Lord of Elemental universe, in addition to those licenced from Gundam (0079, Z, ZZ, F91), Mazinger (Z, Great Mazinger, Grendizer) and Getter Robo (G).</plot>

				<plot>Dai Senryaku is one of those strategic warfare games. It plays alot like Nectaris or Gameboy Wars for Gameboy, so if you played one of those, you know exactly what this one is like.[CR]Anyway, the game is played in a semi-hex grid map, where you move various troops you place along the map, trying to take resources and destroy all of your enemy's units. Of course, placing units costs money, so you have to take over cities or whatnot (I guess they pay you a tribute or someting). If you like strategic warfare, this game is right up your alley![CR]Translation Description:[CR]Well, a translation like this is hard to screw up, and Gideon Zhi does not disappoint.

				<title_clean>Daiva - Imperial of Nirsartia</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Daiva 6: Imperial of Nirsartia is the sixth in a series of seven Daiva games that were all released simultaneously on different platforms. Most of the other versions ended up on Japanese computers such as the PC88, PC98 or MSX. The series is not a collection of sequential stories, but rather a presentation of the same story from the perspectives of seven different protagonists. There was also a separate comic book and other media released around the same time as part of a huge media blitz to promote the games, all based around the galactic civilization Daiva.[CR]All of the Daiva games were developed by T&amp;E Soft, who were perhaps best known at the time for the Hydlide series of action RPG's. Daiva 6 was published by the music giant Toshiba-EMI.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player must explore the planetary systems and take over enemy locations, all the while protecting their own, like in Star Raiders. A big difference, however, is that the player is expected to take over planets manually by dropping down to the planet in a mech. The player can call on three types of support: Missiles, which home-in and eliminate random enemies; bombs, which clear the screen; and a refill item which recovers the player mech's health. The player chooses where to drop these power-ups at which points during the level before actually entering it, thereby requiring some degree of strategic preparation before the assault.[CR]The action stages are all side-scrolling shoot-em-up action levels reminiscent of something like Side Arms or Thexder. The goal is to simply make it to the other end of the stage without losing all the mech's shields and being destroyed. Each stage has a different amount of gravity: On most stages, the mech drops to the bottom and the player can apply a little thrust to make the mech glide and jump over enemies and obstacles. Occasionally, the gravity is so great that the mech is very limited in its vertical movement.[CR]In addition, the game also has strategy elements. It has strategic turn-based battles whenever the player's mothership encounters other spaceships in deep space. The player selects where they want to move/fire and the turn plays out. Though primitive, Daiva 6 has one of the earliest examples of the TBS genre, which would eventually become very popular on the Famicom and other Japanese computers.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 10 Occupied Planets[CR]At the password screen, select the Japanese character on the 3rd Row of the 3rd Column and enter it 12 times. Now hit "End" and you'll get an error message. Just hit enter again to start the game with 10 planets occupied.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]P.O.W. is a scrolling beat 'em-up, allowing simultaneous two-player gameplay. Players control escapees from a POW camp, who have to punch, kick, stab and shoot their way out. This is one of the first scrolling beat 'em-ups to allow players to also use guns to attack enemies. Whilst there is little change in the enemies faced, mostly palette variations of the same 3 types, it does seem to allow more enemies to be on the screen at once.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>De-Block is a puzzle game that can be most easily explained as a 4-way Tetris. The player controls a block in the center of the screen which can move and rotate freely. Larger blocks move inward from each side of the screen and attach to the center block, then change color depending on their distance from the center. If the player completes a colored ring, that layer and all the blocks inside of it are cleared, and all the ones outside are moved inward. Play ends if a newly-appearing block overlaps with the player's structure.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Yuushi he no Tabi ("Journey to the Hero") is the third in Humming Bird Soft's tetralogy of first-person RPGs in the older Wizardry style of dungeon crawler.[CR]One of the new features for the series is the ability to explore multiple dungeons, with different towns at the top of each. The player can also create three additional characters to follow the protagonist and modify them to their liking rather than relying on pre-generated characters found later in the game, though the latter option still exists if the player wishes to exchange them with the ones they generated.[CR]It is the first Deep Dungeon game to be released on NES cartridge, and was not available for the MSX or Famicom Disk System. It, like the rest of the Deep Dungeon series, was never released outside of Japan.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Max Experience[CR]At the main menu, create your save file by selecting the first option. You'll be asked to name it. Afterwards, you'll have 4 options, the first 3 are to create additional characters and the last one is to exit. Create your characters if you wish and then select exit. You'll be back at the main menu again. Now select the 3rd option and you'll be taken to another menu where you'll find the save file you just created. On this screen, hold Left and press Start. Release Left and press Up, Down, A, Select, Left, Start, B, Up &amp; Down. The game will start automatically after the last button press. Now check your status and you'll see that all of your characters have 65,535 experience points![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Dont pick up the Iron Key[CR]You need the Iron Key initially to get to the second town, but once you're at level 7 or 8, the best way to build up is to return to the room where you got the key. Drop the key and step on the fight square. You will face guards and mages that will be very easy. When asked if you want to pick up the key, say no. Then retreat and return. The square only detects if you have the key or not, so you can keep working this fight until you've leveled up. It gives much better gold than most tower fights and good experience, and it's very low risk.</plot>

				<plot>You emerge from a groggy stupor and find your right palm covered with dried blood. Hmmm... no wounds... must be someone else's blood. The pain in your left forearm grabs your attention and you notice a tiny puncture. Is this from some type of injection? Your heart skips a beat as you realize that you can't remember who you are![CR]--From the NES Deja Vu instruction manual.[CR][B]Overview:[/B]:[CR]Deja Vu plays almost just like Shadowgate. It was made by the same people and even used the same engine. Deja Vu is set in a more modern time though. It was pretty cool for a point and click game. It was pretty hard though. They made it where you could do things that would make it virtually impossible to beat the game, which means you had to start all over. Deja Vu is pretty fun, but be careful, or you'll have to start over.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]Solve the mystery of who you are and why you can't remember.[CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]A Button: Make a selection with the pointer. Also used to read the next part of a message.[CR]B Button: Deselect commands.[CR]Start Button: Start the Game[CR]Select Button: Select[CR][B]Hints:[/B][CR]Take Everything[CR]- Be sure to take everything the game will let you, you never know where you are gonna need something.[CR]Reviewer:[CR]Adrian[CR]http://www.consoleclassix.com/nes/deja_vu.html[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Get more coins when broke[CR]No coins?  No problem!  The game prevents you from ever worrying about running out of coins, provided you can make it back to Peoria St. and back to the basement of Joe's Bar in one piece.  Go to the casino with 0 coins, and EXAM the slot machine on the right (the one that works).  You will always find an extra coin sitting in the pan if the game detects you have 0 coins.  Gamble until you get more!</plot>

				<plot>You are Kuros, the knight warrior, hero of the Books of Excalibur. Your journey begins deep within the woods of Elrond, where even the wind obeys the Supreme Wizard, Malkil. A wizard so great, Merlin calls him teacher. But Malkil has strayed from the path, and is now part of the dark side. Buried within the catacombs and dungeons of Elrond lies the key to your quest. The powers of levitation, the cloak of darkness, and the mysterious potions only Kuros can drink will be revealed to you. In caverns of fire, through demons that fly and crawl, against the soldiers of the undead you must continue. No sorcery can prevail, for you are the only knight with the strength to wield the Brightsword. The prisoner of the wizard awaits. She calls to you from Castle IronSpire. But the wizard is watching you, warrior. And this tale has just begun.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Invincibility when fighting a boss[CR]This glitch works when fighting all bosses except the first and the last one. First, when in the stage of a boss, go to the far left of the area. Then, just barely tap the right button so that you just turn around(if you move any except for just turning around, this glitch will not work). Once you have turned around, use the potion of levitation to float. While you are floating in this spot, you will be completely invincible and can attack by using the dagger/axe.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] More Gems[CR]When you get to level two, use the Red Key to enter through the Red Door. Go all the way up and you'll find a gem block. Hit a maximum of five gems out of it and get them. Then go left and fall all the way to the bottom. Go back up and repeat this procedure to get more and more gems.</plot>

				<title_clean>Devil Man</title_clean>
				<plot>You may have heard of Go Nagai if you're into giant robots. He created Mazinger Z. Here's Devilman, another creation by Go Nagai. Devilman isn't a giant robot, rather a giant? demon. But he's a good demon, more or less- he fights other demons for the good of mankind![CR]Well, in this NES game, you get to play as Devilman! Actually, you start off playing as his alterego, Akira Fudo. As Akira you really can't kill anything (in the streets, you pretty much face of against blue gangsters). You first have to find a certain person, who then tells you what you must do to become Devilman. After that, the game gets slightly more interesting. Now, you can kill the demons that are running rampant across the streets, although that won't do you much good if you don't go around collecting information. After some talking, you can end up playing as Miki, Akira's girlfriend. And that's pretty much up to where I got.[CR]The game seems to be more of a detective game in the sense that to get anywhere, you really do need to talk to people and give them the right answer (sometimes, the right answer is kinda? weird- like having to answer that, no, you did not watch TV yet). From where I played, it seems the game is more focused on information collecting rather than fighting enemies. In the streets there's only one type of enemy. That may change in the later levels, though.[CR]Fighting itself is kind of awkward. Not too awkward if you're Devilman, but if you're someone like Akira or Miki, enemies pretty much just fall back and run right back at you. You pretty much have no way of getting anywhere unless you jump over them (although I did fight one mini-boss as Miki and beat him up).[CR]You might need to savestate if you want to get to the ending, unless you like noting down passwords. Also, if you die, the game will let you continue from there automatically (you have select continue first, though).[CR]The game seems pretty fun. Snark's translation is kind of pre-90's in a way. Think something along the lines of the old Final Fantasy minus any apostrophes. Still, the game itself is pretty enjoyable.[CR]To end this, it might be useful to know some controls:[CR] - A - Jump[CR] - B - Punch (or in Miki's case, slap)[CR] - Start - Pause. Here, you can select talk if someone's in the same room you're at, or you can view the password[CR] - Select - Once you've transformed into Devilman once, you can transform back and fro at will by selecting either up (Devilman) or down (Akira) in this menu. Later on, after you're done with Miki, you seem to need to punch demons out as Akira to build more anger so Devilman can fly to the next area.[CR]Usually, characters will be terrified of Devilman and would much rather talk to Akira. Still, it's fun to see their wailing screams as Devilman tries to talk to them.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]Go Nagai's Devilman comes to life in this graphic and text action-adventure game for the Famicom/NES. High atop the Himalayas, ancient devils are stirring beneath the ice after ten thousand years of imprisonment. Archdemon Xenon, their four-faced master unleashes them upon the Earth much to the chagrin of humanity. You are Akira Fudo who combines with a powerful ancient demon named Amon to become Devilman! Six levels of fire, ice, water,secret demon research labs, Tokyo ruins, and much more to explore as Devilman, Akira, his friends, or girlfriend Miki! Four exciting alternate endings! Check the read-me file for the walkthrough and level passwords![CR]Reviewer: Moulinoski [CR]http://romhacking.net/trans/1386/[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Passwords[CR]To enter the password, power-on or reset the NES console and press the Select Button so that the cursor hovers over "Continue". Press the Start Button and you will find the password screen and its various Japanese characters. The passwords below are thusly in a format of - Row #, Column # -. Once you have entered the password, use the lower-rightmost blue phrase to confirm the password entry. Do note, however, that these also store your progress towards the game's endings; hence, there are multiple "Level 6/7" passwords listed - one for each ending, as Level 6 is the "point of no return" for unlocking the endings. Look within the parentheses for which ending.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Story Endings[CR]During the course of the game, you are given the opportunity to rescue Izumi, Miki, and the Makimuras. Rescuing some or all of these characters can trigger different endings - and allow additional levels - in the game. The "bad" ending ends the game at the end of Level 6. The "moderate" ending allows a seventh level. The "best" ending only differs from the "moderate" ending in that it gives a better ending to the storyline as a whole.</plot>

				<title_clean>Devil World</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]History:[/B][CR]Devil World is a maze-based game by Nintendo R&amp;D1 and Intelligent Systems, released in Japan in 1984 and Europe in 1987. It is most notable as the only game produced by Shigeru Miyamoto that was not released in the USA.  Nintendo of America's strict policies on religious imagery denied the game a release as it featured  crosses,  bibles, and  The Devil. It was also the first game designed by  Takashi Tezuka.[CR]The game was developed after  Donkey Kong had hit the market, but before  Super Mario Bros, and has the distinction of being the first original game for the Famicom/NES that Miyamoto worked on.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay is very similar to that of  Pac-Man, but with some additions. The Devil stands on top of the screen and gestures in the direction the screen will be scrolling, and there are walls surrounding the game field. If Tamagon is caught between a wall and a block when the screen scrolls, he will be squashed and die.[CR]The game is played in rounds that have three different stages. The first stage has Tamagon collecting pellets while avoiding enemies, like in Pac Man. But to be able to collect pellets and harm enemies, Tamagon must first find one of the crosses that are scattered through the level, which acts somewhat like a  power pellet, but they can be picked up as many times as needed. With the cross in front of him, he can collect the pellets and spit fire at enemies. The cross only lasts for about 10-15 seconds. Then Tamagon must find a new one.[CR]When killing an enemy, they turn into a floating eye or something which Tamagon can eat for a lot of points. Then they re-appear after a couple of seconds. There is also a mini-devil that appears in some stages who is invulnerable, but he will change direction if shot. Sometimes a couple of ice cream cones will appear which Tamagon can collect for 800 points each. The level will end once a certain amount of the pellets are collected (sometimes there are pellets left to collect when the level ends for some reason.)[CR]In the second stage, Tamagon must take four bibles and plug them into the holes of the red block with a skull on it. He can only spit fire while carrying a bible. The third stage is just a bonus stage where Tamagon collects "Bonus blocks" for extra points. After the bonus stage, the "round" is over, and a new round begins. There are three different rounds with different levels, then the game just repeats and gets faster until you run out of lives.[CR]Appearances[CR]The protagonist, Tamagon, appeared as a trophy in the Japanese version of  Super Smash Bros Melee. The trophy was removed but accessible by Action Replay in the USA version but totally removed in the European version. Tetris DS features a Devil World themed background at level 17.The Devil character appears as a support character in  Super Smash Bros Brawl. Tamagon features as a sticker. PiCTOBiTS on the DS features two levels based on the game as well as two accompanying remixes of the game's music and sfx.[CR]</plot>

If Tamagon is caught between a wall and a block when the screen scrolls, he will be squashed and die.[CR]The game is played in rounds that have three different stages. The first stage has Tamagon collecting pellets while avoiding enemies, like in Pac Man. But to be able to collect pellets and harm enemies, Tamagon must first find one of the crosses that are scattered through the level, which acts somewhat like a  power pellet, but they can be picked up as many times as needed. With the cross in front of him, he can collect the pellets and spit fire at enemies. The cross only lasts for about 10-15 seconds. Then Tamagon must find a new one.[CR]When killing an enemy, they turn into a floating eye or something which Tamagon can eat for a lot of points. Then they re-appear after a couple of seconds. There is also a mini-devil that appears in some stages who is invulnerable, but he will change direction if shot. Sometimes a couple of ice cream cones will appear which Tamagon can collect for 800 points each. The level will end once a certain amount of the pellets are collected (sometimes there are pellets left to collect when the level ends for some reason.)[CR]In the second stage, Tamagon must take four bibles and plug them into the holes of the red block with a skull on it. He can only spit fire while carrying a bible. The third stage is just a bonus stage where Tamagon collects "Bonus blocks" for extra points. After the bonus stage, the "round" is over, and a new round begins. There are three different rounds with different levels, then the game just repeats and gets faster until you run out of lives.[CR]Appearances[CR]The protagonist, Tamagon, appeared as a trophy in the Japanese version of  Super Smash Bros Melee. The trophy was removed but accessible by Action Replay in the USA version but totally removed in the European version. Tetris DS features a Devil World themed background at level 17.The Devil character appears as a support character in  Super Smash Bros Brawl. Tamagon features as a sticker. PiCTOBiTS on the DS features two levels based on the game as well as two accompanying remixes of the game's music and sfx.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Die Hard</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR]Die Hard follows the plot of the film Die Hard very closely. As           John McClane, players can explore several levels of    Nakatomi Plaza. Each level has its own theme, similar to the later   PlayStation game          Die Hard Trilogy - there is an office level, a level where meetings take place (with many tables, like one scene in the film), a rooftop, and even the vault from the film makes it into the game. The game presents the player with an almost  open world experience. For instance, the ultimate goal is to disable the vault so that the Nakatomi Corporation cannot be robbed. Every four minutes, in real time, one of the six locks of the vault is open; theoretically the player only has 24 minutes to finish the game. However, the player can go to the roof and call for help (which is entirely optional), or choose simply to attempt to destroy as many terrorists as possible. Different cinematic sequences are triggered depending on what the player does. In that sense, the game's story is malleable, and does not strictly follow the events of the film.  The game starts the player off with McClane's signature         Beretta M92F. After killing terrorists, the player can pick up sub-machine guns,       grenades and explosives. Health is recovered by drinking cans of      soda or snacks, which can be collected as     loot from terrorists or from vending machines throughout the buildings. C4 and detonators can also be collected and can be used should the player desire to destroy the vault. Once McClane's health runs out completely, the game ends. Movement is eight-way from the top down viewpoint; that is the player can move at right or forty-five degree angles. Bullets are also fired in these directions. There are several interesting mechanics in Die Hard. One mechanic is the foot meter, which measures how worn McClane's feet are. (In the film and in the game, McClane takes off his shoes before the terrorists attack and never has the chance to put footwear on.) Walking over glass or rough surfaces will wear the foot meter away significantly. Once the foot meter reaches the lower levels, McClane's movement speed is significantly impaired. The foot meter can be restored by collecting        medical packs.  The player cannot see what lies in wait in the blacked out areas.  Another mechanic is McClane's line of sight. The player cannot see around walls or through doors or in rooms that McClane is not in. Areas not in the player's field of vision are blacked out. As all action in the game is unscripted, including the appearance of terrorists and their locations in the level, terrorists may often be hiding in dark areas waiting for the player to walk into their line of sight. McClane can use stairs, elevators and ventilation shafts to travel around the building. All the glass windows across the levels are fully breakable, and can be traveled through. As such, the entire world of the game is remarkably fully realized.  As the player progresses further into the game, the terrorists grow savvy to the player's movements. After killing many terrorists, for example, Hans Gruber will order radio silence, making it impossible for the player to be notified of the terrorists' movements.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hidden Continues[CR]If you get yourself killed, wait for the Game Over screen to appear, hold A + B + Down and press Start. If done right, you'll go to a Continue screen where you'll get 2 free continues.</plot>

				<title_clean>Dig Dug</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]  View zoomed image in  gallery for animation.     You play as Dig Dug (who is also known as    Taizo Hori in other games that he appears in), a  pump wielding spelunker who faces several enemies while he digs    underground. The object of each level (or board) is to clear it of all of the enemies before they kill you by walking to within a set distance and pushing the button to fill the up with air until they explode. Another more strategic way to dispatch your enemies would be to dig underneath    boulders that are located on each level and drop them on to to enemies that are below them. It could be argued that this was one of the first major acts of  violence  in a video game, but due to it's cartoon like nature it was probably overlooked at the time. The original game was released into arcades by Namco in 1982, and contained the standard (at the time) of 256 levels before you reached a    "kill screen" and the game either froze up or  reset itself. Another source of scoring points throughout the game is the inclusion of a fruit or item in the center of the screen that would appear after dropping two of the levels boulders. This mechanic is very similar to another Namco game series,    Pac-Man. The boulders did not have to drop on enemies for the fruits to appear however. The bonus items include :    Carrot,  Turnip, Zucchini (or Cucumber),    Eggplant,  Green Pepper,    Tomato,    Garlic,    Watermelon,    Pineapple, as well as the inclusion of a  Warship from Namco's    Galaxian.     [CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]PookaPooka: Best described as a round orange ball with aviator goggles, Pooka is the most common enemy that you will  face in the game. Not as overly aggressive as his counter part, he as well as Fygar still has the ability to pass through  the un-dug parts of the dirt in each level to attack you from any angle.  FygarFygar: A dragon-like creature, not only can he pass through the dirt and attack you but also has the ability to breathe fire, making him a decidedly more difficult and deadly enemy.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Dig-Dug is considered to be a classic and has spawned many    sequels and has appeared on many    compilations and game download services since its initial release. The character of DIg-Dug also has a son named Susumu Hori ( that appears in the    Mr. Driller series), continuing the family legacy of digging to the depths of the earth.  Downloading and playing the demo of the XBLA version unlocks a Gamerpic. [CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Boy version was released in 1993 Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the game scores of 6,6,6, and 5.  They stated, "...the game play is intact and the graphics are decent for GB standards.  A few new features [are] thrown in for a little variety and you have a solid little GB cart that's great for long road trips".[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Digital Devil Story - Megami Tensei</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Title screen.Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei is an occult-themed RPG originally released for the Famicom and the first game in the Megami Tensei franchise. It was developed by Namco's Wolf Team, the same development team that would go on to create Namco's Tales series. The game is based on a novel of the same name by Aya Nishitani. Although the novel is the first part of a trilogy, future games in the series spun off in their own direction, beginning with Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei II.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Akemi Nakajima, one of the game's two protagonists.The game centers on the high school students Akemi Nakajima and Yumiko Shirasagi. Akemi, a computer expert, writes a program capable of summoning demons. However, the demons Loki and Set attacked Akemi upon summoning them. Yumiko, a transfer student, manages to save Akemi with her magic, and the two fight off Loki and Set together. The game proper begins with Lucifer having brought Loki and Set back, intent on taking over the world, and a demonic palace appears in Asuka, the resting place of the goddess Izanami. After Lucifer takes Izanami captive and seals her chamber within the palace, Akemi and Yumiko enter its corridors in order to stop him.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Megami Tensei is explored in first person.Megami Tensei is a dungeon crawler RPG in which the world is viewed from the first-person perspective. Combat is turn-based, with standard RPG combat actions such as physical attacks and magic spells. Yumiko has the ability to use magic, while Akemi is capable of summoning demons using his laptop. This notion would later influence the appearance of demon-summoning devices known as COMPs in later entries in the Megami Tensei franchise. The game does not have a save system, but instead offers passwords. A Game Over occurs if both Yumiko and Akemi die in battle.[CR]Meaning of "Megami Tensei"[CR]Izanagi and Izanami as they appear in the game's ending."Megami Tensei" translates roughly to "Goddess Reincarnation" or "Goddess Transmigration." In context of the game's story, the title refers to Yumiko, who is revealed to be the reincarnation of the Japanese goddess Izanami. The moniker now refers to the Megami Tensei franchise as a whole, including Shin Megami Tensei, the Devil Summoner series, Persona series, and other offshoots.[CR]Demon Compendium[CR]The series' inaugural demon compendium differs in a few key ways from most subsequent entries. Like Megami Tensei II, demons are organized by Evil-Neutral-Good alignments instead of Shin Megami Tensei's Law--Neutral-Chaos and Light-Neutral-Dark systems. Additionally, Evil demons outright cannot join the player's party and there are different rosters of Neutral demon races depending on which ones appear in the field as enemies versus which ones can be fused as allies. Many demon races still currently used in the series make their first appearances here.Evil (Enemy)Demons that only appear as enemies, the Evil class is equivalent to Chaos-aligned and Dark-affinity demon races of Shin Megami Tensei. The Tyrant race consists of the game's bosses.MatterMad SlugPink LooperGreen SlimeWill O'Wisp (Blue)BlobMega PlanarianSlime SludgeWill O'Wisp (Red)Medusa's ShadowSand LooperMyconidPoltergeistA Bao A QuDemon Shrunken HeadFogSpiritZombieGhostSkeletonGhoulIsuma* GhostMummyLaughing SkullHauntPharaohVampireBlack KnightAkhkharuDullahanDiva*Hakuma Budou*Howler/Phantom BeastBasim*BugApepTarantulaTammuzSerpentCockatriceScyllaWilderNueManticoreFenrisOrthrusValeforTyphonGorgonHydraTiamatJakiOrcGargoyleOgreEdimmuCyclopsOniKing TrollFemmeHarpyPharai*ArachneNasuTarakaRangdaNightCaimIncubusSuccubusLoaMephistophelesShadowVileBaalBehemothAstarothZoma*AshuraBeelzebubTyrantMinotaurMedusaLokiHecateSetLuciferNeutral (Enemy and Ally)Demons that can be encountered on the field and added to the player's party, with the exceptions of Dodongo and Purksi of the Beast clan, who can only appear in battles.

The player controls Masamune Date, one of the most talented tacticians among the daimyos of the period.[CR]The game was released around the same time as the NES versions of Hot-B's Takeda Shingen and Koei's Nobunaga's Ambition - each features a different daimyo of the same era as their main protagonist.[CR]Namco sets Dokuganryu Masamune apart with a much more in-depth story to follow, as well as some real-time action battles that the player has some control over.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Don Doko Don</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Don Doko Don is a Japanese action platformer first developed and published for arcades by Taito in 1989. One or two players control bearded dwarves as they make their way through fifty platforming and puzzle-like levels in an attempt to save their kidnapped girlfriend.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] typically consists of basic platforming with puzzle elements, usually stemming from proper use of power-ups and special abilities than can even lead to secret areas. The game consists of five worlds, with ten single-screen levels in each plus a boss at the end. Throughout the levels there are also various enemies which can be dealt with by smashing them with the dwarves' hammer. Enemies squished by the hammer can then be picked up and used as deadly projectiles to take out other foes. Once all enemies have been cleared, the player can then move onto the next level.[CR]Powerups[CR]Power-up items can often appear in the center of stages and give a boost to the player in the form of extra power, speed, weapons, instant death of enemies and a slow-down ability. The amount of power the player has determines how far and powerful they can throw enemies through walls.[CR]Ports and sequels[CR]NES[CR]After the success of the arcade release in 1989, the game was eventually ported over to the Nintendo Entertainment System and TurboGrafx-16 a year later and retained its core gameplay with some minor loss of graphical fidelity.[CR]In 1992, Don Doko Don 2 was released on the Nintendo Entertainment system by Taito in Japan. Unlike the first game, the sequel took the form of a side-scrolling platformer.[CR]In 2006, the game was included in the PC, Xbox and PlayStation 2 compilation Taito Legends 2, making it available to audiences outside of Japan for the first time since its release.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Reverse Rounds[CR]Don Doko Don features a hidden password prompt in the very first level. Above the top most platform, jump and swing your hammer. You will see the outline of an invisible bubble. Keep swinging at this bubble to release a key, this key opens a door to the password prompt.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Don Doko Don 2 is a side-scrolling action platformer developed and published for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Taito on January 31st, 1992 in Japan. Featuring the same dwarf characters as its predecessor, Don Doko Don 2 this time tasks the player to seek out a magic potion that will restore an unlucky groom back to his original human form after being transformed into a frog by some pesky bat.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]While the sequel shares a few traits with the original game such as being able to pick up defeated enemies and throw them into others, Don Doko Don 2 ditches the single-screen format in favour of a more modern side-scrolling approach. As opposed to Don Doko Don's requirement of defeating all enemies in a level to progress, this time players need only reach the door at the end of the level to proceed. Other similarities in gameplay are the behaviour of power-ups and weapons.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Since its release, unofficial hacks of the game have become widely circulated with substituted art assets and retitled Mario 8, or, Super Bros. 8 in the style of the Super Mario series.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Title screen.[CR]Donaldland is a Famicom platformer released only in Japan by Data East in 1987. It stars Ronald McDonald as he attempts to rescue his friends across a number of stages. It is unknown why it was not released elsewhere.[CR]The actual Famicom cartridge of the game is fairly rare and its release also predates the more well-known M.C. Kids.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]When the Gumon Family takes over McDonaldland and captures Ronald's friends including Grimace, Birdie, the Fry Guys, and others, it's up to the jolly clown himself to put an end to their vile machinations and eat hamburgers across numerous locales leading up to the final castle headquarters of the Gumon Family.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]No supersizing available.[CR]Donaldland is a typical NES platformer, with Ronald having the ability to throw apple bombs and also vault himself off of them with the right amount of skill.[CR]Ronald can also power himself up by eating at McDonald's restaurants after every stage of the game. He can buy various McDonald's food items with burger icons he collects in stages, which give him chances to play a bonus minigame to earn extra lives, a bomb doubler, and health.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]HOME TOWN WORLDThe calm in Home Town World.[CR]Mayor McCheese bids Ronald good luck before setting out on his adventure in this once peaceful town run amuck with agents of darkness like crazy cats, crime dons, and jack 'o lanterns. A foul avian creature is the stage's boss, which is the first true test of Ronald's bomb-throwing abilities.LAKE SIDE WORLD[CR]Lake Side World is home to ancient, sentient trees that will wake up and snarl at Ronald should he step on top of them. Surely the cause of their distress is the cannon fire and crying children he must avoid or destroy. A mysterious lizard is the boss.FOREST WORLD[CR]High above in the treetops of McDonaldland, Ronald must choose his steps carefully to avoid plunging to his death in the waiting abyss below. Inchworms and native bushmen don't make his ordeal any less perilous. On top of all of this, he must face a demonic tree face at the end. His reward, however, is the rescue of his friend Birdie.SKY WORLDFire-breathing hell.[CR]Floating amongst the clouds on a big red balloon, Ronald must fight his own mind for fear of being convinced he is in heaven itself. Cherubs, solar gods, and other divine beings want him out of their home, unfortunately for our clown hero. A huge firedrake is the surprising real estate owner of this pleasure paradise.OASIS WORLD[CR]In this desert town sanctuary, Ronald must fight Jawas and birds that poop purple ghosts in the scorching heat. He takes solace in a shady building only to find it inhabited by a reanimated bone wyrm -- and once it is defeated, frees his friends the Fry Guys.CAVE WORLD[CR]Deep underground, Ronald must contend with falling stalactites, overgrown prehistoric insects, and undead skeletons who seem to be more than pleased hurling their skulls to inflict mortal distress upon Ronald's own. It is here that Ronald finds a secret clown funhouse that proves without a doubt the guilt of the Gumon clown criminals. Filled with slippery ice, rare penguins, and ice block hurling social workers, they pale in comparison to the fanged and clawed Demon Grimace that awaits him at the end. His doppelganger defeated, Ronald is able to free the real Grimace from captivity.POND WORLD[CR]Pond World is filled with creatures that have never been seen by any inhabitant of McDonaldland. He must avoid getting eaten alive by humongous alligator-like beasts, cats that seem to like to do nothing but float and dance, and a sentient fanged plant that is their unholy matriarch and primordial goddess.HARBOR WORLDA very poor town layout.[CR]Harbor World was once a bustling port that traded hamburgers across the vast expanse of McDonaldland, but now it is home to pirates and man-eating fish. It is also perhaps the shortest stage Ronald encounters in his journey. A blue-faced clone of Captain Crook fights Ronald at the end.OCEAN WORLDNot the most intelligent of octopi.[CR]In Ocean World, Ronald must hold his breath and swim underwater while avoiding hungry jellyfish and sharks while keeping away from the deadly cannon fire of pirates. Strangely, at the ocean's bottom he finds the wreck of a once worthy sea vessel that is filled with air and home to the legendary Kraken himself. By blowing this tentacled freak into calamari, he is then finally able to save the real Captain Crook from certain morselhood.GHOST TOWN WORLD[CR]No one in McDonaldland knows if Ghost Town World is real or just a spooky illusion. Witches fly overhead in the pale moonlight, sometimes stopping in their broom-riding tracks to merely stare at Ronald without providing any greater obstacle. Two dual spirits of souls long departed try to haunt Ronald away at the stage's finale. Perhaps the scariest of all, after exorcising the souls Officer Big Mac pops out of nowhere and thanks Ronald for being rescued.DARK FOREST WORLD[CR]Dark Forest World is located on the border of the Gumon Family's headquarters. Crying women and smiling bubbles are an eerie reminder of the greater evil within. The final guardian that stands between Ronald and his ultimate goal is a huge melted face that represents the warping effects of the choatic mindset.CASTLE WORLD[CR]Ronald's final showdown takes place in this satanic castle full of the undead. He must battle previous bosses including the dual spirits and the bone wyrm before squaring off against the Shadow Id of the Hamburglar and ultimately, the head of the Gumon clown crime syndicate.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Select[CR]At the first title screen, press A, B, Right, Left and one of the following combinations:</plot>

				<title_clean>Donkey Kong</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The First Level[CR]The arcade classic Donkey Kong rose out of Nintendo's desire to crack into the United States arcade market. The company's president back in 1981, Hiroshi Yamauchi, made the decision to take a Nintendo arcade release called Radar Scope (a hit game in Japan that floundered in the States) and see if it could be easily retrofitted to play a different, and hopefully more successful, game. To accomplish this task, Yamauchi chose a young employee named Shigeru Miyamoto.[CR]Upon going to work, Miyamoto's first attempt was to make a game based on the then-popular Popeye character. The licensing deal was not pursued by Nintendo, though the company would later secure the license and develop a popular Popeye arcade game. Miyamoto had to retrofit his concept and develop three characters with similar relations to Popeye, Olive Oyl, and Bluto. He came up with a little man with a mustache that was quickly named Jumpman, who had to save his girlfriend, Pauline, from the evil gorilla named Donkey Kong.The Second Level[CR]The basic story of the game is that Donkey Kong is Jumpman's pet. Jumpman mistreats Donkey Kong, who snaps and kidnaps Pauline and, in a decidedly King Kong-like twist, takes her up a building under construction. Jumpman must navigate four different levels, climbing to the top to either force Donkey Kong to move on or, in the stunning final confrontation, bring the building's girders down to make the big monkey fall.[CR]Donkey Kong was followed-up by Donkey Kong Jr. , which puts the player in the role of Donkey Kong's son, Donkey Kong Jr., who must attempt to rescue his father from the clutches of the evil Jumpman, who by then had already been renamed Mario.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The Final Level[CR]Donkey Kong helped to create the platformer genre, and also was one of the first to include a story. Donkey Kong changed the way people played games; no longer was it just about high scores, gamers began to play the game to find out what would happen next. Donkey Kong became one of the most iconic video games of all-time and a huge part of American pop culture, gaining mentions on countless television shows, songs, and movies. Donkey Kong also essentially launched Nintendo's biggest character of all-time, Mario.[CR]As a testament to the legacy of Donkey Kong, the documetary King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters was released in 2007, 26 years after the game's debut. The film was about gamer Steve Wiebe and his journey to defeat Billy Mitchell's high score, which had stood for 25 years. Public awareness about the competition for this score was raised by this film, and in the years since Wiebe, Mitchell, and others have traded positions on the top spot. Read more about the documentary at the official site.[CR]In July 2009, Donkey Kong made news yet again when a 26-year-old easter egg, which did nothing more than display the initials of Landon M. Dyer, who worked to code the title, was uncovered after Dyer mentioned that he had forgotten how to display the initials and offered $75 to whomever can find the Easter egg first. The $75 was awarded to Don Hodges after he dug through the game's code and found the way to display the initials.[CR]Donkey Kong: Original Edition[CR]In 2010, a special version of the NES release of Donkey Kong was available to those in Europe who purchased the special Super Mario Bros. 25th anniversary Wii. This version, subtitled "Original Edition", restored the missing "pie factory" stage as well as some animations. Although still not arcade-perfect, it was still much more than any edition released on the NES.[CR]This edition of the game would not release in Japan or the United States until 2012, and only then, on the 3DS. In Japan, it was a pre-order bonus for New Super Mario Bros. 2. In The States, it is a bonus gift for players that purchase the digital download versions of Art Academy: Lessons For Everyone!, Paper Mario: Sticker Star, Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask, Style Savvy: Trendsetters, or Crosswords Plus before January 6, 2013. It was made available to everyone for purchase on the European 3DS eShop on September 18, 2014.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The name comes from a mistranslation of the Japanese, which roughly translates to &#8220;Stubborn Monkey&#8221; . When translating for stubborn the translator(s) came up with &#8220;ass&#8221; or &#8220;donkey,&#8221; and monkey translated to &#8220;King Kong,&#8221; thus Donkey Kong.[CR]The first console port was licensed by Nintendo but not made by them. A near perfect arcade port, and pack-in, was created for the ColecoVision system. This propelled its sales over the Atari 5200 and sold 500,000 units at launch. Over a year later Coleco made a version for its rival's Atari 2600. Sega was also planning to release a version with Coleco.[CR]Falcon was licensed to distribute the game in Europe, which it did so with modified graphics and the name "Crazy Kong" (this is often mistaken to be a bootleg game). They did the same with the sequel Donkey Kong Junior, as Crazy Kong Jr./Crazy Junior.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Gain multiple points faster[CR]Gain multiple points faster[CR]Normally you would gain 100 points each time you jump over a barrel.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The title screen to Donkey Kong 3.[CR]In Donkey Kong 3 the player controls a man named Stanley who is trying to defeat Donkey Kong. Stanley is a bugman who is protecting his green house from Donkey Kong, who is stirring up the bugs creating them to attack Stanley and steal his precious flowers. Stanley starts off equipped with a Bee Smoker but can upgrade to a super can later on. The whole game is based around Donkey Kong disrupting a hive of bees while Stanley tries to defeat Kong by repeatedly hitting him till he retreats and repeating the process till the last level. The player can lose the game three different ways: They can get hit by a bee or another object; they can ignore Donkey Kong for too long he will jump down and deal with Stanley personally; or they can let the bees steal all of the flowers.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Stanley tries to knock Donkey Kong down.[CR]Donkey Kong 1 and 2 had a very specific platformer gameplay mechanic and technique whereas the third Donkey Kong 3 has a change in gameplay, becoming more like a shooter. The game is a simple shooter which borrows many ideas and concept from an older game called Space Firebird. The whole game only consists of three different levels which makes the long term goal to protect the flowers from the enemy. Throughout these levels though are a fair amount of varied enemies. Attempting to deter Stanley are Buzzbee, Beespy, Queen Bee, Creepy The Snake, Buttifly, Stag Beetle, Moth, and Beebomb. Stanley (the protagonist and person the player controls) resembles the famous Mario by wearing suspenders, which are in this case blue. Stanley must protect his flowers from these insects as they try to steal and destroy them. While this is happening Donkey Kong hangs from two vines and aggravates the insects' hives and if not taken care of will come down and attack Stanley personally making the player lose a life. Stanley must use his bug spray to shoot the insects and shoot Donkey Kong to make him climb higher. The level is complete once Donkey Kong climbs to the top of the screen, or every insect is destroyed. Higher up on the vine is a power up that Donkey Kong will drop down once he reaches it. This power up upgrades the bug spray to Super Spray which shoots much faster, does not have a limited range, and destroys all insects in its path. Shooting Super Spray is the only way to destroy Creepy The Snake, who is only temporarily frozen by the standard bug spray. The levels just repeat until the game is reset or the player runs out of flowers to defend.[CR][B]History:[/B][CR]Donkey Kong 3 was originally a 1980s arcade games much like the other Donkey Kong games. It was later on ported to the NES, and GBA later on. The game is now available on the Wii Shop. The original game was released on the NES in 1986, and the emulated version on the Wii was released July 14, 2008 in North America and in Europe January 9th, 2009. The Donkey Kong series prior to 3 were known for dodging objects while platforming up the screen. This Donkey Kong took a different turn and turned itself into a "fixed shooter."[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Mario has kidnapped Junior's Papa![CR]Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong. In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage. As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.[CR]Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior. Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes. The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.[CR]Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes. However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.[CR]In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot. Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.[CR]Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.[CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]A Button: Jump[CR]B Button: Nothing[CR]Start Button: Pause[CR]Select Button: Change Modes[CR][B]Hints:[/B][CR]High Score[CR]- If you want a really high score, jump over enemies every chance you get.

				<title_clean>Doraemon</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Doraemon, based on the manga and anime of the same name, is a sci-fi adventure game where a robotic cat is sent back in time by its young master to help improve the fortunes of his master's distant ancestors. Doraemon has various futuristic gadgets at his disposal, but they're often used irresponsibly by Nobita, the boy Doraemon was sent back to assist.[CR]In the game, Doraemon is trying to rescue his human friends. He travels across three distinct worlds to track down those who kidnapped them. Each world was created by a separate designer and contains a different type of gameplay: The first is a Zelda-like top-down action-adventure game where Doraemon must deduce the correct path to the boss by travelling a large overworld and uncovering hidden tunnels and doors to smaller areas containing useful items. The second is a side- and vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up where Doraemon must navigate through the enemy's stronghold. The third and final stage is an aquatic side-scrolling platformer.[CR]Though hugely popular in Japan at the time, due largely to the license, Doraemon was never localized into English. There is very little text in the game, however, so it is quite playable for non-Japanese speakers.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue the Game[CR]At the Game Over screen:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Invulnerability[CR]In World 1, kill enemies this order: two KOBUN's (red man with black hat), NAME (caterpillar), GOZURA (creature with tube instead of nose), YUBOU (UFO), and another KOBUN. A new prize appears - it will give you invulnerability for 15 seconds.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Doraemon, based on the manga and anime of the same name, is a sci-fi adventure game where a robotic cat is sent back in time by its young master to help improve the fortunes of his master's distant ancestors. Doraemon has various futuristic gadgets at his disposal, but they're often used irresponsibly by Nobita, the boy Doraemon was sent back to assist.[CR]In the game, Doraemon is trying to rescue his human friends. He travels across three distinct worlds to track down those who kidnapped them. Each world was created by a separate designer and contains a different type of gameplay: The first is a Zelda-like top-down action-adventure game where Doraemon must deduce the correct path to the boss by travelling a large overworld and uncovering hidden tunnels and doors to smaller areas containing useful items. The second is a side- and vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up where Doraemon must navigate through the enemy's stronghold. The third and final stage is an aquatic side-scrolling platformer.[CR]Though hugely popular in Japan at the time, due largely to the license, Doraemon was never localized into English. There is very little text in the game, however, so it is quite playable for non-Japanese speakers.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue the Game[CR]At the Game Over screen:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Invulnerability[CR]In World 1, kill enemies this order: two KOBUN's (red man with black hat), NAME (caterpillar), GOZURA (creature with tube instead of nose), YUBOU (UFO), and another KOBUN. A new prize appears - it will give you invulnerability for 15 seconds.</plot>

				<plot>The player takes control of martial artist Billy Lee, or his twin brother Jimmy (also known as Hammer and Spike in the supplementary materials for the American arcade release), as they fight their way into the turf of the Black Warriors gang in order to rescue their common love interest Marian. The player character has a repertoire of martial art techniques which they can perform by using the joystick and three action buttons (kick, jump, and punch) individually or in combination. Techniques ranges from basic punches and kicks, to more elaborate maneuvers like hair grabbing moves or elbow punches. When playing with another player, one can assist the other by grabbing their partner's opponent from behind. The player begins the game with a certain number of extra lives and a life gauge which depletes as the player takes hits from enemies. If the life gauge runs out or the time limit reaches zero, the player will lose a life.[CR]There is a small variety of enemy characters that the player will face thorough the course of the game. Certain enemies will carry a melee weapon which the player can use by disarming the enemy carrying it and then retrieving the item from the floor. The available weapons includes steel bats, whips, throwing knives, and dynamite sticks, as well as large objects such as cardboard boxes, oil drums, and rocks, which the player can lift and throw at enemies or kick it towards incoming ones.[CR]The game is divided into four different stages or "missions", which consist of a city slum, a factory, the woods, and the hideout of the boss. The game normally ends if a single player defeats the final boss alone. However, if two players manage to complete the game together then the two will be forced to fight each other in order to determine who will win Marian's affections.</plot>

				<plot>Another day at Nekketsu High, another gang tournament... but this time its different! A wealthy school principal has placed a challenge for all the school gangs to compete in a special obstacle course composed of 4 different challenges that you and your team must overcome. First in line is a race across the city streets (and rooftops), next is an obstacle course filled with dangerous hazards, then a jumping challenge in which you have to break a series of metal balls, and finally an all-out fighting tournament.[CR]The game uses the same engine and basic gameplay mechanics featured in other Nekketsu High games, with the only change being the goals you must complete to clear each stage. Seeing as how the characters are gang members, fighting and beating your opponents can be a viable way of winning the challenges, so several weapons and power-ups can also be found in the courses[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Maximize Points[CR]Whenever you are in a screen with weapons and a wall, pick up the weapon, throw it into the wall so it bounces and lands on your feet, then pick up again and repeat the process until you maximize your points and easily win the championship.</plot>

When the low health player dies, as long as the other character is out of the screen waiting to go to the next area, he will retain all his money.

The other major difference to River City is that the game allows you to freely explore it in a non-linear fashion, albeit, this can get a bit confusing. Like most brawlers you can also have another player join in on your quest, but the added benefit here is that if you're flying solo the AI will take control of the extra character. You can also switch your partner around as you recruit new allies.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dragon Ball: Daimaou Fukkatsu is a NES Bandai license developed by TOSE and the second from that developer/publisher team to adapt Akira Toriyama's internationally popular Dragon Ball series as a video game, the first being Dragon Ball: Shenlong no Nazo (known in the west as Dragon Power). Specifically, this game covers the first generation of Dragon Ball, where Goku is still a child and the Saiyans have not yet entered the picture. Daimaou Fukkatsu roughly means "Demon King's Revival" and refers to Piccolo, then still the chief antagonist.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is a hybrid adventure/RPG, where Goku must solve various puzzles in order to proceed and also fight foes in an RPG-style combat system. The combat system uses cards to decide attacks; Daimaou Fukkatsu being one of the earliest RPGs to use this system.[CR]Cards also factor into the overworld movement too, as Goku moves along a board game-like path and can only travel a set number of squares decided by using one of his cards. Since high-numbered cards are also integral to winning fights, the player must be cautious about moving too quickly across the world lest they run out of powerful cards for the combat.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] In Front of The Last Castle[CR]At the password screen, enter the following Japanese characters.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dragon Power is an action-adventure game developed and published by Bandai for the Nintendo Entertainment System on March 3, 1988. It is a heavily localized version of the Japanese game Dragon Ball: Shenron no Nazo (translated to Dragon Ball: Mystery of the Dragon God), originally released on November 27, 1986. Although some of the European releases retain the Dragon Ball assets (under the title Dragon Ball), the North American release removes most references to the franchise.[CR]The game follows the first two volumes of the Dragon Ball manga, as the young monkey-tailed boy Goku (along with his teenage friend, Bulma, known in the North American version as Nora), embark on a quest to find all seven Dragon Balls (Crystal Balls in the NA version), in which it is believed that collecting them grants the user any wish they desire. Along the way, they encounter various characters, including turtle hermit Master Roshi (Hermit in the NA version), shapeshifting anthropomorphic pig Oolong (Pudgy in the NA version), and desert bandit Yamcha (Lancer in the NA version).Release History[CR]Dragon Ball: Shenron no Nazo was the first Dragon Ball game for the Famicom, and was released in late 1986. The heavily edited western version, Dragon Power, came out almost two years later.[CR]The Japanese version of Dragon Ball Origins 2, released in 2010, has Shenron no Nazo as a bonus on the cartridge; other releases of the game did not include the game. J Legend Retsuden, released in 2013, included Shenron no Nazo as part of the compilation.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Skip (European Version Only)[CR]Press the B button on controller 2 to skip stages.</plot>

As Son Goku refuses, a battle takes place, and the defeated Radditz threatens to harm Son Goku's son, Son Gohan. Many friends come to help Son Goku, and even his rival Piccolo joins forces with him. But the quest leads them much further - to the ultimate battle against the leader of Saiyajin...[CR]In this fighting/RPG game, you control multiple characters from the series: Son Goku, Piccolo, Krillin, Yamcha, Tienshinhan, Chao-Zu, and Son Gohan. You have to train each character by taking him to battles. All the movements in the game, in battle as well as on the field, occur by collecting and choosing cards of various strength. You move around by selecting a card, and can advance a certain amount of fields depending on its value. You train characters in special training stations before taking them to fights. Once you have trained your character and chose the cards, the battles flow automatically, as cinematic sequences that show Son Goku and his foes exchanging blows while flying.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Strongest Tournament Password[CR]At the password screen, enter the following Japanese characters.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]An early 1984 arcade platformer with action RPG elements, Dragon Buster is notable as the first game to feature a double jump. It was also the earliest known game to include a life meter, known as vitality in this game. The game featured side-scrolling platform gameplay and a hub "world view" map similar to the later Super Mario Bros. series.[CR]Dragon Buster was developed and published by Namco. The game is a side-scrolling dungeon crawler, where the goal of the game is for the hero, Clovis, to rescue Princess Celia. Dragon Buster was later ported to a variety of home consoles, notably the Nintendo Entertainment System and the MSX.[CR]Dragon Buster has also been included in Namco Museum Vol. 2, Namco Museum: Virtual Arcade, Namco Museum: Battle Collection, as well as an extra in Tales of the Abyss.[CR]The game later received a PlayStation exclusive sequel, titled Dragon Valor. The first chapter of Dragon Valor is essentially a remake of Dragon Buster, making Dragon Valor a requel.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Second Quest[CR]Enter at the title screen.  You'll know the code was entered properly if the background color of the map is red instead of green.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The main hero named Carl is a dragon slayer who wields a bow and arrow. He has to pass 6 stages and reach the Dragon Castle to retrieve the sword which the hero of the original Dragon Buster, Clovis, used as a weapon.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Each of the stages has its own dragon castle and the last stage has two, including the ultimate castle, where the main villain keeps the legendary sword. To reach the dragon castle on each of 6 maps, the player has to make his way through different locations, more or less free to chose his route. At the start of each map, the player is presented with a screen that shows which useful items can each type of locations contain. Upon entering a location (using the 'SELECT' button) the view changes to an overhead camera.[CR]The player then has two tasks: find a key dropped by monsters and locate an exit (sometimes dropped by monsters too, leading to some levels having multiple exits). Finished locations disappear from the game map, freeing the way for the hero. The game also uses password system.[CR]Unlike the original game, in Dragon Buster II the protagonist can't use any forms of magic, having only his bow to dispose of enemies, most of which usually take about two shots. The game also features interesting mechanics of showing player's hit points - when Carl is damaged, his shirt color gradually changes (blue -&amp;gt; green -&amp;gt; yellow -&amp;gt; red). Health is replenished via special healing pools and power-ups (fairies). It is also replenished at the start of each location.[CR]The world map is comprised of several "instance" dungeons with semi-randomized layouts that the player must find the most efficient path through - once complete, the dungeon vanishes from the map and the player can progress towards the goal.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]An interesting mechanic of arrows ricocheting off the walls can result in the hero actually shooting himself with a bow.[CR]The game has a few similarities to the Intellivision game Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (sometimes known as AD&amp;D: Cloudy Mountain, which in turn is based somewhat on Hunt the Wumpus), which also featured a lone hero stalking around a dark maze that lights up with further exploration, using the sounds of distant monsters to figure out where they were lurking.[CR]</plot>

As Blade or Striker, a.k.a. the BAD DUDES, you take to the streets to rescue the President. But the Dragon Ninja is ready for you. He sends wave after wave of relentless ninja, vicious dogs, and enemies to stop you. Armed with knives, shurikens and nunchucks, you must fight tooth and nail - in alleys, on waterways, even on moving semi-trucks. In the end... if you're BAD enough... you take on the Dragon Ninja himself. You must defeat him and snatch the President from the helicopter that's about to whisk him away to who-knows-where. It'll take every skill you've ever mastered - and a few new ones - to be BAD![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 63 Extra Lives[CR]When you are at the title screen, press: [CR]B, A, Down, Up, Down, Up simultaneously on the 2nd controller.

Your mother has raised you to be a brave lad and you must now carry on your father's legacy. He was a legendary warrior of Aliahan, who suffered death at the hands of a fiendish monster. 'If not stopped, the Archfiend Baramos will certainly destroy our world', the King says. Your challenge, your destiny - the Destruction of Baramos. With three allies of your choosing, you are set to embark on your quest to save the world from Baramos...your final enemy?* 8 Classes of characters to select from: Hero, Soldier, Pilgrim, Wizard, Fighter, Merchant, Sage, and Goof-Off.* Change classes of your characters mid-game.* Main story contains dozens of intricate subplots. * Travel day and night.* Gamble on monster battles at the Fight Rings.* Select from an expanded arsenal of weapons, armor and spells.* Visit over 40 castles, towns, villages and shrines.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] No Random Encounters (Japanese PRG1 Only)[CR]This cheat is only allowed in Japanese, PRG1 versions of the game. (If you are unsure of your game version, simply try this and see if it works - if not, your game is a PRG0 version.) Hold the A Button on Controller 2 on the world map and, whilst the button is held, no random encounters will be fought.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Cheat in the Monster Arena[CR]You need the Silver Harp for this, which you find in the back of the shrine in Northwest Alefgard.  Take the harp to any fight arena, and use it.  Then talk to the ticket seller.  You'll notice one of the monsters in the roster shows up as a blank spot.  That one will NOT participate in the fight. [CR]Bet on the monster RIGHT ABOVE the one you think will win.  You will win with the monster below the one you bet on wins, and you win with the that monster's odds. [CR]For example, say it's the Magician/Spiked Hare/Magician fight.  After using the harp, it shows up as [BLANK]/Spiked Hare/Magician.  If you bet on the Spiked Hare and Magician B wins, you win, with a payback based on Spiked Hare's odds. [CR]You can really clean up on the Bomb Crag/Man Eater Chest fight.  Bet on the Bomb Crag, Man Eater Chest will automatically win, and for a 300 GP bet (level 30), you will win over 60,000 GP!</plot>

Go through the tunnel and up the stairs on the other side. Re-enter the tunnel, and go up the stairs on the other side. Keep doing this and eventually you'll get 2000 free coins to use in the casino! But you can only do this trick once, I think.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Change Overworld music[CR]In Chapter V, after you have found all seven chosen ones (Ragnar, Alena, Brey, Cristo, Taloon, Nara, and Mara), you can change the music on the overworld.  Place Ragnar at the lead of the party if you want Chapter I music, place Alena, Brey, or Cristo for Chapter II music, Taloon for Chapter III, Nara or Mara for Chapter IV, and the Hero for all-new music.  If you want the Hero's old music, set him/her at the head of the party with no one else in it.</plot>

				<title_clean>Dragon Wars</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR]Introduction[CR]From the back of the box:The designers of the Bard's Tale series, Wasteland, and Battle Chess pooled their talents to create the ultimate role-playing fantasy. They knew it had to be a first-rate story with sophisticated graphics. The result was Dragon Wars.Sailing across uncharted seas, you and your party are in search of a legendary paradise called Dilmun - a place where the streets are paved with gold and no one wants for anything.However, King Drake of Phoebus has declared all magic illegal - magickers have been slain or fled into exile. In retaliation, enemy islands have threatened to unleash their guardian dragons, the most destructive force in the world. While docked at a harbor in Dilmun, you are arrested on suspicion of spellcasting.Imprisoned and stripped of everything but your wits, you are sentenced to a life in a cesspool called Purgatory. Magic is your only salvation - a worldly possesion in a world possessed.[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]   Dragon Wars was the third game released under Interplay Productions' own label outside of EA. It was developed by many of the same people involved with  the Bard's Tale and  Wasteland and as a result, shares many concepts and ideas from those titles within its design. It is also considered the spiritual successor to the Bard's Tale series, even so far as being referred to by some accounts as Bard's Tale IV, but because EA owned the rights to the name, Interplay had to create a new world from scratch. The box also featured art from artist Boris Vallejo with a poster copy inside and there were many references to Sumerian mythology within the game.The game casts the player along with their party as prisoner exiles amidst the slums of the city of Purgatory. Originally on a pilgrimage to the land of Dilmun, the ship they were traveling on was immediately placed under arrest by the city when it came into port. The player and their party are among the lucky few not to be consigned as sacrifices to the dragons, but they are stripped of everything other than the rags on their backs and dumped into Purgatory's streets to survive on their own wits. It is up to the player to somehow find a way to survive and escape Purgatory and eventually seek revenge against Namtar, the Beast From The Pit, who seeks to dominate the world of Oceana.In the world of Dragon Wars, dragons are considered as a form of nuclear deterrence albeit with a fantasy flavor. City-states scattered across the island nations of Oceana each have a dragon within their walls, kept under lock and key and fed well to protect their city from all rivals. A sort of "Cold War" exists where the dragons are held back and to be used only as the final option in war. Part of the mystery is why the city-states haven't yet used their dragons to strike back at Namtar's aggression as a united front.Many of the gameplay systems are a hybrid of ideas from both Wasteland and the Bard's Tale. For example, while the game uses the ranged attack system present in both titles, it does not use classes and instead relies on the skill system first used by Interplay in Wasteland. The automapping feature used in titles such as  Bard's Tale III was also included. The game also uses  the grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90&#176; turns and movement spaces similar to the Bard's Tale series with a few cosmetic differences. Within the ever-present interface, on the upper left quadrant of the screen displayed the world with the party listed to the right along with any encounter messages and options. A text box on the bottom quadrant of the screen would display messages such as combat results. Random enemy encounters would provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes. Hit and spell points are represented by bars instead of numbers.Copy protection took the form of a series of paragraphs that served as descriptors for various areas within the game proper. When prompted, the player was asked to read the appropriate paragraph for the required information. This method had also been used in Wasteland.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]   The game challenged players immediately from the start. After character creation was completed and a party assembled, the player was tested to find a way to survive as they would start the game with nothing in their inventory.As with most RPGs of this type, party setup and character selection were left entirely up to the player. If the player so chose to create a party of warriors, they could expect extreme difficulty ahead without a mage to help teleport them back home, out of a dungeon, or heal them adequately in combat. A party is limited to seven characters, although the manual suggests leaving one slot open for summoned monsters or special encounters that may join the party.Characters could be imported from any of the three games in the Bard's Tale series which would give them an advantage in statistics early on.As noted earlier, it is suggested that players do so in order to survive the initial encounters, or grind the first dungeon until they are able to hold their own in combat. It will only get worse from there. However, there are a variety of exploits that can dramatically level parties up with experience early on in the game. RacesDragon Wars did not feature any races within the game to choose from for character creation. Everyone on Oceana was human.Death was also somewhat permanent and there were no listed spells within the manual that could perform resurrection.  Characters   Parties consist of seven characters. Players can only create four characters of their own and  the last three slots are reserved for NPCs that can be hired into the group as they are encountered in the adventure. Unlike the Bard's Tale or Wasteland, however, there is no Adventurer's Guild or HQ for players to swap out characters or create new ones on the fly. Once a party was created, the only way to create a new character would be to start the game over.During character creation, the player can determine their name, sex, and then distribute fifty character points to improve their statistics and purchase skills. Statistics in Dragon Wars are not rolled during creation. Every character starts out with a ten in every attribute and further changes are made using the points that they are given. StatisticsDuring creation, the player is given the chance to adjust the starting statistics for their character. While playing the game, a character's profile could be viewed by simply hitting an appropriate number key to show a character's abbreviated statistics along with various other pieces of information. The abbreviated value for how these attributes appear onscreen are listed in parenthesis.Strength (STR): Ideal for fighters as well as for performing physical tasks. Weapons in the game have a particular strength requirement and anything over that limit translates into additional damage. Intelligence (INT): As with most RPGs, it's an important attribute for potential spellcasters and for solving puzzles that require a high INT score. It also determines whether a spell will hit its opponent. Dexterity (DEX): Helps in hitting opponents along with avoiding incoming blows. It also determines who goes first in combat making it essential for fighters. Spirit (SPR): This is important for spellcasters and determines how many power points magic users have at their disposal. Power (POW): This represents the current number of points that a spellcaster has at their disposal. These do not regenerate naturally requiring the player to find alternate means of recharging their mages such as using a Dragonstone or other source. Health: When reduced to zero, the character dies. It can only be restored through the use of magic, finding a healer, or using the bandage skill. Stun: Characters will typically run out of this first before they run out of health. When reduced to zero, they fall unconscious and are unable to fight but they aren't dead. This regenerates automatically after combat. Sex: As the manual states, male, female, sometimes, or never. Experience: This measures how many points must be earned until the next level. Level progression in Dragon Wars is particularly slow making character development and the distribution of points extremely important to consider in the long term. Level: When a level is earned, a character gains two points with which to spend on attributes or skills. Armor Class (AC): This more directly shows the quality of your armor versus the chance that an enemy blow has to connect. The better, or higher, this value is, the less damage a character's health or stun levels will receive.  Attack Value (AV) &amp; Defense Value (DV): These are based on a character's dexterity divided by four and are the basic statistics governing combat. These determine how often you hit in combat and how often a character receives the same treatment. Heavier armor may improve your armor class, but it may drive down your defense value because of its weight.   SkillsThese determine how well your characters will survive the game with a variety of fields that can help them. Because of the slow rate of character development and the low number of skill points given to each character when they level, character specialists are increasingly important to consider when building your party. Although Wasteland uses a skill system, the one in Dragon Wars is not dependent on the intelligence level of any particular character. Having the right number of character points is all that is needed. The skills available to characters are:Bandage: This is the healing ability of a character. The greater this skill, the more health is restored. Cave Lore:  May reveal hidden pieces of information during the exploration of underground places. Climb: This skill is used to climb over rocks, into trees, and down to certain doom. Having a high climb skill is necessary in several places. Forest Lore: Operates in the same way as Cave Lore by providing certain pieces of information to characters that have this. Hiding: Useful for hiding from potential enemy encounters. Useless once combat begins. Tracker: Allows the character to track various creatures by the trail they leave behind. Lockpick: Allows a characer to get into places where they aren't invited. Extremely useful and the manual suggests that it is an important skill to have in resolving your quest. Magic Skills: Characters hoping to learn magic must first learn the LOW MAGIC discipline before they can access any of the othres. The higher one's expertise is in a particular discipline, the better of a chance they will have for their spells to hit their target. Mountain Lore: Similar to Cave and Forest Lore skills, can reveal hidden secrets while traveling amidst the mountains. Fistfighting: Determines how well a character can fight with their hands. Arcane Lore: A mage with both magical ability and knowledge is a well rounded character. The skill helps with matters pertaining to magic. Bureaucracy: This determines how charismatic a character can be in trying to get their way. Swim: Can help with water hazards but not for swimming in between the islands of Dilmun. Town Lore: Helps by revealing certain pieces of legend and lore concerning a town the party may be visiting. Pickpocket: Allows a character to borrow a few coins from unsuspecting NPCs. Weapon Skills: Weapon use is not determined by having the skill to use it, although investing points into the appropriate category will improve a character's ability to use it.  As in Wasteland, characters can use any of their skills in order to solve puzzles or on certain NPCs. Magic   With the restrictions on magic in the world of Dragon Wars, being a magic user comes at a high price. Namtar, the main antagonist of the story, has become the most powerful sorceror of Dilmun by manipulating King Drake to declare his ban on magic. With no other opposition, Namtar is free to monopolize his power and has already acted. The other city-states took to warfare to defy King Drake's decree, losing their spellcasters in the opening stages of the war. Namtar's Stosstrupen, a sort of magical secret police, had also worked to assassinate Dilmun's top sorcerors before they could organize an effective resistance. It is the player's task to recover this magical knowledge and use it against Namtar before he can move ahead with his plans to conquer what is left.Learning a spell in Dragon Wars requires finding a scroll with the appropriate knowledge and then using it, causing it to vanish forever. Because most of those that even knew of how to teach magic are dead, in hiding, or worse, discovering any piece of magic is one of the challenges.Low Magic is initially available as a skill purchase to new characters, but the disciplines of High, Sun, and Druid magic must be learned from their respective masters.There are four major spell classes:Low Magic: Weak, widespread, and of little threat, Namtar has done little to purge this discipline. Purgatory still maintains a working Low Magic shop as a result. High Magic: The acknowledged master of High Magic was the Stosstrupen's first target. He was turned to stone and then smashed. With his demise, the practice of High Magic had all but ended. High magic has a number of powerful spells for combat, healing, and even summoning purposes but characters will need to find someone who can teach them. It cannot be chosen at the start of the game. Sun Magic: Oddly enough, Sun Magic remains public and legal and the master of this art lives in Phoebus at the Temple of the Sun. It has the most potent offensive spells in the game. Characters will need to meet with Mystalvision, the master of Sun Magic and a public hero, to learn how to use this discipline. As with High Magic, it cannot be learned during character creation. Druid Magic: The "purest" discipline focused on nature, it has a number of useful utility spells that allow passge through stone walls as well as potent healing. Finding someone who will be able to teach characters is easier said than done. As with High and Sun Magic, Druid magic cannot be chosen at the start of the game.  [CR]Encounters and Combat[CR]   When the party encounters a random enemy, a descriptive list is given at the start. Any group of monsters within 10' (feet) of your party are within melee range. Some monsters, however, will also use ranged attacks. Combat is divided into a series of rounds and it is up to the player to decide what they should do next.The player's options during such an encounter are are:Fight: Initiates combat with the typical options. Quickly Fight: This initiates combat but with fewer options than Fight in order to quickly resolve the encounter. Run: The party will attempt to flee. Advance Ahead: Moves the party closer to a ranged encounter to narrow the distance.  If the Fight option is chosen, melee character will have the option of striking a normal blow (as in Quick Fight), a mighty blow (reduced hitting chance but greater damage), or a disarm which will deal some damage but attempt to knock an enemy's weapon away. Players will also be able to rearrange their party. They will also be able to block when this option is used.Under both types of fighting options, players will always be able to use an item, run like a coward, dodge an attack, or cast a spell. If players run from combat, the computer will randomly run the party across the map. This can sometimes place them in a far more dangerous area than the one they had just left.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Dragon's Lair</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dirk the Daring's fluid animation and unparalleled visual detail helped make Dragon's Lair a hit.[CR]Dragon's Lair was first released as a Laserdisc arcade game in 1983 by Cinematronics, featuring artwork created by former Disney animator Don Bluth. Because of the relatively large storage capacity of the laserdisc, Cinematronics were able to create a game that featured higher fidelity graphics than other contemporary games. It was also a highly influential title of its time, opening the floodgates to several other laserdisc titles, such as Space Ace, Bega's Battle, and Cliff Hanger.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair puts players in the greaves of Dirk the Daring, a knight trying to rescue the Princess Daphne. Daphne has been kidnapped by Singe the Dragon, and is now being held in the castle. Dirk's adventure will have him battling monsters and the castle alike as he attempts to save the day.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair played like an animated Choose Your Own Adventure book.[CR]The gameplay of Dragon's Lair varies wildly from version to version, a common misconception is that the "Quick Time Event" game is the only version of Dragon's Lair in existence, however on platforms like the NES and SNES, Dragon's Lair is a 2D platformer requiring players to navigate multi-tiered stages, finding one of multiple exits to complete a level and progress through the castle to the final boss fight. The QTE-focused game only appears on certain platforms, in this variation of the game players watch and sometimes control Dirk through his adventures though Singe's castle. At very specific intervals during the game, Dirk will be in a situation that will force the player to control him, choosing which to direction to move him in around or having him attack enemies. Each of these sequences would trigger a new scene in the movie to start playing, similar to the way a DVD can have different "chapters" to select at any time. Choosing the right action in these confrontations would cause Dirk to circumnavigate his obstacle with aplomb, while choosing the wrong action would trigger a sequence in which Dirk is killed. The player is helped out by some degree of input clues such as flashing lights letting them know the direction to push. Added help to these sequences was added in the iPhone version which by default causes the on screen controls to flash the correct input, although this feature can be turned of if desired. The limited, simple button pressing gameplay set to cinematic action that would later evolve into the Quick Time Event, featured in games like Shenmue, Resident Evil 4, and Heavy Rain.[CR]In the original arcade version, the castle's rooms were presented in a semi-randomized order. The player would advance to a new room regardless of whether they could complete the previous one, however before the final confrontation with the dragon, the player would be required to replay the scenes they failed. In addition many of the rooms played "in reverse" (meaning, a jump to the left became a jump to the right the second time a scene played) meaning that even if one were to memorize every room in the castle they would still have to keep a keen eye on the layout of each room. The high score table was usually part of a separate cabinet extension.[CR]An experienced player who memorized every input for every scene could complete the game in less than 10 minutes. These experienced players soon realized that the player's score was increased with every successful input, regardless if the scene ended in success or failure. Thus, the score could be inflated by purposely dying before the last move of a long scene, and saving the last "life" for the final scene with the dragon. As new lives were rewarded throughout the game, these players could extend their play time to 20 minutes or more on one credit.[CR]Development[CR]Dragon&#8217;s Lair was the brain child of Rick Dyer, president of Advanced Microcomputer Systems, who, supposedly, realized that video games needed top quality animation during a viewing of the animated film The Secret of NIMH. He also claims that the Atari 2600 classic &#8220;Adventure&#8221; was another inspiration for Dragon&#8217;s Lair. The entire game was animated by Disney Animator Don Bluth at his personal studio. The game was made in less than 7 months for a mere one million dollars (cheap considering the work they were doing with new technology). The animators on the game couldn&#8217;t afford to hire real models to provide an appropriate frame for the Princess Daphne, so Cinematronic&#8217;s team apparently used Playboy magazines as an inspiration.[CR]Xbox Live Arcade Port[CR]On March 19th, 2012 it was announced that Dragon's Lair was coming to Xbox Live Arcade. The port is developed by Digital Leisure and published by Microsoft Studios. The Xbox Live Arcade port includes support for the standard controller, as well as Kinect.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 30 Extra Lives (PAL Version)[CR]Enter the name BATS at the high score screen to gain 30 extra lives on your next game.</plot>

				<title_clean>Duck Hunt</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Duck Hunt was first developed in conjunction with the Laser Clay Shooting System. This system was a light gun simulation made by Nintendo. The game itself was created by Nintendo Research and Development Team 1 in 1973, a time before Nintendo had branched into game development. The game was directed by Takehiro Izushi and produced by Gunpei Yokoi. The same team were responsible for the creation and development of the light gun used by the game. The game's original soundtrack was composed by Koji Kondo and Hirokazu Tanaka.[CR]A home version of Duck Hunt was later included as part of a two-game package with the original Super Mario Bros. for the NES in 1984. It was later included in a three-in-one game cartridge that also included Super Mario Bros. and World Class Track Meet. The NES version of Duck Hunt was the first game to make use of the Zapper Light Gun NES peripheral.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]There are three game modes: 1 Duck, 2 Ducks, and Clay Pigeons. In 1 Duck and 2 Ducks, the game is set in a wetlands where the player's hunting dog chases ducks out of a marsh. Each round tasks the player with shooting a series of ducks out of the air with the Zapper. Depending on the mode selected, one or two ducks will appear at a time. To progress to the next round, the player must shoot down a set number of ducks, with the number of ducks required to progress increasing as the player proceeds further into the game. Each time a duck (or pair of ducks) flies on screen, the player is given three shots. If the player misses with all three shots, the ducks will fly away.[CR]Should the player fail to shoot down any ducks in a set, the dog will rise out of the marsh and laugh at the player before the next ducks appear on screen. The dog will also laugh at the player when a Game Over occurs by failing to shoot enough ducks to proceed to the next round. Though it's not possible to shoot the dog in the NES version of the game, it is possible to do so in Vs. Duck Hunt, the arcade version.[CR]In the Clay Pigeon mode, the game is set on a shooting range in which clay pigeon targets are launched into the air and fly into the distance. Similar to the duck-hunting modes, the player must shoot down a set number of pigeons to advance to subsequent rounds.[CR]References in Other Games[CR]Duck Hunt&#8217;s characters have since made appearances in other games. The dog can be seen in Barker Bill&#8217;s Trick Shooting, and in Super Smash Brothers Brawl a trophy featuring ducks from the game can be unlocked.[CR]In Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS, both the dog and a duck are a playable fighter collectively called Duck Hunt. The duo's special moves and Final Smash reference various light gun games.[CR]Technical Details About the Light Gun[CR]The Zapper Light Gun, like all light gun peripherals of a similar design, is essentially a light sensor in a barrel. When the player presses the trigger, the game screen turns black for a brief moment, save for a small white square that appears on screen in position of a valid target. The player scores a hit if the light sensor in the barrel detects a white square on the screen.[CR]The nature of the technology involved makes it easy to essentially cheat at Duck Hunt. For example, by simply pointing the gun at a lamp, the game always registers hits. Also, by putting a magnifying lens in front of the barrel, the player can make the Zapper see a larger part of the screen, which lessens the need for correct aiming.[CR]When there is more than one target on the screen, instead of showing a black screen with a white spot, the game will show the light gun a black screen and then a plain white screen. Because the entire screen is turned white in this instance, the nature of the gun/screen interface changes.[CR]If a screen has only four pixels, with pixel A on the top right hand corner, B top left hand corner, C in the bottom left hand corner, and D in the bottom right hand corner, the four pixels will become white in the following order A, B, C, and then D.Arms of the trade.[CR]For the purposes of this explanation, this screen cycles from all black to all white in the following order. (Note that the actual time is much faster than the milliseconds used to illustrate.)millisecond 0: all blackmillisecond 1: A white BCD blackmillisecond 2: AB white CD blackmillisecond 3: ABC white D blackmillisecond 4: ABCD white[CR]If the target is at pixel B and the player is aiming correctly, the screen turns black when the trigger is pulled, and then the screen starts to become white. After two milliseconds, pixel B will become white and the light gun will send a positive signal to the NES. The NES knows that the target was at pixel B and that after the player pulled the trigger, it took two milliseconds for the Zapper to send the signal to the console. By doing some calculations, the game can then recognize that the target has been shot. Duck Hunt uses this technique to allow for more than one target on screen at a time.CRT Requirement[CR]Duck Hunt and other light gun titles of the era were designed to function based on the mechanics of a cathode ray tube (CRT) television. Specifically, the light gun is designed to work with the way a CRT display refreshes the displayed image from frame to frame. Different latency in later model high definition (HD) displays accounts for the problems with light gun functionality on these devices.[CR]Wii U Virtual Console Release[CR]Duck Hunt will become the first light gun shooter released in the Virtual Console line of classic game rereleases. Its release on the Wii U requires the player use a Wii Remote to play. Because the Wii Remote pointer functions via an IR sensor, it avoids the limitations of a light gun peripheral and thus allows for the game to be playable on an HD flat-screen television display.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Frozen targets[CR]Start a target shooting game and have an extra controller plugged in to port 1 and the light gun in port 2. Press start on the controller in port 1 to pause the game when you unpause the game the targets will remain frozen for a few seconds giving you a clean shot.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Control Ducks[CR]When playing on Mode A (the one with only one duck), controller one can control the ducks to make a sort of multiplayer game.</plot>

				<plot>The seedy underworld is crawling with criminals. Even worse - the JOKER is back on top of 'em all! Law and order means nothing... until now! Because BATMAN is here - and the action is hotter than ever! Ear-crunching sound effects. Pulse-quickening music. Graphics that are as hot as 16-bit. And this time, BATMAN hits fast and hard. Flying, leaping, and sliding to attack! And striking at the heart of the JOKER. The CAPED CRUSADER has a totally new arsenal at his command: Batarang, Crossbow, Sonic Neutralizer. He's even got a superfueled jetpack. And even more powerful weapons at the touch of a button. BATMAN has got to use all of his power. Because this world is a very dark place, and you never know where the JOKER is hiding![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]At the title screen, press and hold Start + A to unlock the sound test mode</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Before there was Adventures of Lolo, there was Eggerland. In this sequel to the first Eggerland for the Famicom Disk System, Lolo must once again pass through a series of puzzle stages to reach King Egger and rescue his love Lala.[CR]Meikyuu no Fukkatsu ("Revival of the Labyrinth") refers to the second MSX Eggerland game, named Labyrinth Myth. As in that game, Lolo must not only traverse across various single-screen puzzle stages but also discover the correct path through these stages to locate King Egger. This is opposed to Adventures of Lolo, in which each stage is presented one after the other in a linear fashion.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As with every Eggerland/Adventures of Lolo game, the goal is to collect all the heart icons on each screen and then find the way back to a treasure chest. Collecting the key it contains opens the doors out of the stage and eliminates any enemies on the screen, rendering that particular stage "complete" and safe to travel through.[CR]Failing to collect the heart icons in the right order - the game requires a certain amount of strategy - will lead to Lolo either getting caught by enemies or trapped in a stalemate situation where he cannot continue. In the latter case, the player can leave the area and come back or hit the Select button to self-destruct; either action will reset the current stage.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Final Battle Password[CR]At the password screen, enter the following Japanese characters. Format is Row #, Column #.</plot>

				<title_clean>Elevator Action</title_clean>
				<plot>You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.[CR]Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:[CR]1. Shooting them with his gun.[CR]2. Kicking them by jumping onto them.[CR]3. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.[CR]4. Crushing them with an elevator.[CR]Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.[CR]While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. [CR]Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.[CR]Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.[CR]If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.</plot>

				<plot>You are Agent 17 (codename: "Otto"). Your mission is to secure all top secret documents from a security building and escape in the getaway car, located in the basement of the building.[CR]Enemies spies are scattered throughout the 30-floor building and they have only one mission: execute Agent 17 at all costs. There are several ways in which Agent 17 can kill them:[CR]1. Shooting them with his gun.[CR]2. Kicking them by jumping onto them.[CR]3. Shooting a light on the ceiling while in an elevator, dropping the light onto one of them.[CR]4. Crushing them with an elevator.[CR]Whenever a light has been dropped, the hallways will be dark for a short period of time, making the enemy spies harder to see. The same holds true for hallways that are already dark.[CR]While Otto is in an elevator, he will have complete control of it by moving up or down. Agent 17 can still get killed if he's already in an elevator if a bullet's trajectory is aimed at it.. When Otto is not in an elevator, it will move from floor to floor automatically, even when enemy spies are in it. Otto is able to leap over the elevator gaps, but he must be as close to the edge as possible without falling off in order to make the jump safely. If there is an elevator cable in the way, however, it will block him, causing him to fall. [CR]Just because the game is called Elevator Action doesn't mean that elevators are the only means of travel. There are also escalators which you can ride up or down, useful if you want to avoid gunfire and don't have time to jump.[CR]Otto must go into the rooms with red doors to collect the top secret documents. If he tries to get to his car without getting all the documents, he cannot escape and must go back and collect the remaining documents. Once he has all the documents and drives away, he then proceeds to the next building.[CR]If Otto takes too much time to collect the documents, the alarm will go off, and he will have trouble controlling the elevators, which will take time to react. Bad guys will be especially aggressive. The alarm doesn't go off when Otto loses a life, it only resets after finishing a building. Besides ducking, bad guys may also drop themselves and lay flat on the floor. It's virtually impossible for Otto to shoot bad guys when they do this. Also, Otto cannot duck when in an elevator.</plot>

				<title_clean>Elite</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Elite is a space trader game with cockpit-view space travel sections that occasionally involved combat. Originally released for the BBC Micro in 1984, it was quickly ported to various other systems both inside and outside the UK. It was followed by multiple sequels that expanded the depth of the game's vision of a fully explorable universe, the most recent of which is the 2014 game Elite: Dangerous.[CR]The game starts as all Elite games do by setting the player into the open world with 100 credits and a lightly-armed cargo ship (the Cobra Mk III in this instance). The main thrust of the game is to simply earn credits through trading goods between different space stations and making a profit by taking advantage of the variable prices of different products between systems. This is not the only method by which the player can earn credits, however, and Elite was revolutionary at the time in that it allows the player free choice in which role/roles they enter into during gameplay. Ships encountered can be destroyed and plundered, military missions can be taken up, asteroids can be mined for resources and lucrative bounty hunting contracts are available. The player is never tied into a career and can jump between jobs at any point. Beyond this there is no overarching story or even backstory with the aim of the game being simply to explore and earn credits.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] revolves around travel between planets (planetary systems are not available) by way of a hyperspace drive which requires fuel to be replenished at the destination port. The skill behind the gameplay was in choosing the right items to trade so the maximum credits were earned from different trading runs.[CR]Military missions mostly involves destroying ships or transporting sensitive cargo, but aimed to take the player to parts of the universe not often explored, such as anarchic worlds never worth the risk for a simple trade run. Similarly, destroying ships often revolve around attacking unique prototype ships leading to intense dogfights of a higher difficulty to those randomly encountered travelling between planets.[CR]Bounty hunting runs along similar lines with missions taking the player into dangerous territory and often involves fighting higher quality ships for which the player received far greater monetary rewards. Credits can be spent on ship upgrades which in turn unlocks varied types of gameplay. Mining lasers allows the mining of asteroids which often gives up valuable minerals whilst making the player a tempting target for pirates, and the fuel scoop allowed the player to catch fuel by skillfully flying close to the surface of stars.[CR]Locations[CR]The notion of an open-world game at the time was unheard of. With eight galaxies and 256 planets in each galaxy the game had to be procedurally generated to due to the limitations of the 8-bit computers of the time (the entire game fits into 22KB of memory on the BBC Micro, for example). As such each galaxy, whilst being unique to each player, will all have planets with a pre-determined composition. The issue with creating the galaxies by this method is that it would occasionally lead to galaxies being in positions whereupon reaching them, the hyperspace drive would not be powerful enough to transport the player out again, which in essence broke the game.[CR]Planets vary in terms of safety with some entirely safe and others more prone to attack by the game's primary antagonists, the Thargoids (whose homeworld was highly dangerous) and pirates who would intercept the player in more lawless territories. Technical limitations ensured that the player not land on planets, with every planet having an orbiting space station that they could dock into but not explore.[CR][B]Sequels:[/B][CR]With the game garnering high critical praise and selling handsomely sequels were forthcoming.  Frontier: Elite 2 was released in 1993 adding textures, an expanded game world and a new control method, moving the game away from its Arcade-style along with a raft of other expansions. This was followed by  Frontier: First Encounters which garnered significant negative press due to its premature release resulting in the game being filled with game-breaking bugs. Elite 4 has been in development since 1999 for PC and modern consoles yet the lack of information on it has led to fears of the game being vaporware. All that has been heard is that the game was once an MMO before being restarted due to technical limitations and more recently a source indicated to eurogamer.net that pre-production has been put on hold indefinitely while Frontier Development's title "The Outsider" was completed.[CR]In December of 2014, the Kickstarter-funded sequel Elite: Dangerous was released for the PC, with Mac and console versions to follow. Elite: Dangerous was one of the first games to be featured on the Xbox One's Game Preview Program.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]It was possible to come across a product named 'Tribbles' when visiting space stations. If the player decides to buy it and then undock into open space again, after a short time of flying, small light-colored blobs will start to appear on the screen. After a while the whole screen will be completely filled with these blobs making it completely impossible to fly. This is a reference to the Star Trek (the original series) episode called "The Trouble with Tribbles", where small furry animals get into a space station and start breeding at a phenomenal rate until they completely infest it. This is only available in the Commodore 64 version.In certain versions when docking or during the intro the Blue Danube Waltz is played as a nod to 2001: A Space Odyssey.Stills of the game were displayed in the music video for 'Pump Up The Volume' by MARRS.The launch of game was unique for the time. A special larger box housed the game and came with a novella on the game world to gain extra attention. The game was launched at a launch party at Thorpe Theme Park in the UK (an unheard of marketing move at the time) and there was a contest for the first gamer to reach "Elite" rank within the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Clear Save-RAM[CR]Press and hold Up + Left + B + Select on Controller 1, then reset the console to clear your SRAM.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 10000 credits[CR]Dock at a space station and change your name to Cheater to get an additional 10,000 credits. It can only be done once and you will no longer be able to change your name.</plot>

				<plot>Elnark no Zaihou is an Action game, published by Towachiki, which was released in Japan in 1987.[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/nes/home/578459.html[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Backtrack (Stage 1)[CR]During Stage 1, part of progressing through the stage involves running northward against a wall to get through to the other side. This is normally a one-way trip, meaning that anything left on the other side is lost for good. However, if you wish to return, press A and Down on Controller 1, then A and B on Controller 2.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Passwords[CR]From the second option on the title screen, you can enter these passwords. Note that these are in the format of - Row #, Column # -.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Alignment Neutrality[CR]To get through this game, you will often have to gather items to alter your Alignment - the bottom gauge of the top-left corner - so you can get to certain areas you are required to go to; sometimes, you have to be Light ("L") or Dark ("D"), depending on the situation. Obtaining the proper Alignment can be a tedious or impossible process, if not just threatening to your health, as all such items do not respawn, leaving you to die if you do not already have the right Alignment but have already grabbed all of the items. However, there is a way around this - if you stay in the middle of the gauge, you can get to both Light- and Dark-requiring areas due to an oversight in the game's programming. (Alignment is measured from 1 to 24, meaning 12 is in the middle: you can use this info when you pick up Alignment-altering items which add or subtract 1 or 8 units per the item list given in the game's intro. All you have to do after reaching neutrality is never pick up an Alignment-altering item again.)</plot>

				<title_clean>Elysion</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Elysion, though a fairly traditional 8-bit JRPG in many respects (the first thing the player does is talk to the local King for exposition, for example), draws its influences from a lot of very different games within the RPG family: It superficially resembles the first Dragon Quest, it allows the player to select between multiple protagonists when starting the game as is the case in Final Fantasy, the combat system is real-time combat without screen transitions such as something like Hydlide or Ys and the enemies have an odd habit of only moving when the player does, such is the case in many strategic Roguelike dungeon crawlers like the Mystery Dungeon series.[CR]The goal of the game is to defeat the evil demon Baal. However, the King first tests the player character by having them enter the dungeon beneath the castle and find a group of important quest objects. After completing this large dungeon, the protagonist officially becomes the Hero of God and can go defeat Baal by exploring the rest of the continent for some necessary magical scrolls and, eventually, special God-like equipment.[CR]"Elysion" refers to the Elysian Fields, an ancient Roman underworld for honorable souls that died in battle.ClassesThe four classes[CR]The player can start as one of four heroes, each a different race with specific strengths:Minos (blue) are warrior types, able to cut through swathes of monster with only their swords and limited magic.Aylex (Purple) are primarily magic users, with weak melee strength. Best used at a distance.Dionea (Red) are a female archer class, also suited for distant attacks.Viskam (Green) are effective fighters and magic-users both, though do not excel at either.[CR]Oddly, if the player chooses a female character (Aylex/Dionea), many enemies in the game will look a little different. For instance, many of the knight enemies have ponytails, suggesting that they are also female. As well as different playstyles, each of the four heroes has a unique ending, giving the game some replayability.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Erika to Satoru no Yume Bouken</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Erika to Satoru no Yume Bouken ("Erika and Satoru's Dream Adventure") is a fairytale-inspired menu-driven adventure game, of the sort that were very popular on the NES in Japan. The idea is to use the menu commands to interact with the world: moving around, looking around, picking up objects, talking to people, etc.[CR]In a novel twist, the two characters of Erika and Satoru (who are depicted as twin schoolchildren) are independently playable - either a single player switches between the two, or a second player takes over the second twin. Both characters need to be in the same region to converse with NPCs, but are otherwise free to explore the map autonomously.[CR]An odd bit of infamy related to this game is a secret developer's message that can be found if the player inputs a list of button presses after waiting some time after the game ends. Inside of which is a litany of compliments and complaints to other co-workers, including some sexual insults which are deeply at odds with the child-friendly nature of the game. It also refers to, among other things, the work Atlus did for LJN including The Karate Kid. The message and its contents are described further in this article.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret Ending Message[CR]After beating the game, at the "END" screen, let the game sit there for one hour and thirty-one minutes. During this time, the end screen will go to grayscale, then to sepia-tone. At the end of this 91-minute period, the background music stops. At that point, press and hold Left, A, B, Select, and Start on Player 1's controller and Right, A, and B on Player 2's controller. This will bring some new music. When said music starts, press Right, Select, and B on Player 1's controller and Down, Right, and B on Player 2's controller to get Hidemushi's message. When it stops, press Up, A, and B on Player 1's controller for another message. After this, wait 18 minutes and you will return to the title screen.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hidden Messages[CR]Enter the Japanese syllables below as passwords for hidden messages.</plot>

Depending on what you enter, there's a chance of getting additional items and such. These passwords will show four numbers and an indicator of which D-Pad button to press - for example, if "5 up" were to be said, you press Up on the D-Pad five times before going to the next character. (Spaces in the passwords are revealed when you go up one and down one, so note that as well.) When you are done entering these passwords, for them to take effect, you must hold Up and Left on Player 2's controller before pressing Start on Player 1's, and hold it until the introductory cutscene ends.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Exciting Boxing is part of the Exciting sports range of Konami titles, most of which were made for the Arcade and then ported to the Famicom. Exciting Boxing was developed solely for the Famicom and included a special inflatable controller. The idea was that hitting the inflatable boxer triggered sensors inside the controller that would tell the game where the player hit and with how much power.[CR]The goal of the game is to make it past seven boxers, each the champion of their respective weight category from Flyweight to Heavyweight and, like Punch-Out!!, the seven come from all over the world.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret Masked Fighter[CR]After you beat all 7 opponents and the "END" screen is displayed, hold Up + A on the second controller, then press any button on the first controller. Instead of the regular title screen, you'll get to the secret opponent challenge request. Press Start then select the "VS MODE" to play it. (Note: the Password 66666666666666666664 also gives you this fight.)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Passwords[CR]Enter these 20-character passwords by selecting Continue from the title screen.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Exerion is a vertical-scrolling shooter, where the player's ship would shoot upwards to take out waves of enemies. Though most of the screen was a static black, on the bottom half of the screen the player could see the horizon of whichever planet they were on rushing towards them, including various geographical fixtures whizzing past in a manner similar to parallax scrolling.[CR]The game is an example of an early shoot-em-up: There are no power-ups, just waves of enemies. Players had a limited number of lives and had to start over once they ran out. Enemies, rather than departing the screen upon passing the player's ship, would home in towards them in order to collide with and destroy them: The player had to circle back around and maneuver underneath the enemies in order to shoot them down.[CR]Exerion had four versions: The original 1983 arcade version, its initial MSX home version of the following year, a Sega SG-1000 version and an eventual Famicom version in 1985. The Famicom version would also be rereleased on the Wii Shop's Virtual Console decades later. The arcade version, though the best looking, was also the hardest to play as the ship had a strong sense of inertia and momentum to it, making it sluggish to move and difficult to control. The home versions were better regarded.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>F-1 Race</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]F1 Race was the first racing game developed for the Famicom console, by Nintendo themselves. Unlike the far more comical Mario Kart series which would later become Nintendo's de facto racing game franchise, F1 Race is a straightforward emulation of Formula One racing. The game does, however, feature various cameos of early Nintendo characters such as Mario and Donkey Kong.[CR]Graphically, the game takes the "behind the car" viewpoint made popular by games such as Pole Position and OutRun. The player is required to steer the car to match turns in the road as they approach, while also passing other cars without crashing into them.[CR]The game was never released outside of Japan, though a later Game Boy version would see a release in both US and Europe territories.[CR]Game Boy Version[CR]The Game Boy version of F-1 Race was released in 1990, and featured different courses from around the world. The game featured both a Time Trial Mode, and a Challenge Mode. For each race, players could choose between two different cars, called Type-A and Type-B, each car had slightly different set ups. One of these cars had a higher regular top speed, whereas the other had a lower regular top speed, but had a higher top speed while boosting.[CR]F-1 Race was among the first of the Game Boy games to feature battery back-up, so that a player's best times could be stored. It was also often packaged with the Nintendo Game Boy four player adapter, which allowed up to four Game Boys to be connected together via the adapter and three additional link cables.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>F1 Circus is a Formula 1 simulation racing game. Unlike later entries in the series, this version does not feature an official license, and so only features generic teams and drivers. Races are viewed from a top-down perspective, and there are a variety of machine settings as well as basic vehicle damage.[CR]A total of 15 courses are on offer, and there is a World Championship mode, as well as a "Constructors" mode for one or two players where the player can take the role of team manager while the computer does the actual racing. The Famicom release also adds a Time Attack mode for practicing and perfecting each course.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Ending[CR]To see the game ending, press and hold  Up, A, B, Select, Start and press Reset.

				<title_clean>Famicom Wars</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] In 1988,      Intelligent Systems released Famicom Wars, their first game for the Nintendo console (Famicom). This turn based, military strategy game, laid the foundations for the     Nintendo Wars series and introduced its hallmark mechanics and cartoonish style. Although Famicom Wars never saw a release outside of Japan, subsequent games in the series, better known as Advance Wars, became international hits.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]  A battle map     Players control one of two armies--Red Star or Blue Moon. The goal is to attack the opposing force by using a variety of land, air and sea units. Each turn, players receive currency based on the number of buildings and facilities they have under their control; they then use this currency to produce more military forces. Players achieve victory by either capturing the enemy's headquarters or clearing the map all visible enemy units. Though gameplay takes place on an overhead, grid-based map, battles between units unfold through short, animated cut scenes.   The strategy players utilize in Famicom Wars revolves around the inherent strengths and weaknesses of each unit. Units relate to each other in a rock-paper-scissors fashion: jet-fighters are strong against other air units, but weak against anti-air missile launchers; likewise, although anti-air missile launchers can decimate flying foes, they are susceptible to tanks and other ground-based units. Furthermore, only infantry and combat engineers are able to capture enemy and neutral facilities, such as military bases, cities, factories, airports and sea ports.   Terrain also plays a large role in strategy. Whereas roads and flatlands allow for greater unit mobility per turn, they offer little in the way of defense. Forests and mountains, on the other hand, impinge on unit movement but provide a large defense bonus.      Man-made facilities constitute the final element of Famicom Wars gameplay. Each army begins a game with a military base which can create ground units and provides currency each turn. Similarly, captured seaports and airports also offer an amount of funding per turn and allow the creation of sea and air units. Players can further increase the amount of funds they receive by capturing cities. Factories, similar to military bases, allow for the production of ground units, but they are the only facility in the game that does not reward the player with currency.    [CR]Units[CR] Ground UnitsInfantry    Equipped with a machine-gun, this unit can traverse mountains, forests and rivers. Along with the combat    engineer, this is the only unit able to capture military bases, factories, seaports, airports and cities.     Combat Engineer   Equipped with a missile launcher, the combat engineer's movement is slightly less than regular infantry, but it    excels at attacking land-based vehicles. Along with infantry, this is the only unit able to capture enemy    or neutral facilities.Tank   This heavily armored, highly mobile unit comes in two varieties, heavy and light.APC    The APC is able to transport infantry and combat engineers over long distances, but lacks any sort of weaponry.Artillery    The long-reaching attack of the artilary unit is balanced by weak amormment and the inability to attack adjacent    units. Like the tank, there are two varieties, heavy and light.Anti-Air Missile Launcher     Able to attack aircraft at a distance, but it lacks the ability to engage land and sea forces.Flack Cannon    Similar to the anti-air missle launcher, the flack cannon can only attack air units. It is weaker than its counterpart,    but also cheaper to produce.Supply Truck   Though it lacks any weaponry, the supply truck can resupply ammunition and gasoline to any units in the field. Air Units Jet Fighter   This air-to-air unit comes in two varieties, heavy and light.Bomber    The bomber lacks defensive capabilities, but its range and attack power allows it to decimate land-based units.Transport Helicopter   An airborne version of the apc--able to transport infantry or combat engineers over long distances.     Sea Units Battleship   A seaborne version of artillery--Its long range also means it cannot attack directly adjacent units.Transport Ship   Similar to its land-based and seaborne brethren, the transport ship can ferry inrantry and combat engineers across    water obstacles.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Clear Save Data[CR]At the main game menu, before the game starts, press and hold A + B both on the first controller and the second controller at the same time, then press Start on the first controller.</plot>

				<title_clean>Family Circuit</title_clean>
				<plot>Family Circuit is a racing game for Nintendo's Family Computer (known to some as the NES), hence the name. Unlike other Nintendo racing games at the time, it has many realistic traits, removing itself from the main crop of more arcade oriented titles. The car can be customized to your heart's content, with different tires, wings and suspension and detailed engine settings for both turbo and torque.[CR]Four racing modes are available:[CR]1. Free run: Run any way you want around the track, getting to know both the curves and straights as well as the settings of your car.[CR]2. Sprint race: Race a season in four classes  novice, B class, A class and Super A  around well-known (Fuji, Suzuka) and less well-known tracks (Family Park, Namcot-ring), competing for the first place.[CR]3. Endurance race: Run around and around a track to see who gives up last.[CR]4. Spectator mode: Not a real racing mode, but allows you to follow any car in any class around any track.[CR]As you bump into things or push the car too far, you must pit in, where you will be given statistics for each part of the car and may choose to fix it. Some of this realism is however forfeited by the fact that cars can never collide. Racing straight through an opponent with both cars undamaged is perfectly possible.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Win[CR]At the main menu, select the 3rd option (Sprint Race). Input your name and press Start. On the next screen, press Start again. On the next screen, select any of the 4 options (only the 4th option, Super A, will give you the real ending). On the next screen, you'll have the option to start the Qualifying Race, but if you press Select + A you can skip it (if you start the qualification race, you can press Select to quit). On the next menu screen, select the bottom option and you'll be shown the qualification results (you'll be in 8th place if you skipped it). On the next screen, you'll have the option to start the race, but just press Select + A to skip it. If you did it right, you'll see the results screen, all the opponents will be named "X" and you'll be on 8th place. On the next screen, everyone will have 0 points, but you'll be in first place. Repeat this process for every race and you'll be able to beat the game without completing a single race.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Family Jockey is a horse-racing sim in which the player chooses a horse to ride and wins races to rake in prize money. The races get progressively harder and there are some raising sim aspects to help the horse run faster and make sure their stamina bar lasts longer. There's also a mode where players can gamble on AI races. [CR]Family Jockey was remade a few times on other systems, such as the Game Boy, PC-Engine and, eventually, the Wii. [CR]</plot>

After the player has learned how to play, they can compete against a series of CPU opponents in one-on-one matches, most of whom are attractive blonde women for whatever reason.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Family Mahjong II: Shanghai e no Michi is a Mahjong game and the direct sequel to Family Mahjong. In addition to the standard Mahjong mode, there is a tournament mode with a slight RPG aspect to it, in that the player can enhance certain stats after winning games in order to increase their odds in future rounds of the tournament.[CR]The game is a one-on-one version of the game, less common in real-life Mahjong games but the standard for computer adaptations due to the reduced complexity of having only a single AI opponent. Nihon Bussan was responsible for Family Mahjong II's development and was at the time fairly well known for their Mahjong Arcade games.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 1.6 Million Points Password[CR]At the password screen, press the directional keys to change the Mahjong pieces to the appropriate symbol:Piece 1: Press Up 1 time.Piece 2: Right 1 time, Up 1 time.Piece 3: Right 1 time, Up 3 times.Piece 4: Left 1 time, Down 2 times.Piece 5: Left 1 time, Up 2 times.Piece 6: Left 1 time, Up 2 times.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Family Quiz is a Japanese trivia game where the goal is to beat the other opponents in four mini-games, each requiring that the player answer some Japanese trivia questions in order to proceed. The four mini-games are based on: A typical game show set up, where answering questions correctly raises that player's podium towards a balloon; Othello, where the goal is to surround the other player's pieces; a board-game, where the player moves their piece around the board; a card-based memory game, where the goal is to flip over pairs of matching cards. In each game, the player gets a turn only after they've answered the trivia question correctly.[CR]This was Athena's first NES release.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Family Tennis released December 11, 1987 exclusively in Japan for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The fourth of Namco's lengthy "Family" series of sports games and the first to concentrate on tennis, Family Tennis plays much like its Nintendo forebear and other tennis game contemporaries. It shares the same viewpoint from behind the court and requires that the player make their way to where each shot is heading and return the ball by tapping the swing button in order to win.[CR]Family Tennis has a few notable quirks, however. First, is that the many fictional tennis players available all superficially resemble actual real-life stars of the sport. The second is "Cosmos Mode", in which the action is taken to outer space. Besides the starry background and the astronaut ballboys, there's little functional difference however. There was also four female characters, of the sixteen total, who all had a bigger racket then the men. Essentially making the women into an 'Easy Mode'[CR]In 2002 it was ported into a Mobile App.[CR]Tennis Courts[CR]There are four different types of courts that can be selectedHard - Is the most average of the 4.Lawn - Grass court, with a low bounce.Clay - Court made of Soil, is the slowest.Cosmo - Higher bounce due to lower gravity.[CR]Tournaments[CR]All four of the Grand Slam of Tennis tournaments are represented, albeit with a letter change to Wimbledon. It also had Japan's own tournament, The Japan Open, as well as The fictional Cosmos Open.Japan OpenAustralian OpenFrench OpenWinbledon (Wimbledon)U.S. OpenCosmos Open[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Every Character was biased off of someone in real life and given a name in Japanese that had a meaning or was a japanese name, word or phrase that sounded like it's real life counterpart.  Every Character had different grades in abilities (with the exemption of the ladies who it can be assumed are all A's).Endoru meaning Yen-Dollar (Ivan Lindl) Service-A, Stroke-A, Volley-C, Footwork-ABunbun meaning hum or buzzing like a bee (Boris Becker) Service-A, Stroke-A, Volley-A, Footwork-AEdo which was the former name of Tokyo, and means Bay-Entrance (Stefan Edberg)  Service-B, Stroke-B, Volley-B, Footwork-BNiranderu is a phrase that means, you are anticipating (Mats Wilander) Service-B, Stroke-A, Volley-C, Footwork-BMeshiirazu is a phrase that means, no more rice (Miloslav Mecir) Service-C, Stroke-C, Volley-B, Footwork-ASukoncho or Be Concho (Henri Leconte) Service-B, Stroke-B, Volley-B, Footwork-BNoanoa or Of Anoa, a type of small water buffalo (Yannick Noah) Service-B, Stroke-B, Volley-C, Footwork-BMakerou means to lose, be defeated (John McEnroe) Service-C, Stroke-B, Volley-A, Footwork-AKoneezu (Jimmy Conners) Service-C, Stroke-A, Volley-B, Footwork-BByoru-gu (Bjorn Borg) Service-B, Stroke-A, Volley-C, Footwork-BKyatchu (Pat Cash) Service-B, Stroke-B, Volley-B, Footwork-BFukutaro (Tsuyoshi Fukui) Service-D, Stroke-C, Volley-C, Footwork-CNaburatchi literally translates to Nub Abduction (Martina Navratilova)Ebaruto (Chris Evert)Suteppi-i (Steffi Graf)Sabochiini (Gabriela Sabatini)[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The fifth in Bandai's series of Family Trainer games, created for the accessory with the same name (or Power Pad in the US). Unlike the others, which tended to be athletics/exercise games, Meiro Daisakusen ("Epic Maze Battle") is a maze-exploring light RPG where the goal is to walk and jump around mazes to find items and, eventually, the exit.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game's controls are dictated entirely by the Family Trainer/Power Pad. Different buttons will either cause the protagonist to jump, walk forward, walk backwards, turn left or right or switch their position to the left, right or center of the screen. While searching for the exit, players must be mindful of the various enemies that also inhabit the mazes, most of which must be avoided by jumping over them or running past them.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Family Trainer 6 - Manhattan Police</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Street Cop is the sixth game produced by Bandai for the Power Pad (or Family Trainer) accessory and the fifth and final to be released in the US. Notably, it was one of the few Power Pad games that Nintendo themselves did not publish in the US, leaving Bandai's American branch to handle the release.[CR]Unlike earlier games in the Family Trainer series, which tended to be athletic/exercise games, Street Cop has the player fighting crime by investigating suspicious hiding places and routing out the ne'er-do-wells with violence. In each mission the wanted criminal is shown briefly before absconding and its up to the player to direct the policeman around using the Power Pad buttons in order to track the criminal down. This involves going left and right, turning 90 degrees to enter different areas (when available) and turning 180 degrees to reverse direction. Players can also find items like aluminum cans, which can be thrown at criminals as well. Defeating all of the criminal's lackeys will force them to reveal themselves, allowing the player to arrest them and finish the level.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Super Team Games is a side scrolling game where two players compete in races on an obstacle course. The game utilizes the Nintendo Power Pad; to control your on screen character you will need to run in place on the Power Pad to make your character run, and actually jump to make him jump. In the basic game you need to run and jump your way to the finish line as fast as possible. Some additional game variations are available, such as the belly bump ball (you need to roll a giant ball through the obstacle course by running into it), the crab walk (make it to the finish line walking like a crab!), the water cross (water is found on the track; if you mistime your jump and land in the water you need to swim to get out costing you valuable time), the bubble run (racing through the course inside a giant bubble), or the skateboard race. Several cooperative games are included as well, including a tug of war, relay race, and six legged race.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The ship Opa-Opa.[CR]In contrast to the many dark fantasy and sci-fi shooters of its time, Fantasy Zone had bright and colorful pastel environments and enemies that were strange and often abstract looking.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]-wise it is pretty standard for the genre, but with some twists such as being able to walk on the ground. Upgrades are bought from shops appearing in the world as red balloons with the word shop on them. All the power-ups are temporary, but are powerful enough to be of considerable help when clearing the larger enemies needed to progress to the stage's boss.[CR]Fantasy Zone was originally an Arcade game but was ported to several consoles, not just those made by Sega. The gameplay was mostly the same in all versions, but the graphic quality varied depending on the platform.[CR]The 1986 Sega Master System version is the first SMS game to be released in the standard cartridge format, rather than the Super Card format the system had used up until that point. The cartridge allowed for a lot more memory, and Fantasy Zone was able to exploit this feature. The Famicom version is an official port by Sunsoft but the US NES version is an unlicensed Tengen release. The game was also released on the TurboGrafx-16 as well as appearing in multiple Sega compilations for more powerful systems.Virtual Console[CR]The Master System port of Fantasy Zone was released on the Wii Virtual Console on March 11th 2008 in Japan, April 11th in Europe and April 14th in the US.3D Classics[CR]In March 2014, Sega released a 3D Classics version on the Nintendo 3DS eShop as part of the second run of Sega 3D Classics remastered to be displayed in stereoscopic 3D for the platform.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound test[CR]Strange place to put a Sound test. But in the ending, while the credits are scrolling, press the Left button 33 times on controller 2. If done right, the sound test should appear once the credits end and before the game restarts.</plot>

				<title_clean>Faxanadu</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Faxanadu is a side-scrolling action-adventure game for the Nintendo Entertainment System, developed by Hudson Soft and first released in Japan in 1987. The game was subsequently let loose on the American market two years later, and in Europe a year after that. Faxanadu is a spin-off from the 1985 Falcom game "Xanadu," and the name "Faxanadu" is a portmanteau word derived from the amalgamation of the words "Famicom" and "Xanadu."[CR]Xanadu was actually the second in Falcom's Dragon Slayer series, originally made for Japanese home computer MSX though most of them would find their way onto the Famicom. Curiously, Faxanadu - the second Dragon Slayer - comes out right on the heels of Compile's port of Romancia, the third Dragon Slayer, which in turn was released a few months after Legacy of the Wizard, the fourth Dragon Slayer. All three games were co-developed with different developers.[CR]The game was released on the North American Virtual Console on the Wii on February 21, 2011.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Time to visit the King.[CR]The game begins with the player-character, who is never specifically named, seen trudging back to his home town of Eolis at the foot of the World Tree, only to find that all is not as it should be. The walls are crumbling and the wells have run dry, and the people are being savaged by a mysterious influx of monsters. Several of the non player-characters in the opening segments of the game, as if sensing the PC's unique brand of heroism, charge him with the task of restoring the land to its rightful state. Eolis's King tells him that the town's life source, the Elf Fountain water, is no longer flowing and that many men have perished in their efforts to discover what went wrong. As the town's last hope (the guy outside perpetually smoking a pipe must be a conscientious objector), the King sends the player character on their way with 1500 Golds (a famous and recurring translation error in the game), and leaves the player to get on with it. The player learns that the Dwarves at the top of the World Tree have discovered a meteorite and have been manipulated by it, turning insane and damaging the World Tree and it's water system, while attacking the elves, the other inhabitants of the World Tree. It is up to the player to defeat the evil influence and restore the World Tree, restoring peace between the dwarves, elves and the humans.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The World Tree.[CR]The game's starting town of Eolis is situated at the base of an exceptionally large tree known as the World Tree, which constitutes the game's various areas. The player steadily moves upwards through the World Tree in a mostly linear fashion, although it is possible and indeed necessary in some cases to backtrack, in order to open new doors or to buy items, weapons and armor. The player will encounter a wide variety of enemies on his travels, from large skulls that hop on one leg to shuffling crab-like creatures with large spines for protection. Enemies can be defeated in a variety of ways, ranging from physical attacks such as daggers and swords, to projectile magic spells. As the game progresses and the player gains access to more towns, the player's weapons, magic and armor can be upgraded using the gold that the enemies occasionally drop once eliminated. Other enemies will drop food, which will restore a small amount of health points instead.[CR]The player also earns experience points as enemies are defeated, which increases the player's Experience Rank, earning them new titles. In this sense, Faxanadu incorporates some RPG elements to its gameplay alongside the more action-oriented fighting mechanics.[CR]The game could not be saved as such, although the player could receive a password in the form of a Mantra that the Gurus in the game's many towns would reveal upon visiting them, allowing the player to continue from the place in which the Mantra was received.Towns[CR]Faxanadu has many towns that the player can visit. In order of discovery, they are Eilos, Apolune, Forepaw, Mascon, Victim, Conflate, Daybreak and Dartmoor.[CR]Each town holds host to a general list of establishments, but some towns will be absent of particular locations. For example, the first town in the game, Eolis, contains establishments not found later in the game, such as a gym which restores health. Some locations are not exclusive to towns, either. Hardware stores, churches and homes can be found in dungeons.Church: Players can consult the gurus to save their game, recieve valuable information or items such as rings.Butcher: Players can buy fresh food, which will restore a small amount of mana and health.Hardware Store: Players can purchase items such as weapons, potions or elixers.Inn: Players can speak to patrons to learn information.Hospital: Players can pay a fee to have all their health and mana restored.Locksmith: Players can buy keys here.Home: Another location where players can gain information.LootPlayers can switch out different items in any location.[CR]Loot such as armor, weapons, magic spells or items can be found out in the wild, or purchased from stores. Prices of items vary from town to town, usually getting more expensive as the game progresses. For example: in the starting town, a Red Potion is 160 gold. But at the final town in the game it costs 1200 gold.WeaponsHand Dagger: The first weapon available to the player. It has a very limited range and cannot attack ground enemies.Long SwordGiant BladeDragon Slayer: Obtained by killing the King Dwarf. When equipped, the player can use the Battle Suit and Battle Helmet. It is required to defeat the final boss.ArmorLeather ArmorStudded MailFull PlateBattle SuitShield[CR]Shields can block magic attacks, but the player must be stationary for it to work.Small ShieldLarge ShieldMagic ShieldBattle HelmetMagic[CR]Magic can be obtained through stores and uses the player's mana.DelugeThunderDeathFire: Taught by a wizard in the outskirts of Victim for 3000 gold. It sends enemies across the room.Tilte: The most powerful spell in the game. It can be purchased in Daybreak for 15000 gold.Items[CR]All items mentioned are single use.Red Potion: Will restore all of the player's health.Elixir: If the player is killed, the Elixir will automatically bring them back to life, restoring all their health and mana.Wing Boots: Allows the player to levitate for a short while to gain access to areas unreachable by foot. It is required at a certain point in the game to reach a spring in the sky.Key: Are used to gain access to doors. Each key has an inscription such as King, Queen, Joker etc; and will only open its corresponding lock. For example, a Jack key will only only a Jack door and so on.Mattock: Can be used to destroy small sections of walls, and is necessary to gain access to the town of Forepaw.Hour Glass: Will stop movement of all enemies on the screen, allowing the player to defeat them easily, but will not work on bosses.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]Faxanadu was composed by Jun Chikuma and is regarded as having one of the most memorable soundtracks of any NES game, and various modern-day renditions of the game's wide assortment of music can be found online.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Passwords[CR]Enter the following passwords at the CONTINUE screen...[CR](NOTE-the 21st character of all codes is a zero)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Money[CR]At the beginning of the game, when the king gives you 1500 gold, spend it all(so you have 0 gold) and go back to him. He will give you another 1500 gold. Repeat as necessary</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Field Combat is a vertical-scrolling shoot-em-up that plays like Capcom's Commando. It was developed by TOSE and published by Jaleco for both the Arcade and Nintendo Famicom, neither of which saw a release outside of Japan. The Famicom version would be rereleased years later on the Wii Shop's Virtual Console.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players steer the UFO-like Genesis ship towards the top of the stage, where the enemy's artillery awaits. On the way, the Genesis is accosted by the enemy armies, in red, and can send out their own units, in blue, to assist them in combat. Additionally, the Genesis can fire destructive rockets and also a grapple beam which, if it grabs an enemy, will capture them and turn them to the blue side. Destroying the enemy's artillery allows the player to move onto the next stage.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]History:[/B][CR]In 1987 a small and struggling video game company called Square put all their remaining resources entirely into the hands of the Director of Planning and Development named Hironobu Sakaguchi. They earnestly hoped that whatever game he made would be a hit. As Hironobu was convinced this would be his last game ever, he called it Final Fantasy.[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Opening text. [CR]Final Fantasy is a single player role-playing game (RPG) which lets the player control four characters called the "Light Warriors." They begin by rescuing a princess from the Notorious Knight Garland. Soon after, they are given the world spanning task of collecting four Orbs of Light and defeating four fiends. The fiends went by the names of Lich, Kary, Kraken, and Tiamat. They had taken the Orbs from the rightful place they belonged and spread corruption over all the lands, skies, and seas. After many battles the Light warriors had collected items, gold and experience. When all the fiends were defeated, it was revealed that they took Garland&#8217;s corpse and sent it back in time. He had now become a mass of living evil known as Chaos. Confusingly Chaos sent the four fiends into the future where they currently plagued the world. Only when Chaos was defeated in the past and the four fiends were defeated in the present, was the world's natural balance finally restored.[CR]Final Fantasy was originally considered overbearingly difficult. Saves only came at resting in a Town&#8217;s Inn or using an expensive item known as a House. Spells in the late game cost more than half a million gil, and had a limited number of charges that could only be replenished by resting. Monster encounters could go from simplistic to overpowering at a moment&#8217;s notice.[CR]Battle System[CR] Fighting wolves in the MSX version.[CR]Attacks were played out in turn based combat. All characters and monsters all were told what to do before the round began, be it cast a spell, use an item, or commit a basic attack, and all actions were then played out from the fastest person on the battlefield to the slowest. In the original game, some attacks could be useless. For example, if a Fighter and a Thief were both instructed to attack a goblin they would both do so. If the Thief killed him, it wouldn't stop the fighter from doing exactly as he was told by swinging his sword at the space the goblin once stood instead of at the other enemies present. This was later altered in the re-releases for the PSOne, Game Boy Advance, PSP, and iPhone versions, so the attacker would automatically attack the next available target.[CR]Innovation[CR] Crafting a party from six available classes. Pictured is the default party setup: Fi, Th, BB, RM.[CR]The player chose their party of four with some combination of Black Mage, White Mage, Red Mage, Thief, Fighter, and Black Belt characters. These classes could be upgraded by the Dragon King, to; White Wizard, Black Wizard, Red Wizard, Ninja, Knight, and Master. Players traveled the world in vehicles, such as; boats, airships, and canoes. In combat, up to 9 monsters of various types could battle the player's party. Unless they soared through the skies in an airship or strolled in a safe area like a town, 'random encounters' were always possible. In these Encounters, a band of monsters could emerge and strike the party. Mages had a limited amount of spells they could learn.[CR]Final Fantasy had almost 20 musical tracks. Some of which, like the tune played after 'Victorious battle' and the 'Opening Theme', remained in one form or another in Final Fantasy games for decades to come.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]The music for Final Fantasy was composed by Nobuo Uematsu. Some of the tracks became the trademarks to the Final Fantasy series: like the "Prelude", played on the title screen, and the "Victory Fanfare", which is played after every victorious battle.[CR]Version Differences[CR]Wonderswan and PlayStation[CR]The PSOne release of Final Fantasy was under the title of Final Fantasy Origins and contained enhanced remakes of both Final Fantasy I and II using higher quality MIDI and cleaner 16-bit graphics. These enhanced remakes were initially ports of the Wonderswan re-releases that never made it to the US for various reasons, most notably because the Wonderswan Color was never released in the US. Aside from the obvious graphical face-lift, various changes exist in the PSOne version that differ from the original NES version. An easy mode was created for the original Final Fantasy (increased Gil and EXP curves), auto-re-targeting, a temporary quicksave, and the addition of new items such as Phoenix Downs (revive a fallen ally) and Gold Needles (remove petrification).Game Boy Advance[CR]Using the same enhanced graphical look of the PSOne release, the Gameboy Advance release of Final Fantasy, known as Dawn of Souls, was most notable for drastically reducing the difficulty. The version also included bonus dungeons for each game, though the complex battle transitions and music quality were reduced due to the technical limitations of the system. All changes to the battle system of the PSOne release carry over, however the magic system (previously levels of magic "slots" with limited number of uses) was changed to use Magic Points instead. Speculative reasons for the changes include Nintendo's fear that an overly difficult RPG would turn away the younger player-base, arguably a larger portion of the overall audience than on the PSOne.PSP[CR]The PSP re-release featured the same difficulty reduction and added bonus dungeons of the Gameboy Advance re-release, but featured an even bigger graphical overhaul, with various post-processing effects added such as cloud overcast and hi-res sprites (including spells). However, unlike Origins and Dawn of Souls, these two versions were not sold together and retailed individually at release for $29.99 USD each. Together, these two releases doubled the price of the initial release of both Final Fantasy Origins and Dawn of Souls ($29.99). The price, in addition to the numerous other re-releases of the games on other platforms, resulted in the game receiving much criticism from the gaming press.iPhone Giant D-Pad[CR]On February 25, 2010, Square-Enix released an updated version of this game onto the iPhone and iPod Touch. Retailing for $8.99, it is essentially a port of the PSP version of the game. The graphics are higher resolution than the Dawn of Souls remake, and are essentially on-par with the sprites seen in the PSP version. In addition, the Soul of Chaos, Labyrinth of Time, and the 4 special element-based dungeons are also included (which are unlocked after defeating one of the four Elemental Masters). The game immediately rocketed up to the #2 spot on the Top Grossing Apps list. Big Buttons for easy pressingness[CR]The game has a specialized control scheme for the touch screen. The overworld has a simple D-pad overlay, and the battles are equipped with some large buttons and a simple tapping interface to select what action to perform and which enemy to perform it on. This is a highly efficient method for playing the game, but whereas in other games the player could just hold a button down to skip past the battles, it requires continued taps in this version, which can actually slow down the game. It currently sits around 4.5 stars on iTunes.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hidden Puzzle Game[CR]When you're on the ship, hold down the A button and press the B button 55 times to access the hidden puzzle game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret Invisible Guard.[CR]In the first castle, there is what appears to be an empty space right above Queen Jane's room and below the person going right and left. Check the lower right corner of this area to find out that there is an invisible person here. Talk to him and he will tell you something before and after you save Princess Sarah.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] World Map[CR]While on the world map, press B and Select at the same time, and you will see the world map.</plot>

				<plot>Hey, um, it's Final Fantasy! And if that wasn't good enough, there's also Final Fantasy 2! Granted, it's not enough to get anyone excited in the Emulation Age, but this would be quite a worthy purchase back in the day. I mean, who would pay full price for Final Fantasy 2? This way, at least you get the FF1 with it too.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]Anyway, this isn't too exciting, just the official Final Fantasy translation and the Neo Demiforce Final Fantasy 2 translation. That's all. There was going to be a new intro for the game, but it never happened, so here we are.

By pressing Select and B simultaneously (it must simultaneous or the Row screen will appear instead), you will be able to see a globular view of the Final Fantasy II world.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Much like in Final Fantasy I, the overworld in Final Fantasy II is divided into square regions, with each region having a preset list of possible enemy encounters. Also akin to FFI, the geography of the FFII overworld, alongside this division innto square regions for enemy encounters, leads to a glitch early in the game. If you go due south of Altea and to the end of the peninsula there, and walk back and forth along its southern tip, you will fight against enemies not normally found in this area: instead, they are generally found in the area around Mysidia, which is much further ahead in the game. This can make it easier to quickly earn Gil and weapon/magic levels, although the battles are much tougher than normal, so be careful![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In the southwestern corner of Fynn, when the cyclone appears and destroys much of the overworld, you can speak a man inside a house about the cyclone. As a result, you'll receive several items, including the Blood Sword. The Blood Sword is what would seem to be a terrible item, boosting no stats whatsoever when equipped. However, it is capable of making two bosses much easier to win because, when used, the Blood Sword will deal extremely heavy amounts of damage to them. Those bosses are both against the Emperor in the Cyclone and in Palamecium. There is nothing special that must be done to draw out this hidden property of the Blood Sword: simply equip it and use it.</plot>

				<title_clean>Final Fantasy II</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Battle from the Famicom version.[CR]Final Fantasy II is a sequel to Square's Final Fantasy and was only released in Japan on the Famicom in 1988. An English-language NES release was originally planned under the title "Shadow of Palamecia", but it was never completed. The game has since then been remade on various other platforms including the WonderSwan Color, PlayStation, PSP, Game Boy Advance and iPhone. The game does not share any connection with the original Final Fantasy's world or characters, establishing a precedent all entries in the primary Final Fantasy series have since followed.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Beavers are crucial to the story of Final Fantasy II.[CR]Final Fantasy II is about four heroes, including main protagonist Firion, who join a resistance group called Wild Rose and try to stop the Empire of Palamecia from taking over the world. The dialogue in Final Fantasy II is a lot more dynamic than the first; players can ask NPCs about key terms and items to advance the plot or unlock certain events. It is also the first Final Fantasy where party members can join and leave the party during the game. Final Fantasy II also introduced elements that have since become defining concepts of the Final Fantasy series. It is the first game to feature the chocobo, a mount that would let the player ride across the world without any random encounters, and a character named Cid.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Battle scene from the PSP remake.[CR]Final Fantasy II's combat and character progression use different systems than were seen in the original game. Instead of gaining experience points to increase in level and raise stats across the board, the heroes gain skill levels for the attributes they use in battle. For example, if they use swords, their strength and sword skill will increase; if they get hit in battle, their hit points will increase.[CR]A glitch in the Famicom version of the game registers canceled stat-boosting commands. If the player were to repeatedly input and cancel a particular command, they could conceivably give the related stats a substantial boost before the end of a single battle. This glitch was fixed in later ports.[CR]Final Fantasy II also introduced the idea of party formation to the franchise. The player could move their characters to the back of the line in battle, reducing their chances of taking damage while limiting their own attack capabilities to using bows or magic.[CR]Version Differences[CR]As stated above, Final Fantasy II has seen numerous iterations since its conception. What follows below are the different versions released over the years and the iterative changes with each subsequent release.Famicom (1988 and 1994)[CR]The original Final Fantasy II was released for the Famicom in Japan and was set to release in North America supposedly with the subtitle Dark Shadow Over Palakia. With the looming release of the Super Nintendo and a long localization process, the 8-bit version never made its way outside of Japan despite the success of the first Final Fantasy and Square advertisements of the beta version. The Famicom version was re-released in Japan as part of a compilation with the first Final Fantasy in 1994. This version still remains exclusive to Japan despite Nintendo's claims that each pre-PlayStation Final Fantasy would be released over its Virtual Console service.WonderSwan Color (2001)[CR]More than a decade after Final Fantasy II's original release, Square decided to put support behind the WonderSwan Color, a Japan handheld gaming device. Along with this support came re-releases of Final Fantasies I, II and III, whose graphics were updated to suit the 16-bit handheld. The game also had fully drawn backgrounds for battle sequences and remastered audio. Final Fantasy II for the WonderSwan was a release title and was also featured in a limited edition bundle. The bundle included the game, a specially branded system and a premium strap with Final Fantasy II branding.PlayStation (2002 and 2003)[CR]Nearly 15 years later, gamers outside of Japan could purchase a version of Final Fantasy representative of their own territory. The PlayStation version added CG cutscenes and featured technical improvements beyond that of the WonderSwan Color version. It was released separately or compiled in Japan and released solely as the compilation Final Fantasy Origins overseas.Mobile Phones (2004 and 2006)[CR]Due to the immense popularity of cell phone gaming in Japan, a mobile phone version was released over three services providers on different dates. The graphics and sound most closely resemble that of the more widely known Game Boy Advance version. This version remains exclusive to Japan.Game Boy Advance (2004)[CR]This version of Final Fantasy II signaled Square's returning support for Nintendo handhelds as well as Final Fantasy II's first official release in the Australia territory. Released under the compilation Final Fantasy I &amp; II: Dawn of Souls, the reworked title also featured a new post-game sequence called Souls of Rebirth, in which players can control the various support characters that died during the main storyline.PlayStation Portable (2007 and 2008)[CR]To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Final Fantasy series, Square-Enix brought Final Fantasy II out of the vault once more for the release of Final Fantasy II Anniversary Edition. It is considered as the ultimate version of Final Fantasy II as it includes all the bonuses from previous versions as well as updated graphics and sound, a rebalanced combat system and two extra dungeons.iPhone (2010)[CR]The iPhone version retains all aspects of the PSP anniversary release. The only main difference between the two versions is the method of control. Whereas the PSP utilizes digital button inputs, the iPhone version is controlled solely by its touch screen interface.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The original soundtrack was composed by Nobuo Uematsu. The remakes of the game have sound produced and arranged by Tsuyoshi Sekito.PlayStation track listing:[CR]1. "Opening Movie"[CR]2. "Opening Movie SE"[CR]3. "Opening Theme"[CR]4. "Prelude"[CR]5. "Battle Scene 1"[CR]6. "Time of Revival"[CR]7. " Reunion"[CR]8. "Rebel Army Theme"[CR]9. "Town"[CR]10. "Main Theme"[CR]11. "Pandemonium Castle"[CR]12. "Imperial Army Theme"[CR]13.

"Finale"[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] View World Map[CR]When you have obtained the Ring from Scott early in the game, there is a hidden effect to it. By pressing Select and B simultaneously (it must simultaneous or the Row screen will appear instead), you will be able to see a globular view of the Final Fantasy II world.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Peninsula of Power[CR]Much like in Final Fantasy I, the overworld in Final Fantasy II is divided into square regions, with each region having a preset list of possible enemy encounters. Also akin to FFI, the geography of the FFII overworld, alongside this division innto square regions for enemy encounters, leads to a glitch early in the game. If you go due south of Altea and to the end of the peninsula there, and walk back and forth along its southern tip, you will fight against enemies not normally found in this area: instead, they are generally found in the area around Mysidia, which is much further ahead in the game. This can make it easier to quickly earn Gil and weapon/magic levels, although the battles are much tougher than normal, so be careful![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] The Blood Sword[CR]In the southwestern corner of Fynn, when the cyclone appears and destroys much of the overworld, you can speak a man inside a house about the cyclone. As a result, you'll receive several items, including the Blood Sword. The Blood Sword is what would seem to be a terrible item, boosting no stats whatsoever when equipped. However, it is capable of making two bosses much easier to win because, when used, the Blood Sword will deal extremely heavy amounts of damage to them. Those bosses are both against the Emperor in the Cyclone and in Palamecium. There is nothing special that must be done to draw out this hidden property of the Blood Sword: simply equip it and use it.</plot>

				<title_clean>Final Fantasy III</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Final Fantasy III is a Japanese roleplaying game originally developed and published for the Nintendo Entertainment System by Square on April 27th, 1990. Although given a 3D remake on the Nintendo DS in 2006, the original NES version has never been published outside of Japan in any officially licensed form. Final Fantasy VI, when it was eventually released in the U.S., would end up being re-branded as "Final Fantasy III" as it was only the third in the series to be published in the states, despite being a completely different game on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The game is set in the floating continent, and puts players in control of four orphans raised by an elder named Topopa in the village of Ur. After an earthquake opens up a hidden cavern in the Altar Cave just outside of their village, the orphans set out to explore what lies within. What they find is a crystal of light which grants them each a portion of its power and instructs them to restore balance to the world.[CR]In the past when the Light was threatening to overtake the world 4 Dark Warriors emerged and cut a swath of destruction. In the present these characters now work for the Light, hopefully to once again restore balance to a world now threatened by the Xande and the Cloud of Darkness--a nihilistic mastermind behind the world&#8217;s descent, and the game&#8217;s ultimate foe.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay of Final Fantasy III is a mixture of both previous titles in the series, with several additions. Common staples of the series and genre in general such as an overworld map, random encounters, dungeon crawling and numerous boss battles all remain prevalent, and central to the game's core experience. New features however, such as summons and the removal of others like the active time battle system, make the game distinct in comparison.Combat[CR]Combat in the game is primarily turn-based as was the case with both the earlier games, only without the ATB system. The biggest technical improvement over the original system however is the inclusion of an auto-targeting mechanic for physical attacks which frees players from having to worry about missing a hit completely because the enemy had been killed in a previously queued battle command. This would also later be applied to magical attacks in subsequent games. Another change lies in the graphical display of damage to characters which instead of being shown as a caption, instead are shown above the respective characters' sprites.Experience &amp; Jobs[CR]Although scrapped as a feature in Final Fantasy II, the experience system introduced in the first game makes a return, along with a completely re-tooled character class system also absent from the second game which would prove to be permanent fixtures in the series.[CR]In Final Fantasy III, players are given a "job system" which essentially allows characters to switch between different classes at any time. Although all four of the player characters begin as a rudimentary class named "Onion Knight", additional and more complex classes are unlocked throughout the game by collecting crystals and can be applied to any of the four characters so long as they have saved enough "capacity points" acquired through battle to do so.[CR]As players earn experience, they also become more proficient with whatever job they have currently equipped. Higher level jobs increase battle statistics of characters, reduce the cost of switching to the job, and increase the effectiveness of specialised weaponry, armor, accessories and spells utilized by the class. Jobs also allow characters to use special innate abilities like the Thief's ability to open secret passages, or battle commands such as Steal which allows players to gain extra loot from battles.Summons[CR]Final Fantasy III is the first game in the series to feature creatures which can be summoned at any time to deal high-level damage to enemies. Summons can be bought in stores, but also defeated in combat and bent to the party&#8217;s service. Several of these creatures include Shiva, Ifrit and Bahamut. Similarly, this is the first in the series to feature friendly helper creatures named moogles, a now prominent staple of the franchise.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Copy Magic &amp; Unlimited Gil[CR]Requirements: Sight and a white magic user [CR]Give Sight to a character that can use it along with the spells you want to duplicate. In the Magic menu remove the spells that you want duplicated and use Sight without leaving that menu. Now you should still have the spells in the Magic menu and a copy in the Item menu. For unlimited Gil copy and sell expensive spells.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret Message[CR]Hold Up-Left + Select + Start and Power On the console. At the black screen, release the Select button to see the hidden message.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Free Elixers[CR]After you defeat the Death Wizard, return to Argas Castle. Switch your white mage to the front of your party and open the locked doors. In one of the doors is another white mage. Talk to him to get elixirs.</plot>

				<plot>Final Lap by Namco is considered by many to be the spiritual successor to Pole Position. This fairly straightforward Formula 1 racing game features a one or two player mode which is raced via split-screen. Up to eight players can take turns playing in a tournament mode. [CR]The initial race takes place on an oval track in New York while subsequent tracks with more challenging turns and corners will take players all over the world; from Mexico to Monaco. Each car can be upgraded before a race with allotted points to customize the tires, engine, brakes, and nitro. Nitro is kicked in by pressing up on the control pad. Colliding into competitors will bump your car back but sliding into billboards on the side can cause your vehicle to spin out.</plot>

				<title_clean>Fire Emblem - Ankoku Ryuu to Hikari no Tsurugi</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ryu to Hikari no Tsurugi ( translated as Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light in Super Smash Bros. Brawl) is the first game in the Fire Emblem franchise. Released on April 20, 1990 in Japan for the Nintendo Famicom, it marks the debut of series protagonist Marth. The game is credited with spawning the Strategy RPG genre and has seen numerous sequels, including two remakes in Fire Emblem: Monsho no Nazo for the Super Famicom and Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon for the Nintendo DS.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game's storyline focuses on Prince Marth of Altea, descendent of the warrior Anri who defeated the evil Medeus. When Gra, a close ally of Altea betrays the Altean army and allies with the nation of Dolhr, Marth is forced to become an exile in the neighboring nation of Talys, and his sister Elice is taken hostage after their father is killed battling the evil pontifex Gharnef. After living in Talys for several years, Marth grows into a resilient young man, and with the help of his allies, he embarks on a quest to reclaim his family's sacred sword Falchion, rescue Elice, and reclaim Altea from the clutches of Gharnef.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ryu to Hikari no Tsurugi is one of the first strategy RPGs released for home consoles, if not the very first. The game shares many features with traditional console RPGs such as experience points, leveling up, and using gold to purchase new equipment for units. The game is divided into a series of chapters, each centered around a specific battle. The player must select units to put in play and move them about a map grid to defeat enemies and accomplish mission objectives. Ankoku Ryu to Hikari no Tsurugi also established the series staple mechanic of permanent character death. Should a unit's hit points drop to zero during battle, he or she will die and be gone forever. In the event that this occurs, the only way for the player to recover the dead character is to reset the game and start the mission over. The only exception to this rule is in the use of the Aum Staff, a special limited-use item acquired late in the game. This staff can only be used by Elice during the game's final chapter, and it is only capable of returning a single player-character that has died to life before it breaks.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound test[CR]After finishing a battle and saving your game, select the "don't continue" option to end the current game. After that, press Up, Down, Left, Right, Up and A to enter the sound test mode.</plot>

				<title_clean>Fire Emblem Gaiden</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Fire Emblem Gaiden is the second entry in the Fire Emblem series of strategy RPGs. Set in the same game world as it's predecessor, the events of Fire Emblem Gaiden actually take place on a different continent and thus have no bearing on the first game's narrative. However, several characters from the original game do make return appearances. Released two years after the first Fire Emblem, Gaiden is the second and last game in the series to be released on the Nintendo Famicom.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The game follows two protagonists, life-long friends Alm and Celica, over the course of five chapters and takes place in two kingdoms on the continent of Valencia: Rigel and Sofia. The world map is slowly revealed for players to traverse through the game's five chapters. Over the course of the game, it is revealed to both Alm and the player that he is actually the prince of Rigel, whereas Celica is both the princess of Sofia and a priestess of the goddess Mila. Fire Emblem Gaiden was the first game in the series where more than one main character could promote. Alm begins the game as a Fighter before eventually promoting to Hero. Celica is a Priestess, and she promotes into Princess.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]While keeping the main formula intact, Gaiden added a series of major and minor changes to the gameplay. The most notable of which is the addition of branching classes. Players have the option of multiple classes to choose from when promoting characters. Also, spells in the game are not considered weapons; they are instead learned by leveling characters up. Main weapons never break and only special weapons have the need to be equipped.[CR]While the number of differences with the original Fire Emblem's gameplay was large, the following titles reverted to the first game's formula to focus more on strategy. However, both Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones and Fire Emblem: Awakening both feature overworld maps and branching promotion systems much like the ones seen in Gaiden.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]At the title screen (which you can't skip to) press Up, Down, Left, Right, Up and you will enter Sound Mode automaticly, which holds every noise and song in the game, along with some choices that produce nothing.</plot>

				<title_clean>Flappy</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Flappy is an early computer game from Japanese developers dB Soft that resembles a cross between Sokoban's very deliberate box-pushing puzzling with Boulder Dash's (or Namco's Dig Dug) gravity-enforced boulder-dropping.[CR]Flappy was originally released on Japanese home computer the Sharp X1 in 1983. It was later released on many other home systems around the same time. In 1985, it was ported to the MSX PC line and the Famicom, becoming dB-Soft's first release for Nintendo's fledgling system. The Famicom version would also be rereleased years later on the Wii Shop's Virtual Console.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players, as Flappy, must push a blue-colored boulder onto a similarly colored platform using the level design and other, brown-colored boulders as support. Flappy can push boulders and even destroy the regular variants, but eliminating them can often mean being unable to complete a stage. As well as figuring out the solution, Flappy must avoid enemies throughout the stage, though they can be temporarily stunned by picking up and throwing special mushrooms lying around and also squished permanently by dropping boulders on them. Of course, Flappy can also be killed if a boulder falls on his head or comes into contact with the enemies. The player has a set number of lives and once they've all gone, the game is over.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] All passwords[CR]Press Select button on the title screen and then enter one of the following passwords.</plot>

				<title_clean>Fleet Commander</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Fleet Commander is a war strategy game that allows the player to stage large-scale naval battles with an enemy force. Though not explicitly stated, the battle scenario is reminiscent of a major campaign between Japan and the USA navies in the Pacific Theater of Operations during WW2.[CR]ASCII, a prolific developer and publisher of computer games, created Fleet Commander for the NES and included with it several "feelies" of the type usually found packaged with PC games. They included a large map of the game's battle zone and an assortment of plastic ship figures that the player could use to keep track of their fleet's movements.[CR]The game was also packaged with a Turbo File periphery which, like the Famicom Disk System, allowed players to make save files for later use. The Turbo File would also be used for several other games, though it never left Japan.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The Flintstones and the Rubbles were enjoying a fine day when suddenly, someone from the future called Dr. Butler arrived and stole their pets, Dino and Hoppy!  Butler plans to feature the pets in his intergalactic zoo, and what's worse, he's destroyed the Great Gazoo's time machine so that no-one could stop him!  It's up to everyone's favourite caveman, Fred Flintstone, to find the pieces to the time machine and repair it, so that they can travel to the future and confront Dr. Butler once and for all![CR]The Flintstones: The Rescue of Dino &amp; Hoppy is a side-scrolling platformer for the NES.  In it, you control Fred Flintstone through various locations such as Bedrock, Reef Rock, the Jungle and more as he searches for the missing pieces of Gazoo's time machine.  Fred has his trusty club which he can use to attack with, or charge up it's power by holding B for a more deadly attack.  Fred can collect coins after defeating enemies, which are used to pay for secondary weapons like slingshots and tomahawks, as well as special abilities such as flying and diving.[CR]After completing the first level, the player is presented with an overworld map that allows you to choose which level you'd like to go to.  There are also basketball courts on the map - if you beat your opponent in a game of basketball, you can earn one of the special abilities which are required for use later.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Debug Menu (Japanese version)[CR]At the title screen, after "press start" has started flashing, press A, B, A, B, Up, Right, Right, Right, Down, Down, Down, Down, Left, Left and Start .

				<title_clean>Formation Z</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Formation Z was initially an Arcade game, created by Jaleco in 1984. It was eventually ported to MSX and Famicom, with the Famicom version reappearing in the PS1 compilation Jaleco Collection Vol 1 and on the Wii Shop's Virtual Console. It is thought to be the earliest game in which the player could transform between a robot mode and a vehicle mode: Future games that would use this concept include Square's Thexder and, of course, Takara's various Transformers games.[CR]In the game, the player could run across the ground in their robot mode, or take to the skies as a jet with limited fuel. The game scrolled a lot faster as the jet, though the player was also more maneuverable to compensate. In some cases, one of the two modes would be inaccessible, so the player would be required to switch occasionally. Formation Z is notable for being one of the first horizontal-scrolling shoot-em-ups to have some degree of vertical scrolling as well, as the jet could take to the skies far above the ground.[CR]Formation Z was the second game Jaleco ever published for the NES, following their earlier Arcade conversion of Exerion. In both cases, Jaleco used third-party developers to create the NES versions.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Formation Z</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Formation Z was initially an Arcade game, created by Jaleco in 1984. It was eventually ported to MSX and Famicom, with the Famicom version reappearing in the PS1 compilation Jaleco Collection Vol 1 and on the Wii Shop's Virtual Console. It is thought to be the earliest game in which the player could transform between a robot mode and a vehicle mode: Future games that would use this concept include Square's Thexder and, of course, Takara's various Transformers games.[CR]In the game, the player could run across the ground in their robot mode, or take to the skies as a jet with limited fuel. The game scrolled a lot faster as the jet, though the player was also more maneuverable to compensate. In some cases, one of the two modes would be inaccessible, so the player would be required to switch occasionally. Formation Z is notable for being one of the first horizontal-scrolling shoot-em-ups to have some degree of vertical scrolling as well, as the jet could take to the skies far above the ground.[CR]Formation Z was the second game Jaleco ever published for the NES, following their earlier Arcade conversion of Exerion. In both cases, Jaleco used third-party developers to create the NES versions.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Photon: The Ultimate Game on Planet Earth (also known by the title "Hikari no Senshi Foton", meaning "Soldier of Light Photon") is based on the toy license with the equally grandiose title that would later be rebranded as Laser Tag.[CR]It is a 3D maze game like Wizardry and many other computer games of the period, though instead of an RPG the game is a shooter. It was never released outside of Japan, despite Photon being a US trademark.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The goal is to explore the maze, including its many floors, while shooting down the alien creatures and finding items to help the main character's quest. The player can move up or to the sides, provided those directions are not blocked by a wall. When turning left or right, the next screen will still face forward but the player will have turned 90 degrees. Items like the compass and counter should help the player from getting too lost, as much of the maze looks identical.[CR]The player has a maximum of 1000 hit points, though this can be increased with a specific item that appears three times, to a maximum of 9999. They can be recovered by shooting the alien attackers as they pass by.ItemsLoader: A rectangular device with green markings. Necessary to play the disks that can be found.Disk: A rectangle with red markings. There are 12 disks and each one contains a useful hint. The loader must be found before any of the disks can be accessed.Counter: A device that allows the player to view their co-ordinates, helpful for recording sites of interest and exits.Compass: A device that tells the player which direction the screen is pointing towards.Sensor: A device that makes finding secret walls easier.Card: Necessary to open certain doors.Teleporter and Marker: The teleporter device allows the player to instantly move to where the marker is. The marker can be collected and placed wherever the player chooses.Yellow Stone: A yellowish diamond. Needed to traverse yellow vertical shafts. Without the right stone, the player will simply plummet down these shafts to the bottom floor.Green Stone: A green diamond. Works the same as the Yellow Stone, but for green shafts.Red Stone: A red diamond. Works the same as the Yellow and Green stones.Photo Stone: A diamond of many colors. Will permanently increase the player's health.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Front Line is a vertical-scrolling run and gun from Taito in which the player controls a single soldier sent against an entire army. The player can shoot in eight directions, as can most of the enemies, and some amount of cautious advancement is required in order to survive to the end of the level, after which the player will rescue a POW and move onto the next level.[CR]The game is historically significant as being the first vertical-scrolling run and gun. Future games of this format that would go on to receive a lot more critical acclaim and attention from gamers include Commando, Ikari Warriors and Guerrilla War. Ikari Warriors, especially, borrowed a lot from Front Line, including being able to drive tanks and having to leave said tanks before they explode after they receive too much damage.[CR]It was the fourth of Taito's Arcade conversions for the Nintendo Famicom, after Space Invaders, Chack'n Pop and Elevator Action.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Fuzzical Fighter</title_clean>
				<plot>The WakdHacks homepage describes Fuzzical Fighter as an RPG/Action game mix. That's completely wrong, but it shouldn't hinder your enjoyment of the game. You can think of it as a side-scrolling shooter with RPG elements. As you fly around shooting stuff, you get money, which can be used between stages. You can buy new weapons or shields or engines, or you can heal yourself, or even warp to another stage if you so choose. The formula works wonderfully in this case, and while it's not a completely new concept nowadays (Tyrian's one of my favorite PC games (too bad it won't work on my computer anymore)), I'm sure that it seemed quite cool at the time, and it's still great fun to play.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]What's to say?

				<title_clean>Galaga</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released in 1981, Galaga has become one of the most popular arcade games of all time. Much more well received than its predecessor, Galaxian, Galaga features fast paced top-down shooting action. The player takes control of a small ship located at the bottom of the screen and is tasked with destroying the incoming waves of insect-like enemies.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Tractor-beam[CR]The player controls a "fighter" spaceship whose movement is restricted to flying left or right. Upon the start of a level, waves of enemies fly in formation and complete a flight pattern before positioning themselves at the top of the screen. It is ideal to destroy the incoming ships before they complete their fly-in. Once in formation at the top of the screen, enemies will regularly break off to attack. Enemy ships attack by dropping bombs and/or attempting to collide with the player's ship.[CR]The most popular and effective strategy is for the player to sacrifice their own ship to a "Boss Galaga" ship. These ships hover above the player and emit a tractor-beam. Entering this beam will sacrifice the current ship and allow the player to use one of the reserves. Destroying the "Boss Galaga" will reclaim the captured ship. The player is then rewarded with dual ships which effectively doubles the player's firepower.[CR]Additionally, a bonus stage occurs every four levels, allowing the player to earn extra points without the risk of being destroyed. Upon destroying every fighter during a bonus stage, the player will then be rewarded with an extra life.[CR]Galaga in Mass Media[CR]1982 - Actor Matthew Broderick spent two months playing Galaga to prepare for his upcoming role in Wargames.2004 - The ABC television series Lost names a DHARMA Initiative submarine after the popular video game.2009 - Fans are able to purchase a Galaga arcade-style video game Christmas ornament (complete with audibles) thanks to Hallmark.2012 - In Marvel's The Avengers, Tony Stark catches a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent playing Galaga. The agent denies it but after the main characters leave the room he goes back to playing the game. The game footage shown on the computer screen is from the MSX port.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Double-Fire Ship (or 1,000 Points)[CR]This trick concerns the Galaga enemies at the top of the screen - they normally only arrive in quantities or four and are the only enemies able to take two hits, switching to blue after the first. One of their attacks - which won't occur if too few (2~5) enemies are left - is to use a tractor beam to get your ship. This initially causes a loss of life, implying this is bad. Actually, this is good - if you shoot down the Galaga that took your ship while it is diving for another attack, then you will be able to recapture that ship and fire two missiles at once, and take two hits before another loss of life. (If you shoot the ship, it gives you a bonus 1,000 points instead. You can shoot the ship at any time. Just note that if you hit the Galaga while it's not actively moving, then the ship will attack you!)</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Galaxian (&#12462;&#12515;&#12521;&#12463;&#12471;&#12450;&#12531;) is an Arcade game that was developed by Namco and released in October 1979. It was published by Namco in Japan and imported to North America by Midway that December. A vertical scrolling shooter game in which the player controls a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, and shoots enemies descending in various directions, it was designed to compete with Taito's successful earlier game Space Invaders (which was released in the previous year, and also imported to the US by Midway).[CR]The game was a big hit for Namco upon its release, and has been a focus of competitive gaming ever since.[CR]It was ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, ColecoVision, Bally Astrocade, Nintendo Famicom, and home computers.[CR]It spawned a successful sequel, Galaga, in 1981, and the lesser known Gaplus and Galaga '88 in 1984 and 1987 respectively, as well as many later ports and adaptations. Along with its immediate sequel, it was one of the most popular games during the golden age of Arcade video games.[CR][B]Description:[/B][CR]Galaxian expanded on the formula pioneered by Space Invaders. As in the earlier game, Galaxian features a horde of attacking aliens that exchanged shots with the player. In contrast to Space Invaders, Galaxianadded an element of drama by having the aliens periodically make kamikaze-like dives at the player's ship, the Galaxip. This made it the first game to feature enemies with individual personalities. The game's plot consists of a title screen that displayed the message "WE ARE THE GALAXIANS / MISSION: DESTROY ALIENS".[CR]Galaxian was very successful for Namco and introduced several "firsts". Although not the first color video game, Galaxian took RGB color graphics a step further with multi-colored animated sprites and explosions, different colored fonts for the score and high score, the vertical scrolling starfield, and graphic icons that show the number of lives left and how many stages the player had completed. It also features a crude theme song and more prominent background music/sound effects. These elements combine to create a look and feel that would set the standard for arcade games in the 1980s such as Pac-Man.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The objective is destroy endless 'waves' of enemies. The enemy ships are arranged in a formation at the top of the screen. At regular intervals enemy ships on the sides of the formation swoop down and shoot at the player. There are 4 different types of enemy ship, each type behaves differently on its attacking run.[CR]The player must destroy all ships in a wave to complete it. With a minor exception that one yellow ship may disappear after a bombing run and will appear as an extra yellow ship in the following wave. The yellow ships attack in a formation with two red ships, the order these three are destroyed determines the points awarded for destroying the yellow. The maximum is 800 points if the two reds are destroyed first. Once a wave has been completed a red flag is added to the bottom of the screen. When 10 flags are accumulated they are replaced by a larger flag.[CR]The player has 3 lives at the beginning of the game. A bonus life is awarded when the player reaches a score of 7000 points. Once all lives have been lost the game ends. The player can only have one shot on screen at one time. This means if the player misses he must wait until the shot leaves the top of the screen to fire again. This makes accuracy very important.High Score[CR]The current world record score for Galaxian is 1,653,270 points.[CR]Development and Release[CR]The game was developed by Namco in 1979, and released in Japan that year. It was designed to build and improve upon the formula of Taito's game Space Invaders, which revolutionized the gaming industry upon its release a year earlier. Galaxian incorporated new technology into its dedicated arcade system board, the Namco Galaxian. Unlike Space Invaders, which was black &amp; white and featured enemies that could only move vertically and horizontally as they descended, Galaxian had a color screen and enemies that descended in patterns and came from various directions. The result was more complex and difficult game play.[CR]In 1980, Namco partnered with the American company Midway to release the game in North America. Midway had previously published Space Invaders in the market, but had to seek new foreign partners when Taito decided to market their games themselves.[CR]Reception of Ports[CR]Home Computing Weekly in 1983 gave the Spectrum version of Galaxian 3/5 stars describing it as a well-written version and praising the graphics as fast although flickery. Softline in 1983 criticized the Atari 8-bit version of the game for being shipped on cartridge, which raised its cost, and stated that "this game becomes tedious very quickly". Famicom Ts&#363;shin in 1995 scored the Game Boy version of the game a 24 out of 40.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Galaxian has spawned several follow-up games. The most popular of these was its immediate successor, Galaga, which largely eclipsed its predecessor in popularity, introducing aliens attacking in intricate formations, multiple shots, and bonus stages. A third official sequel, Gaplus, was released in 1984. As with Galaga, this was a fixed shooter, with limited vertical movement. However, by 1984, the novelty of the Space Invaders formula had faded, and it was no longer successful. A fourth sequel, Galaga '88, was released in 1987, and imported to North America by Atari Games. Namco then released Galaxian 3 in 1990. A final sequel, Galaga Arrangement, was released as part of the Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1, in 1995.Ports[CR]The original arcade version of Galaxian has been ported to many different systems. These include:Apple IIAtari 400/800Atari 2600Atari 5200Bally Astrocade (Galactic Invasion)Coleco VFD table topColecoVisionCommodore VIC-20Commodore 64DreamcastGame Boy (bundled with its direct successor, Galaga)IBM PCMobile JavaMSX (Europe and Japan only)NEC PC-8801Nintendo Famicom Disk System (Japan only)Sharp X1Virtual Console (Japan only)ZX Spectrum[CR]Coleco also released stand-alone Mini-Arcade tabeletop versions of Galaxian, which, along with Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, and Frogger, sold three million units combined. A port for the Game Boy Color was planned, but never released.Moon Alien Part 2[CR]Nichibutsu released a modified version of this game for the arcades as Moon Alien Part 2. Besides the graphics, the only main difference between this and Galaxian is the inclusion of an energy meter that drains with every second the player spends clearing a wave. If the player doesn't clear the wave before running out of energy, the ship is destroyed.Arcade sequels[CR]Main: Galaxian (franchise)[CR] Galaga (1981)Gaplus (1984)Galaga '88 (1987)Galaga Arrangement (1995) - released as part of Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1[CR]Galaxian was one of the most widely pirated motherboards during the early '80s. Numerous hacks were made of the game and featured slightly redesigned enemy characters and special bonus stages.

				<plot>This is a pretty interesting game. You can use it to pretty much create your own scrolling shooter game. It's pretty simple: you go in and create a title screen, soome enemy and player sprites using a fairly simple editor, then design your map and place the enemies. It was probably one of the first "Make your own ... "-type-game. You should also note that it comes with a pre-made game, however it is insanely difficult![CR]Translation Description:[CR]This patch translates all of the menus, and well .. everything.

				<title_clean>Ganbare Goemon 2</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ganbare Goemon 2 is the sequel to the first Ganbare Goemon and retains many of its core elements, such as its Double Dragon-style field depth, the three "pass" system that requires careful exploration of each stage before the player can proceed to next and Goemon's propensity for daring heists, the proceeds of which are then donated to the poor townspeople. Further emphasized in this game is the series' trademark odd sense of humor, which would continue to be exaggerated even further with future sequels.[CR]The biggest change is the addition of effete overweight ninja Ebisumaru, Goemon's best friend and partner in crime and, crucially to the game, the second player character. He would continue to be a major presence in every subsequent Ganbare Goemon game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Microphone Secrets[CR]Use the Famicom's 2nd Controller Microphone to cheat the fortune teller into giving you a second fortune. Just walk out and back in and use the microphone when he says "Only one fortune at a time". You can also use the microphone to wake up the sleeping guys you encounter in the game.</plot>

This trick also only works if you have less than 5 Ryou (it costs 5 Ryou to use the Bank to store items). Go there and attempt to deposit the item you wish to copy. You will be stopped since you can not afford the 5 Ryou to do so. Keep pressing A repeatedly and the same message will appear. Each time you go through this message, you will get another of that item. When you leave the place without depositing anything, check your inventory to find your duplicate items!</plot>

				<title_clean>Ganbare Goemon! - Karakuri Douchuu</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Though not the first Konami game to feature a character based on historical Japanese figure Goemon Ishikawa, which would be the Arcade platformer Mr Goemon, Ganbare Goemon! Karakuri Douchuu is the first Ganbare Goemon game in a long-running series known in the West as The Legend of Mystical Ninja. The game establishes many of the most identifiable aspects of the series: The top-down, 3/4 perspective; Goemon's use of a pipe and a yoyo as weapons; buying items in stores with found money, such as armor and health replenishing items; the 3D maze sequences; and the "lucky cat" Maneki Neko power-ups that increase the power of Goemon's weapon.[CR]The goal of each stage in Karakuri Douchuu is to find three passes. These allow Goemon to pass the gates to the next area of the game and can be found in secret tunnels, in the 3D mazes that can be reached from some shops or purchased in said shops for a considerable fee. All the while, Goemon needs to avoid or defeat enemies such as samurai, policemen, ronin, ninjas and oni.[CR]Though an obvious progenitor to the series, it wouldn't be until the second game - which introduces Ganbare Goemon's trademark bizarre sense of humor and Goemon's partner Ebisumaru - that the Ganbare Goemon series becomes whole.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Special Continue[CR]At the game over screen, hold button A and B and then press Start. If done right, you'll continue on the same stage you were in and you'll keep your energy bar, but half the money.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] CRC Test[CR]Hold B + A while turning on the power or reset to start the CRC test.</plot>

				<title_clean>Ganso Saiyuuki - Super Monkey Daibouken</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ganso Saiyuuki: Super Monkey Daibouken is an action RPG for the NES and was published by Vap and developed by an unknown developer. It focuses on the story depicted in Journey to the West, where the deposed demi-god Sun Wukong (a.k.a. The Monkey King) must escort the Buddhist monk Xuanzang from China to India while ensuring his safety. The player will also locate and recruit Xuanzang's other protectors, such as Zhu Bajie (usually called Pigsy in English translations), as the game progresses.Most of the gameplay involves travelling over vast, empty maps looking for houses and entrances to other areas. Occasionally the player will be tasked with defending Xuanzang from marauding beasts and bandits, and these involve side-scrolling action sections where Sun Wukong and his entourage fight them off. Defeating the enemies (or after enough time has passed) will bring Sun Wukong back to the map. Along the way, the player must search houses for food and water to prevent the party from starving/dehydrating to death.The game has an infamous reputation in Japan for its difficulty, its obfuscating lack of direction and its generally poor sound and graphical quality. It was never released outside its native country. Easter Egg[CR]Within the game there is a hidden explicit message in the tileset from one of the game's programmers. However, it cannot be accessed through normal gameplay.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Select[CR]At the title screen press the following combinations of buttons and then Start:</plot>

				<title_clean>Gegege no Kitarou - Youkai Daimakyou</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ninja Kid is a ninja-themed action platformer from Bandai. However, in Japan, it is called Gegege no Kitarou: Youkai Daimakyou ("Gegege no Kitarou: Great Ghost Haunts of Evil Men") and is based on a manga and anime about a young youkai (Japanese ghost or spirit) trying to prevent an all out war between the youkai and the humans.[CR]Bandai was very much in the licensed game market back in the NES era, and so would produce many games based on popular anime licenses. Though keen to increase sales by publishing the game overseas, Bandai felt the Gegege no Kitarou license had little to no recognition in the States, so they changed a considerable amount of the resources to create a ninja-themed game instead, as ninjas were popular at the time. Bandai's earlier game Chubby Cherub had also undergone a similar process for its localization.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls a ninja going to towers and completing mini games in each tower. Some towers after completing the mini game have a mini boss, which involves climbing to the top of the tower and shooting it in the right spot. There are four types of mini games:Blazing Inferno - A little flame follows Ninja Kid and the player must use it to light all the candles in the level.Poison Field - The player must collect a number of sprites to clear the level.Dog Fight - Ninja Kid is flying on a kite and needs to kill a number of enemies to clear the level.Guerrilla Warfare - The player must simply run around and kill a number of enemies to clear the level.[CR]With each mini game it is always 10 kills, candles or sprites required to clear the level. When all the towers on the map are clear the player can fight the boss in the castle. There are four power ups the player may collect for assistance:A feather that waves around in the air.A ninja star that is strong against bosses.A fire ball that circles any thrown blades.A boomerang-type weapon that doesn't come back.[CR]The game is considered quite challenging due to its 1-hit deaths and no continues.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] CHR RAM and PRG ROM Test[CR]Press and hold any button on the second controller, then press Reset. The game will test PRG and CHR ROMs consistency by 16-bit checksum. If the PRG test fails, then the screen will hang with red color. If the CHR test fails, then the screen will be blue. If both pass, then the game will continue as usual.</plot>

				<title_clean>Gegege no Kitarou 2 - Youkai Gundan no Chousen</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]GeGeGe no Kitarou 2: Youkai Gundan no Chousen ("Spooky Kitaro 2: Kitaro vs. Youkai Army") is the second game produced by Bandai based on the GeGeGe no Kitarou license. Unlike the first game, which was an action platformer (better known to the West as Ninja Kid), GeGeGe no Kitarou 2 is more like a traditional Japanese RPG. The combat is turn-based and menu driven and much of the game involves walking around talking to NPCs and fighting through dungeons.[CR]GeGeGe no Kitarou 2's eponymous hero and youkai (Japanese spirit) Kitaro spends most of his time trying to prevent a war between the humans and the youkai, effectively quelling his more aggressive brethren's antics before they get out of hand.[CR]Though the game was never released outside of Japan, it did receive a fan translation.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]GeGeGe no Kitarou 2's gameplay is that of a simple JRPG: Battles play out in turns, with each character choosing an attack and having each round play out. Though enemies can be encountered in groups, Kitaro only has to fight them one at a time. Likewise, when Kitaro starts recruiting allies, they can fight a round on his behalf rather than combining their efforts.[CR]Though battles are simple, the game itself is rather challenging, due in part to maze-like overworlds between dungeons and the slow rate at which the player accrues experience. Many enemies, especially early on, will drop a single XP (if they don't simply run off after receiving a few attacks) making level-ups an uncommon occurrence. The game also has some odd obstacles, such as many dungeons requiring a light spell (common at the time) and certain regions blocked by "youkai storms" until the player has resolved any quest objectives in the area.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Ready For The Last Castle + Max Exp + All Items[CR]At the password screen, press Right 1 time, Down 1 time and enter the Japanese character.

Tap the B key and you will be in the Yoki Storm area you were not supposed to visit.This is useful in Southwest Japan, to pick up Nurikabe and a Rebirth Potion for the Central Japan quests.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Geimos is a sci-fi shoot-em-up for the Famicom which was never released outside of Japan. It is one of the earliest third-party games for the system that wasn't a conversion of a pre-existing Arcade game or computer game. Though the game is credited to a developed named "Wixel" on its title screen, it's commonly believed that developers-for-hire Micronics were responsible for the game's design. ASCII Entertainment, a prominent producer of Japanese computer games, published the game.[CR]As a shooter, it uses the then-popular Z-axis "pseudo-3D" perspective with which Sega would find later great success in the Arcades with hits like Space Harrier and After Burner. It also uses a feature pioneered in Xevious, in which the player has access to two weapons: One that destroys ground targets and another that destroys air targets. The player needs to use the right weapon to take out incoming enemies.[CR]</plot>

These fights are depicted as one-on-one turn-based struggles where the player and creature's health is depicted as candles. Kagekiyo can regenerate health at shrines by spending money and can also level up stats at torii gates by spending "toku", or virtue. Both money and toku are earned defeating enemies.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Ghostbusters</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Ecto 1[CR]Ghostbusters was designed by David Crane and originally released by Activision in 1984. In the game, players start out by using their limited funds to purchase one of four vehicles, along with additional equipment necessary to catch ghosts. Players then move a Ghostbusters symbol around a map screen, plotting routes to ghost disturbances. At each disturbance, the player controls two Ghostbusters, attempting to use their proton beams to manuever the ghost over the trap they have placed and then catch the ghost. (Notably, only three Ghostbusters are ever depicted in the game, although there are four in the film.) If the player is successful in catching a ghost in the Commodore version, a voice declares "Ghostbusters!" If the player fails to do so, the ghost will slime the player, and a voice will say "He slimed me." All the while, the music consists of a rendition of the Ray Parker, Jr. hit "Ghostbusters" playing repeatedly.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]When the psychokinetic energy in the city reaches a certain level, provided that players have successfully earned some money, the game moves on to the next stage, in which players must sneak past the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man at the Temple of Zuul. In the original computer version, successfully getting two Ghostbusters past Stay-Puft resulted in the player winning the game. (Whether players win or lose, they are provided with an account number they can use to carry their earnings over to their next game, allowing them to purchase better equipment.)[CR]Later versions of the game included additional content. In the Sega Master System version, for instance, slipping past the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man was much easier than in the original computer versions. However, players then had to make their way up the stairs of the haunted apartment building, fending off plate-throwing ghosts, and then defeat Gozer in a brief shoot-out. The NES version had a similar sequence on the staircase, but it was far more difficult due to the odd controls.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 255 Hits on the stairs on stair stage[CR]Get hit 2 times, then open a door with a ghost behind it and instead of dying. You will be granted a total of 255 hits before you next die making this stage easy.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu (usually translated as "Legend of the Galactic Heroes") is a sci-fi themed strategy game in which the player controls a fleet of starships. It is based on the long-running space opera novel series of the same name which has been adapted into various other media such as manga and anime. This early NES version is simply one of many video game incarnations of this franchise, all of which shame the same name.[CR]The goal of the game is to direct the various commanders of the player character's fleet by giving them specific orders. Eventually, the player will be required to direct massive battles between their fleet and the rival empire's.[CR]A NES midi variant of the classical music piece Bolero by Ravel plays throughout, lending the game a suitably operatic feel.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A map of Earth space.[CR]Originally an RPG developed for the PC (specifically the PC-88 and MSX) by Enix, Nintendo itself reprogrammed and ported the game to the Famicom, an unusual move on their part. The game tells the story of Earth's fight against the evil Garm Empire, who are intent on wiping out all humans utterly. The game begins with a recall of all human forces to Earth and the assignment of the player's character to a team with the heroic survivor of Mars, Blue. The game's amusing box art, which has little to do with the game's actual content, is by Go Nagai.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The Hero: The player character. His default name is Kenshirou.Blue: One of the survivors of The Mars Rayieza forces' battle with the Garm Empire, he is assigned to team with the hero at the beginning of the game. He can be a bit goofy but is skilled and knowledgeable.Rimi: A strange girl recovered from a cold sleep capsule on the moon. She has powerful psychic abilities that will aid the player greatly.The feminine holographic persona of the ship's computer. She serves a wide variety of functions and informs the player of stuff earned after battle.Uerai: The despotic ruler of the Garm Empire.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Should someone perish in space, a friendly alien can help![CR]The player controls the actions of Kenshirou and Blue in a typical RPG fashion as they ride in a pair of Rayeizas; the Rayeizas can be upgraded with various equipment found throughout the game. Rimi serves as a sort of "spellcaster", using psychic abilities to help the heroes or damage the enemy; she is incapable of any other actions.Combat against some Garm gablames.[CR]Garm ships are displayed on a viewscreen in front of the player; most of the space travel is portrayed as being on the bridge of a ship. To navigate from one point to another, a "space map" can be selected and the ship can be directed to move from one point to another; a set number of units determine the distance from one point to the next. Depending on the current speed of the ship (which can be increased by various speed boosters) the player may stop at various increments of units and have to select "move" again; this is when encounters are generally initiated. In addition, the player can land on and explore underground areas on a number of planets. This is necessary to advance the game's story. Enemies can also be encountered in these underground areas. Combat remains virtually identical to space combat.[CR]Combat against Garm Space stations serve as psuedo "boss fights"; the player advance through a barrage of fire to get close enough to do battle with the aforementioned stations. It's best to level a bit or get a better engine for the ship before attempting to fight even the weakest of the stations. Later in the game there are also more conventional bosses.Arrival at a space station.[CR]Human space stations serve as places to get passwords to save the game and purchase more missiles and pills.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Final Password[CR]At the password screen, press Right 2 times, Down 3 times and enter the Japanese character.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Goal! is a soccer sim developed by TOSE and published by Jaleco for the NES and was released in all regions. It is not to be confused with Dino Dini's Goal!, a soccer game created by Virgin Games and an unofficial sequel to Kick Off, nor is it to be confused with its SNES sequel Super Goal!, which was released in the US as simply Goal!.[CR]Unlike many soccer games at the time, the game uses an isometric perspective of the field rather than a straight horizontal or vertical view of the pitch. This would become a more common viewpoint in later soccer games, including EA's FIFA series among others.[CR]The game is based on the World Cup international soccer tournament and allows players to choose from national sides only. These sides include:Group A: Argentina, Holland, Denmark, USA.Group B: England, Italy, Japan, France.Group C: Brazil, Spain, Algeria, USSR.Group D: West Germany, Poland, Belgium, Uruguay.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hard Mode[CR]Hold Up + A + B + Select + Start on the first controller and press Reset. After reloading, the title name color will change to blue for the Japanese version, or the title background color will changed to dark blue for the US version.</plot>

				<plot>When the Great War engulfed the world, bringing civilization as we know it to an end, it ushered in a new era of sorcery and magic. The magicians used their magic to keep order, and peace reigned for a hundred years... Until an evil magician named Draygon, seeking to control and dominate his fellow men, began to use his powers for destruction and conquest. To combat Draygon's evil, the other magicians constructed four powerful swords of wind, fire, water and thunder. Used together, the swords would transform into the mightiest weapon ever created: the sword Crystalis. But Draygon seized the weapons and scattered them far and wide throughout the land. Only one hope remained: A young lad, himself a great magician, who had been imprisoned in a cave and frozen during the Great War. Though they knew it might destroy them, the wise magicians pooled all of their powers in an attempt to revive him. When the boy awoke - his mind a blank, even his name forgotten - they had vanished, leaving him to find his destiny in this strange new world. In CRYSTALIS, you play the role of the young magician, making your way through Draygon's hostile land in an effort to locate the weapons you will need to defeat him. Draygon's monsters and black magic will threaten you at every turn, but you must not falter - only you can deliver the world from his scourge of evil![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Cheat Mode (Japan-only)[CR]Press and hold A and B on Controller 1, then turn the console off and on again. After, during gameplay, access the status screen via Start and press A on Controller 2. This enables very quick movement. Press any D-Pad button for invulnerability, all items, all equipment, and max (255) MP as well.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Cheaper Items[CR]First, move the cursor in a shop above or below the item you wish to buy - whichever item you hover over preferably should have a cheaper cost than the item desired. Then press Up or Down on the D-Pad (towards the desired item) and the A Button at exactly the same time - you should buy the item you wanted, at the cost of the item you hovered over!</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Golf was originally released for the Japanese Famicom in 1984, and was the third of Nintendo's mononym first-party sports games for the system after Baseball and Tennis. It was later released in the US in 1985, Europe in 1986 and for the Famicom Disk System in Japan in 1986. It later saw adaptations for the Game Boy and Sharp X1, and was rereleased for e-Reader and on the 3DS eShop. Nintendo's Golf is also present in NES Remix.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game offers single-player stroke play, two-player stroke play, and two-player match play. The player can select a club and initiate a swing. The swing shows a gauge at the bottom of the screen which has to be charged up for the desired power and then subsequently stopped in a narrow area otherwise the ball will curve to the left or the right. Wind direction also affects the flight of the ball.[CR]Putting shows the slope of the green and allows the player to aim with an arrow to compensate for slope. Putting strokes are performed similar to other strokes but only the putter is allowed once on the green. The game does not simulate different cuts of grass or rough: a ball is either on the fairway, in a bunker, on the green, out of bounds, or in the water. If a ball lands out of bounds or in the water the player has to retry the stroke and also takes a penalty stroke. All game modes are played on a single course.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Golf Grand Slam</title_clean>
				<plot>This game was made with the intentions of helping the player improve their golf game. You can practice setting up putts, dealing with wind resistance, choosing a strike point on the golf ball, and other technical aspects of golfing in the two training modes the game offers. Once you feel you have enough experience you can enter the Golf Grand Slam, a tournament against 29 other fictitious pro players.[CR]The game features 4 sets of 14 different golf clubs that you can bring to the course. The golfing is done by lining up a cursor to where you want the ball to land and then choosing the proper golf club, stance, and grip. The last step before taking the swing is finding the correct contact point on the golf ball. The contact point is represented as a dot that scatters around on top of a golf ball icon and you have to try to stop it on the part of the ball where you want your club to make contact with the ball.</plot>

				<title_clean>Goonies</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Goonies is a side-scrolling action-adventure game from Konami that was first released on the Japanese Famicom in 1986 and quickly ported to the Sharp X1, MSX and PC-8801. A Famicom Disk System followed a couple years later: this version was only made available via the Disk Writer service. The game finally saw its US debut with the Arcade adaptation Vs. The Goonies from the PlayChoice-10 range.[CR]The game was followed by a sequel that diverges from the movie's story and is better known to US audiences. The game is not to be confused with the 1985 Datasoft game for the C64, Atari 8-Bit and Spectrum which was closer to The Lost Vikings with its co-operative puzzles.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game features Mikey as he runs around various stages based on locations from the movie - the closed restaurant that the Fratellis use as a hideout, the caverns beneath the restaurant and One-Eyed Willy's pirate ship - saving his friends and recovering keys. In order to progress, Mikey must find three keys and the captive Goonie on each stage. As well as bats, rats and other hostile wildlife, Mikey is being pursued by the three Fratelli family members: they cannot be defeated, but can be stunned temporarily.[CR]Mikey can find power-ups that help him proceed. The most important of these are bombs which destroy walls marked by skulls and reveal keys and captive Goonies behind them. Permanent bonuses like headphones (which prevents Mikey being hurt by Jake Fratelli's opera singing) and a backpack (which allows Mikey to carry two bombs at once) can also be found, but only once and each in a specific stage.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue[CR]At the game over screen, hold Up &amp; A and press Start.</plot>

One by one this crazed mama and her two nutty sons have kidnapped your fellow Goonies, hauling them off to a spooky shack and hiding them in a maze of adventure filled with danger, including the slippery ice cavern, secret underground sea, and eerie attic. Now you're the only Goonie left. The fate of your friends is in your hands. But saving the day won't be easy.

				<title_clean>Gradius II</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Gradius II is Konami's sequel to Gradius, and shares its predecessor's basic set-up: The player controls an upgradeable ship named the Vic Viper as it flies horizontally across a series of enemy-infested terrains, fighting enormous bosses at the end of each stage. The upgrade system has been slightly tweaked, the graphics updated and the levels are completely different, but is otherwise the same Gradius experience.[CR]Among the new additions are the load-out screen, from which the player can choose four distinct weapon load-outs for the Vic Viper that they can experiment with to find the one that best suits their play style. The game also has more boss variety than the first, though some bosses are carried over from Salamander/Life Force, an interim Konami shooter that was heavily inspired by the first Gradius.[CR]Though neither the Arcade version or the original NES home version ever made it to the US (the Arcade version was released in Europe as Vulcan Venture), the NES version would eventually make its way to the US Wii Shop's Virtual Console almost 20 years later.[CR]The MSX/X68000 game, Nemesis 2 (Gradius 2), is a completely different game in every sense.[CR]</plot>

Players have guns and bombs at their disposal to destroy enemies. Guns have unlimited ammunition, and are a player's primary form of attack. Bombs are more powerful, and are used up through use. A player begins the game with three lives. If the player makes contact with an enemy or an enemy projectile, they will lose a life and restart without the powerups they had collected to that point.[CR]Much of the strategy in Gun-Nac emerges from collecting powerups, of which there are several. Powerups are released when enemies are destroyed. There are five types of guns in the game and four types of bombs. These are represented visually as circles around numbers (for guns) or letters (for bombs). By collecting identical weapon powerups in sequence, a player can enhance that weapon's capability. For example, in it's basic form, the starting gun (number "1") simply fires directly ahead of the player. If the player collects more "1" powerups in sequence, however, the gun will start to fire forward, to the sides, and even behind the player. The maximum power of a weapon is reached once five of its powerups have been collected. If a player collects a weapon powerup that is different from the weapon they are currently using, they will immediately switch to the new weapon at it's lowest strength. This means that a player must avoid unwanted powerups in addition to enemies.[CR]Additionally, enemies will sometimes drop a "wing" powerup. This adds improves the capabilities of whatever weapon the player is using and allows the player's ship to endure one extra hit before the player loses a life.The store screen.[CR]It is also possible to buy either a "wing" powerup or additional powerups to the player's current weapon in between stages at a shop screen. The money for these upgrades is dropped by enemies throughout the level like any other powerup.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra Ending Screens (USA version)[CR]First enable the "Non-Death Mode" cheat. But don't turn on any of the cheats. Beat the game and on the ending scenes, before the credits start, press and hold the A &amp; B buttons. If done right, you'll see extra scenes that were cut out from the Japanese version.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Select[CR]When the title screen appears, select the ''Configurate System'' option. Place the Sound Test on #5 and go up to ''Area'' then use the Left and Right buttons to choose your level.</plot>

				<plot>A summer offensive in the year 1999. Never in your military career have you been in such a hot spot, as the world's most threatening power, Sheik Toxic Moron, deploys his arsenal of TechnoScorch Weapons. To achieve total victory over 4 intense levels, you must possess numerous skills, including precision reflexes for air combat, a cut throat mentality for land assaults, the brains to gather secrets from underground informants, and a keen sense for surviving 3-D battle mazes. If you've got the guts to match those skills, then prepare for action. Because it'll really heat up the second you blast across the Sheik's firing line, piloting the world's most advanced super weapon - the Mach 4 Laser Invasion Helijet, which can go from hovering to a six 'G' vertical climb in a heartbeat. From the moment you activate your Vulcan Cannons and Sidewinder Missiles, you'll take dead aim on an insane assault, featuring Anti-Copter Rocket Launchers, High-Altitude Bombers and Aerial Mines. But the battle's just begun, and there's no time to kill between firefights![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 9 Lives[CR]Enter the options menu and highlight "Players 3". Now press Left, then B 25 times.

				<title_clean>Gyromite</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Gyromite is a video game for the NES released in 1985 and one of two games designed to make use of the Robotic Operating Buddy (R.O.B.) accessory (the other being Stack-Up). to help a professor clear a lab of dangerous dynamite. Though the game is officially known as Gyromite, the game's title screen displays the title as Robot Gyro.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is meant to be played as a single-player game with the player controlling the professor's movement using the D-pad on the first controller and R.O.B. raising and lowering barriers by pressing the A and B Buttons on the second controller. By pressing start, the player can program R.O.B. to perform this task by interacting with a series of "gyros", or tops. The game communicates with R.O.B. by emitting screen flashes in patterns that the robot can scan and understand.[CR]To press a button, R.O.B. must first collect a gyro that a separate device uses a motor to spin. He then must place the gyro on a button platform that holds the controller, which then presses the appropriate button to raise or lower red and blue pillars that block the player's path. In practice, however, R.O.B.'s movement and method of interaction with the game are very slow and tend to drag the pace of the gameplay. R.O.B.'s interaction is also not precise, as the gyros can stop spinning and fall off the buttons, resetting the pillars. Due to this dependency, it is more convenient and accurate for a second player to take R.O.B.'s place.[CR]</plot>

As they move along stages, they can temporarily incapacitate overeager fans, paparazzi, rival musicians, yakuza and any other troublemakers in their way by singing at them.[CR]Both characters move simultaneously, but do not occupy the same space: This means if the player jumps a pit and the second character following behind falls in, that character loses a life. Each of the two characters has a separate lives counter and the game is over if just one of them should lose all their lives.[CR]The game was developed and published by Victor Musical Industries, prior to the company's name change to Victor Interactive. The company also produced a lot of musical acts (true to its name) which is why the game is musician themed.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In Hatris, the falling blocks of Tetris are replaced by falling hats which are  top hats, cowboy hats, baseball caps, derbys, party hats and crowns. The setting is a hat factory, where hats are dropped down from a conveyor belt two at a time and must be stacked on one of six mannequin heads. Once five hats of the same kind have been stacked on top of each other, they fall down onto another conveyor belt below and are shipped out of the factory, rewarding the player with a cash bonus. (The game keeps track of score as money, not simply points.)  Once you ship out enough hats out of the shop, you go up a level to the next shop. The higher shop number you get to, the more types of hats start appearing to make it more difficult for you to accomplish your task. The game ends when one of your stacks of hats reaches the top of the screen.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Play in Turbo-Speed Mode[CR]Enter the code at the title screen then select your shop and stage. If you entered the code correctly the word TURBO will appear above Vladimir's head in the bottom right corner.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Heisei Tensai Bakabon ("Heisei-period Genius Bakabon") is a platformer and the second game based on the Tensai Bakabon manga about an idiot boy and his lazy and even dumber father; a sort of proto-Simpsons slice of life comedy manga. The player assumes the role of the father, usually referred to only as Bakabon's Papa, as he makes his way through various capers through 2D side-scrolling platformer stages. [CR]The game is based on the post-1989 incarnation of the anime series, hence "Heisei", but is still otherwise the same series. The first game based on this license is the 1988 (thus, pre-Heisei) Tensai Bakabon for the Sega Master System. Heisei Tensai Bakabon also saw an identically-titled port/sequel for the Game Boy in 1992.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Passwords[CR]Input the password at the start of the game to continue at the desired area.

				<title_clean>Hello Kitty World</title_clean>
				<plot>The little kitten Kitty, her kitten friend Mimi and their bear friend Tippy love playing with balloons. One day, Tippy has inflated a whole bunch of balloons when suddenly a strong wind blows. Tippy is blown away! The only way for Kitty and Mimi to find their friend again is to pick some balloons and fly to her rescue.[CR]Hello Kitty World is quite similar to Balloon Kid  a forced side-scrolling platform adventure where you control a character floating around with a balloon in the hand. Kitty (or Mimi) starts out on each level with two balloons, and by pushing the A button, she moves upward before sinking again if the button is not pushed again. When Kitty comes in contact with an enemy, she will just rebound, but she will fall to the ground if both balloons are hit. By pushing the B button, Kitty can also choose to let go in order to walk around like a normal platform character. This is necessary in order to reach power-ups and hidden areas. Since the scrolling is forced, it is easy to go get stuck and pushed off the screen.[CR]Throughout the levels, Tippy has dropped balloons that can be picked up for points. If twenty balloons are picked up in succession, they turn into double balloons worth more points. Enemies come both in the airbourne and ground-based varieties, along with some fish that can surprisingly jump out of the water. Some enemies can only fly by holding balloons, and just like in Balloon Fight, these can be disposed of by touching their balloons.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]Beat the game, now at the screen with the four Japanese characters, press A + B + Select + Start on the first controller. If done right, you can select the music track with Up or Down, then play it by pressing A.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]One of the earliest JRPGs, following the success of Dragon Quest I &amp; II, Heracles no Eikou: Toujin Makyou Den (lit: "Glory of Heracles: Labors of the Divine Hero") has the player control the Ancient Greek demigod of Heracles (or Hercules, as he's known in Roman myth) as he assists the Goddess of Love Aphrodite while completing his legendary twelve Herculean tasks.[CR]The game is modelled on Dragon Quest and plays similarly to that and other 8-bit JRPGs: Heracles can walk around town interacting with hint-providing NPCs, purchase equipment and items at stores and save the game. Battles are turn-based and continue until one side has lost all their HP.[CR]Heracles no Eikou has a few minor improvements to the Dragon Quest formula, such as giving shopkeepers portraits or changing Heracles' sprite to reflect armor changes.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>As a child, a young boy named Gaou lost an arm and an eye, and as a result, from a young age he was discriminated against and teased, unable to fit in with his peers. The constant ridicule and persecution caused Gaou to become bitter, and hardened, eventually turning to a life as a thief. In spite of his wicked and corrupt lifestyle, Gaou met a woman who saw goodness in him, and the two were married. However, one day, over nothing more than a trifling disagreement, Gaou lost control of himself, and killed his wife. Realization of what he had done caused Gaou to deeply regret his wicked deeds, and reform his behavior. Gaou encountered a Buddhist monk who helped him change his ways, and discover his passion for sculpting. Renouncing his previous life of violence, Gaou became a Buddhist sculptor, devoting himself to the creation of magnificent sculptures renowned for the raw and powerful emotions he was able to invoke in his work. One day, together with a fellow sculptor Akanemaru, Gaou encountered a mythical phoenix, who, according to legend, can bestow eternal life to those who drink its blood. Inspired, Gaou devotes himself to the creation of a magnificent phoenix sculpture. However, shortly after finishing the sculpture, it was stolen from him, broken into 16 pieces, and hidden in different time periods of the past and the future. In order to recover the 16 phoenix sculpture pieces, Gaou embarked on a perilous journey that would take him through space and time.[1]</plot>

				<plot>David Bowie once sang "you've gotta have a scheme/you've gotta have plan/for the world of today/for tomorrow's man". But David Bowie has said a lot of strange things, so let's not mix him up in this review.[CR]Hirake Ponkikki features a variety of annoying games, which if thought out well could have turned out fun like Mario Party. Instead, it's just a variety of annoying games for the lowest common denominator rehashed again and again, and it smacks of developers stuck with a licence and no good idea to go with it. When you start the game, you find yourself on a map with a set of levels. The first level is an annoying forced-scrolling platformer, in which you pick up easily-accessible fruits and dodge animals that walk threateningly at you at a medium pace. It's a good game to play if you've suffered a terrible hand accident and want something unchallenging to play while you recover.[CR]The next game, your guy's little friend hides in one of many cups and shifts the cups around. You have to guess which cup your guy's little friend is in. The only case in which someone could lose at this game is if they have the attention span of a doughnut, or if they were too busy writing a snotty review to watch the cups.[CR]After that is a familiar rock-paper-scissors game, which is probably fun for avid fans of rock-paper-scissors whose friends are all sick of being bugged to play it. Gape in awe as the game scores your ability to sit through a game of chance. Amazingly, you don't actually have to press any buttons for this one. Presumably this is a measure for players who aren't quite confident in their ability to play videogames. I got a better score sitting in front of the screen drinking Coke than I did trying to play the game.[CR]Everybody wins at Hirake Ponkikki.[CR]I started Hirake Ponkikki in the knowledge it was a kid's game, but when I played the next mini-game, I lost all hope for the slightest pang of entertainment or challenge. If kids old enough to be playing NES are in any way challenged by a game where you have to match up shapes, then it's a miracle they managed to figure out how to hold the control pad and press buttons.[CR]I have no desire to describe the following game, because it's even stupider than the last game and I'm running low on bile and vitriol.[CR]Once you clear the gauntlet of stupid, you can stop by a rather underwhelmed-looking mountain and enjoy a picnic cutscene, which really makes all the time you've wasted on the game worth it.[CR]Then you can cross the bridge, and there's a fresh gauntlet of rehashed stupid waiting for you on the other side. If by this point you feel bored and don't really want to put in the effort  that's okay. You can clear stages with 0 points, and your little guy will still be so pleased that he "won".[CR]Translation Description:[CR]Oh boy, a complete translation. The translation does feel a bit odd in places, be it intentional mispellings for space (Moutain?) or the use of the word "Notice" instead of "Score" or something on the score screen, but chances are by that point in the game you'll be too busy rolling on the floor clutching your head and weeping to notice.[CR]Reviewer: satsu[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/904/[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] World Passwords[CR]Input the passwords after selecting 1 or 2 player mode.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Flying Dragon: Secret of the Scroll is actually the second Hiry&#363; no Ken (the name of the series in Japan) title, the first being Shanghai Kid (or Hokuha Syourin Hiryu no Ken in Japan). Like that game, there is an in-depth (for the time) fighting system that includes combos and hitting the opponent's weak spot when indicated for significant damage. Likewise, the player must be sure to block their own weak points once highlighted to prevent the same happening to them.[CR]The game is noted for its abundance of exposition cutscenes, told through talking heads. These explain the fighting system in great detail as well as provide further elaboration on the story: That important teaching scrolls were stolen from Ryuhi's master Juan and need to be recovered, before the ultimate move - the titular Hiryuu no Ken (lit: Fist of the Flying Dragon) - can fall into the wrong hands.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As well as the duels with other martial artists, which play very much like those in Shanghai Kid, Flying Dragon: Secret of the Scroll also introduces scrolling brawler sequences to the series, which take place on the road between each duel contest. There are various low-level goons that try to stand in Ryuhi's way, as well as a few recurring sub-bosses such as a shuriken-wielding purple-haired girl. Reaching the end of each stage will either lead to another scrolling stage or one of the many big fights of the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Passwords[CR]Enter the passwords for the desired effect:</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Hiryu no Ken II: Dragon Tsubasa is the sequel to the original Hiryu no Ken, localized in the west as Flying Dragon: The Secret Scroll. Though Hiryu no Ken II would not see a release outside of Japan, both it and its sequel Hiryu no Ken III: 5 Rin no Ryuu Senshi would be combined together to form Flying Warriors.[CR]The game features multiple modes: The normal mode is a platformer/brawler where the player character Ryuhi must fight past legions of enemies with his martial arts while reaching the end of each stage. There's also an RPG mode which includes one-on-one fights that require some strategy behind them, using the counter/weak-point fighting system that the Hiryu no Ken series is known for. After which, the game moves onto the stages found in the above normal mode.

				<plot>For two years, your people have struggled against the relentless onslaught of invading forces. With your army reduced to a handful and your artillery depleted, further resistance seems impossible. But in a hidden underground laboratory, a team of scientists has at last perfected a new kind of fighting machinery: a bionic arm that extends and contracts, providing unheard of strength and maneuverability. Combined with an arsenal of rapid-fire, armor-piercing and heat-seeking weaponry, this will put the power of an entire army in the hands of one man... one carefully chosen soldier, who has what it takes to become a new breed of unstoppable commando... a Bionic Commando. And you are that soldier! Your mission will take you through the heavily-patrolled wilderness surrounding the enemy headquarters and into the very heart of the fortress itself. Even to the most courageous soldier, it would seem an impossible challenge. But there has never been a soldier like the Bionic Commando![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]Note that "Quick Exit" only works in horizontally-scrolling levels.</plot>

				<title_clean>Hokkaidou Rensa Satsujin - Okhotsk ni Kiyu</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A visual novel and adventure game, written and designed by Yuji Horii, it is the second game in the Yuji Horii Mysteries trilogy. Soon after the release of Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken (Portopia Serial Murder Case), he began development on Hokkaidou Rensa Satsujin: Ohotsuku ni Kiyu (Hokkaido Chain Murders: Okhotsk Vanishes) in September 1983 and released it in 1984. It was published by ASCII for the PC-6001 and PC-8801 platforms in 1984 and for the FM-7 in 1985.[CR]The game was responsible for popularizing the command selection menu system. Its replacement of the traditional verb-noun text parser interface with the command selection menu system would lead to the latter becoming a staple of adventure games and visual novels, as well as role-playing games through Horii's 1986 hit Dragon Quest. The 1987 Famicom port of Hokkaido Chain Murders also featured a point-and-click interface, much like the 1985 Famicom port of Portopia Serial Murder Case.[CR]In 1985, Hokkaidou Rensa Satsujin was followed by Karuizawa Yuukai Annai ("Karuizawa Kidnapping Guide"), the final part of the Yuji Horii Mysteries trilogy.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue[CR]After receiving the password, you'll get a screen that says "To Be Continued", to avoid having to reset the game to get out of it, just hold A + Select on controller 1 and press Up on controller 2.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] End The Card Game[CR]Whenever you are in a Blackjack match, hold B on controller 2 before dealing the cards to end the game after one match.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Holy Diver is an action platformer, similar to Konami's Castlevania, developed by Irem and was released in Japan on the Famicom in 1989. Much of the game was inspired by heavy metal music, such as borrowing the name of Ronnie Dio's single and LP Holy Diver and the protagonist being named after Randy Rhodes, of Quiet Riot.[CR]A hacker/translator named Monaco released an unofficial English translation patch for Holy Diver on April 28, 2007.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game&#8217;s protagonist, Randy, is a hero who must persevere through six stages of various settings, including cliffs, a castle, lava cave, ice cave and what could be the inside of a living creature, as in the Contra games. His task at hand is to seek out the five emblem seals of the King Crimson family in order to destroy the evil Black Slayer.[CR]Randy has the ability to shoot holy fire blasts from his hands, and through defeating bosses, is given such magical fire powers as Blizzard and Thunder spells. Later on in the game, he also obtains the ability to transform into a dragon, which turns the game temporarily into a shmup.[CR]Holy Diver features a wide array of unique enemies, ranging from demons to dragons to golems. The level bosses are huge and require using all of Randy&#8217;s magical powers and abilities. Each boss drops a power-up; Blizzard Magic, Breaker Magic, Overdrive Magic, Thunder Magic and the Cape of Protection.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra Lives[CR]Start a new game, and in the beginning jump right to the top of the tree. Press Start on the first controller to pause the game, hold A + B on the second controller, then press Start on the first controller again. The lives counter will be increased each time you do this. It is only works on the specified height coordinates, there is a lot of places with such coordinates other than this, although this is the earliest known rendition of it.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Honshogi: Naitou Kudan Shogi Hiden (Roughly translated: "Book of Japanese Chess: Naito Kudan's Japanese Chess Secret") is a video game biased off of the board game Shoji (Japanese Chess). It was developed and published by SETA Corporation to be released August 10, 1985, exclusively in Japan for the Nintendo Entertainment System.[CR]Naito Kudan[CR]The game is named for Naito Kunio Kudan, a famous Shoji player from Japan. Born November 15, 1939, Naito has been a professional Shoji player since he was 18 years old. In addition to helping with this video game, Naito Kudan is a published author, having 13 books written about Shoji and running a column in the sports section of the newspaper. He is also a published singer but mostly does it as a hobby. In 2010 Naito was honored with the Order of the Rising Sun, twin Mitsuaki, the fifth highest honor a citizen can receive in Japan.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Honshogi: Naitou Kudan Shogi Hiden, follows the standard rules of Shoji (Japanese Chess). There is no ability to change the difficulty or handicap. Most of the screen is the Shoji board, but there is also a representation of the player and computer playing Shoji in a Japanese setting, which moves as the game moves. The player always starts first, with the fastest possible way to beat the computer set at 15 hands/turns.Operation of the cursor/hand with the D-PadSelect and release with the A-buttonCancel with the B-button[CR]Honshogi: Naitou Kudan Shogi Hiden was entered into the first annual World Computer Shoji Championship in 1990. It was the only NES entrant out of the six entrant, software versus software competition. The game finished in forth place, with a record of two wins and three losses.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In this video game adaption of the Steven Spielberg film Hook, the player takes the role of a grown-up Peter Pan, whose kids have been kidnapped by Captain Hook. Tinker Bell takes Peter back to Neverland where he must again become Pan and reclaim his children.[CR]This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling action game, in which players must hack their way past Hook's denizens through 11 levels.  These include forests, icy regions, and towns which Peter will have to jump, climb, and swim through. Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be collected for special powers. When enemies are attacked, they simply put their hands up in surrender rather than dying, so as to make the game more child-friendly.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] All Levels Open &amp; Credits[CR]At the title screen, press Right, Up, Up, Down, Down, Right, Left and Up. If done right, a sound should be heard. Now you can press Select to view the game's ending or you can start the game and press B on the map to go to any level you select.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Hototogisu, which is a common cuckoo in Japan and appears in a lot of its culture, is a war simulation game based in the Warring States era, also known as the Sengoku period. It is also the same historical period in which many other Japanese war simulation games, such as Koei's Nobunaga's Ambition, are set. As with those games, the goal is to balance one's duties as a daimyo - feudal lord - with expanding and increasing one's territories through warfare and diplomacy.[CR]Hototogisu would be followed up many years later in 2008 with Sengoku Efuda Yuugi: Hototogisu Ran for the PSP. It uses the basic structure of its NES forebear but also introduces a collectible card game element to the strategy as well.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Disable Background Music[CR]Press and hold A + B on controller 1, then press Reset. This will turn off the background music during the game.</plot>

The player can discover all manner of items and enemies by digging through each level.[CR]The goal is to find four keys, usually hidden inside containers or dirt, which will reveal the exit to the level a la the original Bomberman. The player can also find a shovel power-up that boosts their speed, items which increase their score, eggs which either contain enemies or items and bombs which destroy certain blocks that Hottaman cannot drill through (as well as any enemies caught in its blast).[CR]Though clearly inspired by Dig Dug, right down to the player character's robotic-looking white hazard suit, the game also aims to expand beyond the classic's smaller scope, adding a lot of extras and making each level suitably enormous. The game was Use Corporation's first foray into development for the NES.

				<plot>Eddie Hawkins, a.k.a. The Hudson Hawk, is called the world's greatest cat burglar, but he's called it quits. Some others, though, aren't ready for the Hawk to retire. They blackmail him into stealing priceless works by Leonardo da Vinci from a heavily guarded auction house and from the Vatican itself! The job has Hawk dodging bullets and guard dogs, thwarting sophisticated security systems, dangling from rooftops and crawling through booby-trapped ventilation shafts. And if Hawk makes it out alive? Well maybe he can turn the tables on his blackmailers. Because they aren't just art collectors, they have a plot to rule the world! But if Hawk can break into their lair, he just might be able to steal the one object that can stop them. The Hudson Hawk? Saving the world? It's a dirty job, but hey, somebody's got to do it![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Infinite Lives[CR]At the title screen, press Up, Up, Left, Left, Right, Left, Down, Select, Select.

				<title_clean>Hydlide Special</title_clean>
				<plot>When Hydlide was released for the Famicom, it was actually given the name Hydlide Special to denote certain enhancements that this version contained over the original. Magic was only introduced to the series in Hydlide 2, but was retrofitted for use in the Famicom version of the original Hydlide. As a result, it plays only a minor role in the game. Hydlide is rather small, and can easily be beaten in only a couple of hours if one knows exactly where to go.[CR]However, players of more modern RPGs will find the experience less than enjoyable for a few reasons. The game's very short tune plays repeatedly without change to many players' annoyance. The combat system takes some getting used-to, and the player's defense rarely ever improves. And last, but not least, the task of leveling up can be quite repetitive, and requires a lot of patience. While Hydlide was celebrated as an evolution in the Role Playing Genre in Japan, it was simply seen as a poor imitator in America.

It is known as Hyper Olympic in Japan.It has been ported to over nine different platforms including the NES, as well as Xbox Live Arcade, since its original release.Track &amp; Field introduced a button-mashing style of gameplay in which the player must press a button as fast as possible, and their in-game character interacts with the environment accordingly. This style of gameplay is still used today by many popular titles. The arcade release accommodated up to four players at once. The NES version (arguably the most popular) was designed for only two players.

				<title_clean>Ice Climber</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ice Climber is an early NES title that can be played with 1 or 2 players, and 2 players can be competitive or somewhat cooperative. Players are Eskimos wielding mallets who try to ascend the mountain to the top, getting past obstacles on the way. At the top there will be a bonus stage which, if failed, will simply lose the chance to earn points rather than dying as is the case with the rest of the mountain. Players accumulate points through the 32 different mountains as the difficulty increases.[CR]Mechanics of an Ascent[CR]The two Eskimos, Popo and Nana, each have a mallet, which works automatically when they jump, clearing out ice platforms and birds overhead, and they can also swing it to stun yetis, destroy ice that yetis are pushing, and knock birds into the water. The main purpose of the mallet is to break through the ice that will be overhead. The ice that isn't broken away will then be a platform for the next level in the ascent. Some of the ice is unbreakable, while some is all but frictionless, making it very hard to maneuver.[CR]At each level in the climb there may be a yeti (or seal in the Japanese versions) which will scroll from the left or right side of the screen. Taking a mallet to the yeti will stun it, sending it away and dropping down if it happens to be near a hole in the floor. Touching the yeti is lethal, and yetis also push ice out from their caves to cover gaps that the players have left in the ice.[CR]Birds will also begin flying down, and are also lethal if touched, but can also be taken out with the mallet. Some places have very little platforms to stand on, and tend to have indestructible floating clouds that scroll past. In later levels these scroll by faster and faster as well as becoming smaller and smaller.[CR]Death comes should the player fall too far down (into an area near the bottom of the screen should there be no platform to catch Popo's fall). This can be used to the advantage of the other player in a competitive game, and respawning will sometimes happen in very precarious positions, increasing the chance for a chain of deaths.[CR]When the player reaches about halfway up, they will reach a bonus area where several slightly anthropomorphic vegetables are laid out. Players race to collect these before the time expires (in a bonus round vaguely similar to Nintendo's Mario Bros.). At the end, the players make a jump for a condor resembling a pterodactyl that scrolls across the top of the screen. Hitting the bottom of the screen, running out of time, or reaching the condor ends the bonus stage, and then points are awarded for vegetables collected, birds and yetis malleted, yeti ice crushed, and floor segments destroyed. The scores are tallied, and then it's time for a new mountain.[CR]There is also a polar bear wearing pink speedo and sunglasses that comes out if the player takes too long to advance a level. Should it stand at the middle of the screen, it will jump down. When it hits the bottom, scrolling the screen one level automatically, possibly forcing the player to lose a life.End-of-Round Scoring:Vegetable - Varies depending on typeYeti ice - 400Bird (Nitpicker) - 800Ice Blocks - 20Reaching the Condor first - 1000 X seconds remaining (?)[CR]Other Appearances[CR]The Ice Climbers make an appearance in the Super Smash Bros. series as playable characters. They work in tandem, acting as one character.[CR]The Nitpicker bird shares the name with the birds that plague Donkey Kong Jr. in his eponymous game.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Idol Hakkenden</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Idol Hakkenden is a Famicom adventure game, based on the same menu system found in other examples in the genre like Portopia Renzoku Satsujin Jiken. The player, as the bubbly idol-in-training Erika, learns of a plot that could halt her music career before it's even started. She must stop it, and also learn the lyrics to various J-Pop songs she needs to become the nation's favorite idol.[CR]The game's title and its plot loosely relates to the famous Japanese 19th century epic novel Nansou Satomi Hakkenden (or Eight Dog Chronicles) about eight samurai half-brothers. The game features eight heroines including Erika, all of which are met during the game's story and have varied personalities.[CR]The game is notable for being one of the earliest projects from Natsume, best known for their Harvest Moon series and a number of well-regarded NES and SNES titles, like 1991's Shatterhand and 1994's Wild Guns. Idol Hakkenden is thought to be their second project, after 1988's Touhou Kenbun Roku.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Act Passwords[CR]Use the CONTINUE option at the main screen to skip to the specific act.</plot>

It was the first Famicom game developed by Bullet-Proof Software: a development studio operating out of Hawaii that would later be responsible for Nintendo's version of Tetris, among other games. This version of Go is better suited for beginners, as it contains simpler 9x9 grids rather than the regulation 19x19.[CR]Igo: Kyuu Roban Taikyoku has a credit for Edge Computing on its title screen; it is assumed some of the game's coding was taken from Edge's C64 game Micro Go.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Igo Shinan</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Igo Shinan ("Go Lessons") is a simulation of the popular board game Go from Hect. True to its name, it teaches players at both novice and expert level how to improve their Go game and provides some challenging computer opponents to play against. The player can set how much guidance the game will offer, including presenting possible moves for the player to take (generally, one is more favorable than the others) and allowing the computer to take over their turn.[CR]Hect would follow up Igo Shinan with four sequels, each referring to the year in which they were released: Igo Shinan '91, Igo Shinan '92, Igo Shinan '93, and Igo Shinan '94. Igo Shinan, and all its sequels, were only released in Japan. This was and continues to remain standard practice for most video games based on Go or Mahjong, as both board games are far less popular outside of Asia.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Indora no Hikari</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Indora no Hikari ("Light of Indora") is a fantasy RPG very much in the Dragon Quest mold. The helmed adventurer and the turn-based battles with little enemy portraits are specifically evocative of Enix's classic. Instead of a scrolling world map, however, Indora no Hikari's world is a bit more like the Legend of Zelda: Comprised of a series of tiles that the player can visit by leaving the edge of one screen and appearing on the opposite edge of the next.[CR]Similar to how many 8-bit RPGs operate, the goal of the game is to fight randomly encountered monsters (though these monsters are visible on the map as red bouncing blobs), build XP to level up, use found gold to purchase new equipment and healing items and eventually build a party of multiple characters and go fight the terrible demon that has taken the eponymous Light of Indora hostage.[CR]According to the plot of the game, the world of Indora is a far-off planet that humanity travelled to once the Earth's resources had run out. If so, this doesn't quite explain the apparent pre-industrial technology level of this world, nor its reliance on magic and Gods.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Jajamaru Ninpou Chou</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Jajamaru Ninpou Chou is part of Jaleco's Ninja Jajamaru-Kun series. Jajamaru-Kun (sometimes spelled JaJaMaru-Kun) is the younger brother of the original Ninja-Kun, who starred in a couple of UPL arcade games known in the west as Ninja-Kid and Ninja-Kid 2. When Jaleco ported the original arcade game to NES, they created the character of Ninja Jajamaru-Kun and continued making games that featured the character. Jajamaru Ninpou Chou is his third Famicom game.[CR]However, unlike the two previous Ninja Jajamaru-Kun games, which were action platformers, Ninpou Chou is a traditional JRPG. The player walks around a world map visiting towns and dungeons and occasionally fighting random encounters using a separate turn-based combat screen.[CR]Worth noting is that this game was slated for a 1990 US release with the name Taro's Quest, though it was later canceled. However, an incomplete prototype version of the ROM exists. As well as an English localization, the game appeared to have had its graphics almost entirely redrawn in order to appear more realistic than the cartoonish original.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Have Princess Hanna in Your Party (Second Scenario; US Version)[CR]When playing the U.S. version of this game and starting the second scenario, unlike the Japanese version, you'll find that you do not have Princess Hanna in your party. You can remedy this fact and greatly bolster your party's power by holding B on Controller 2 during the briefing for the second scenario. You'll now have Princess Hanna in your party.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Unlock harder difficulties and weapons.[CR]After beating the game with certain criteria, new modes and weapons shall be unlocked.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound Test (US Version)[CR]This can be done during the second quest of the game, the first one in which you can have the Princess Sakura as an ally. In the overworld, to the east of the Town of Inns (the first town), and south near the shoreline, there is a shop selling Eggplants for $50. Normally, you are supposed to go back to the Town of Inns and speak with the monster in the center of the town to turn it back into a human. However, if you buy an Eggplant, then use it through the item menu, you will access a sound test mode. Use the D-Pad to shift through the music, the A Button to play the music, and the B Button to exit the mode.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra Chapter[CR]If you clear the chapters in order (Chapter 1 --&amp;gt; 2 --&amp;gt; 3), you'll unlock a hidden final chapter.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easily Defeat Magic-Blocking Bosses[CR]Many of the bosses in this game have a tendency to block any attacks you use through spells. This makes battles much more difficult because magic does fixed damage and can make quick work of even the most difficult of bosses. However, there is a way to circumvent this due to a programming oversight regarding the "Living SWD" item. Living SWD's are random item drops from Dragonflies in the final dungeon of the second quest; they deal a fixed 60 damage to the target. This even affects bosses, meaning that - if you have at least six Living SWD's - you can kill a boss in three turns or less![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Have Princess Sakura in Later Quests[CR]At the beginning of the game, you are given the choice of three quests in which to participate. Under normal circumstances, you are intended to proceed from the first, to the second, to the third, then onto the hidden fourth quest on Zakuro Island -- even so, it is possible to do them out of order if you wish. However, if you don't them in order, you will not have the aid of your second ally, Princess Sakura: she only becomes part of your party as a result of completing the first quest, thusly making it much to your benefit to do the quests in the order the game intends.</plot>

Instead of the shorter levels of its antecedents, Jajamaru no Daibouken takes a cue from Super Mario Bros. and has long, side-scrolling stages through various environments, defeating enemies and collecting power-ups along the way. At the end of every level, the player has a chance to score bonus points by defeating a boss character, and at the end of every tenth level defeats his nemesis and rescues the princess. The game continues with even more challenging stages each time Jajamaru's nemesis is defeated.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]JESUS: Kyoufu no Bio Monster is a Famicom port of Enix's classic 1987 visual novel adventure game, JESUS. The Famicom port was created by Chunsoft and King's Record in 1989. The game is a cult classic amongst many Japanese and American retro gamers thanks to the game's eye catching title. Though the Famicom port had a lower resolution than the NEC PC-88 original, this is the version of the game best known to Western gamers.[CR]Fan Translation[CR]English title screen designed by sin_batsu[CR]JESUS: Kyoufu no Bio Monster was never released outside of Japan but an English translation patch was released by Niahak in 2006. However due to space limitations Niahak's translation had to be greatly simplified and many of the menu commands had to be abbreviated. On June 8, 2012 a new translation patch by Stardust Crusaders and Niahak was released. The new patch increased the size of the game's script and fixed many of the problems with the original translation. The patch also gave the game a new English title screen which translates the game's name as, "JESUS: Tale of the Dreadful Bio-Monster."[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Ending Password[CR]At the password screen, press Right 5 times and enter the Japanese character.

				<title_clean>Jetsons, The - Cogswell's Caper</title_clean>
				<plot>The Jetsons: Cogwell's Caper is based on the well-known Jetsons property from Hanna-Barbera. In this spin-off adventure, George Jetson is tasked my his employer to put a stop to the profit-making schemes of the rival Cogswell's company. To do this, George must hop from location to location in his jet and conquer each level using the resources available to him, as well as with the assistance of the other Jetson franchise characters.[CR]Cogswell's Caper is a side-scrolling action game where George Jetson can walk, crouch, and jump (actually, he's too lazy to jump and a jet pack handles the jumping duty for short bursts). Each level is littered with crates and other items that George can pick up and toss at enemies, while finding useful items (and occasionally even more enemies) underneath them. Since the game is set in the futuristic world of the Jetsons, there are also copious switches on walls which activate all kinds of features of the surroundings, such as a switch that reverses gravity for a brief time.</plot>

				<plot>The setting - Earth, the future. The defense computer protecting the entire planet has been invaded by a constantly mutating, evolving virus. One lone volunteer has the courage to face the virus on its own ground. Converted to raw data and transferred into the circuits of the computer, the molecular structure of this brave warrior is transformed by the as-yet untested Image Transfer System. Into the circuits of the computer steps an unlikely hero - the Quantum Fighter! Six levels of challenging action, unequalled game control, and a surprising arsenal of weapons![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Alter Chips[CR]After activating the Level Select code (press A 8 times, B 4 times, and right 16 times on the second controller on the title screen), Up and Down can be pressed on the second controller in game to increase or reduce the amount of chips the player has. Unlike the cheat to swap health for chips, this does not affect health, can be done on any stage, and the game does not have to be paused (in fact, it does NOT work while the game is paused).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]Complete the game, then after the Credits have rolled, hit the Down, B, and Select Buttons and a option for the Sound Test will appear.</plot>

				<title_clean>Jikuu Yuuden - Debias</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Part of a storm of side-scrolling action RPGs, influenced in part by the Dragon Slayer series and Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Jikuu Yuten Debias (roughly "Dimensional (or Space/Time) Legend Debias") has the player control a warrior as he completes quests for the local monarchy, fights legions of monsters and gathers hints and items from helpful NPCs. Like its many contemporaries of the time, it's a fairly straightforward fantasy RPG with some action hack-n-slash/platforming sequences.[CR]Of the game's few notable qualities, first and foremost is a "feelie" included in the box that resemble a pair of runed circles - the idea was that the player could overlay the circles and use them to decipher certain runes; a process which was necessary in order to progress in the game. The circle/rune feelie system was clearly inspired by Western RPGs like Bard's Tale (which would also later influence The Secret of Monkey Island's slightly more tongue-in-cheek "Dial-a-Pirate" anti-piracy protection device).[CR]Also of note was the game's use of the day/night cycle which, similar to Castlevania II: Simon's Quest, would clear civilized areas of wandering NPCs at night and replace them with monsters. The player can also hack apart said innocent NPCs as readily as monsters, though doing so will usually carry grave consequences.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 99 Tech[CR]First, connect an extra joystick in the Famicom's expansion port. Now, hold Up on controller 1 + Down on the extra joystick, press Select to highlight Continue and then press Start. If done right, you'll start the game with 99 Tech.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Debug Password[CR]Enter the Japanese syllables below as a password to enable debugging.</plot>

				<title_clean>Jongbou</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Jongbou is a combination of the popular Chinese board game Mahjong and a block-breaking game such as Breakout. Players bounce a ball around a Mahjong table filled with concealed tiles, with their goal being to dislodge the tiles and collect the ones they wish to add to their hand by passing underneath them as they fall. The stage is over either after all the tiles have fallen or the player has a winning hand.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Block-Breaking[CR]The block-breaking aspect is simple: Simply direct the bouncing ball by hitting it with the paddle to first destroy the wall of betting tokens before reaching the hidden tiles. Hitting a tile once reveals it, allowing the player to strategically direct the ball so that they can collect the tile (if desired) and still catch the ball before it leaves the screen.[CR]In addition, there are various power-ups that are mingled with the tiles. These have different characters than the dragons/seasons/flowers and provide different benefits, such as a partial wall to block the ball, forcefields that slow it down and special tiles that reveal all the remaining hidden tiles.[CR]It should be noted that as useful as a tile might be towards obtaining a winning hand, it is not worth losing the ball (and subsequently a life) over.Mahjong[CR]Mahjong can seem a little convoluted, but it plays essentially like the card game rummy: The goal is to collect and discard tiles until the player has a hand that is comprised of Chows (straights of three, worth nothing but easier to obtain), Pungs (three-of-a-kind) and Kongs (four-of-a-kind, worth more than Pungs). The player normally has thirteen tiles in a hand, though this becomes fourteen tiles when they're in the process of discarding one. If those fourteen tiles comprise of Chows, Pungs and Kongs (and one pair) then it is a winning hand and the holder can declare Mahjong to win the round.[CR]For the purposes of this game, much of the game's rules are unnecessary, including betting or indeed any of the multiplayer aspects. The goal is to simply put together a winning hand by collecting the right tiles as they drop. Tiles can range from "Characters" (a black symbol over a red symbol, actually Chinese numerical symbols for thousands), "Bamboo" (green sticks) and "Wheels" (black and red circles), as well as the three dragons (the red and green characters and the blank white tiles), the four seasons and four flowers. With the exception of the seasons and flowers, players need three (or four) instances of the same tile to score points.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue[CR]After getting a game over, wait for "1 Player" to appear on the title screen and press Up, Down, Left Right, Start.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released in 1982, this two-dimensional platform game played from a third-person perspective. The main character is a knight, but unlike medieval knights he rides a yellow flying ostrich. The object is to get to the next level , called a wave, without being defeated by enemy knights, who ride mounted upon flying vultures.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Jousting is hard work.[CR]The object of Joust is to defeat all of the other jousters on the stage. This can be done by making contact with them while the player's jouster's jousting spear is higher than the enemy's is. As long as this is the case when the player's jouster collides with an enemy, they will be defeated. To ensure that an enemy jouster will not return, however, it is necessary to pick up the egg that is dropped when they are defeated. If the egg isn't collected quickly, it will hatch into another jouster and another buzzard will quickly arrive to pick him up and return him to the fight.[CR]There are lava pits on either side of the island on the lowest level of the battleground. In the early stages these pits will be sealed so that falling into them is impossible, but eventually they will open up and become a hazard to both the player and the enemies. Living in the lava is a lava troll who will grab any character that flies too close to it, players and enemies, and attempt to drag them down into the lava. It is possible to escape the troll when caught by flying hard enough.[CR]An enemy pterodactyl appears if too much time elapses in a stage. The beast appears to be unbeatable, but it can actually be killed by stabbing it directly in its mouth when it is open. This is difficult however because the creature moves much faster than other enemies. It will also leave if all the other jousters on the stage are defeated.[CR]Ports[CR]Joust has appeared on nearly every popular gaming system to date in some form or another. Usually it is packaged into a "best of" package but more recently it has been sold stand-alone on popular download services such as Xbox Live Marketplace and on the PlayStation Network.[CR]Joust was ported and released on the Xbox 360 via the Xbox Live Marketplace. The game was unscaled to appear in HD and was sold for 400 Microsoft points or $5.[CR]Joust was also ported to the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network, sold for $4.99 and published by Sony Online Entertainment.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>For some reason, I had always thought TMNT Tournament Fighters was the only one-on-one fighting game for the Nes (unless you count the tournament mode of Karate Kid). BUT I THOUGHT WRONG. Not only is there another fighter for the Nes, but unlike TMNT Tournament Fighters, this one doesn't suck. Proof that Joy Mech Fighter doesn't suck? Well, for starters, after playing TMNT TF for five minutes, I thought that little gray cartridge would make an excellent substitute for a clay pidgeon. I had no such sentiments after playing Joy Mech Fighter.[CR]Anyway, I imagine you've played a fighting game before, so I'll spare you the details of what the gameplay is like, because its like every single other fighter. What sets it apart is the concept of the game. You start with one robot fighter, and as you play through the game, each robot you beat becomes a new playable character. It's like Megaman meets Street Fighter. And the graphics totally kick ass for an nes game. You've gotta check this one out, it's bound to keep you entertained for awhile.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]Umm, the translation is complete, and looks really cool! Oh, and the title screen rocks!

				<title_clean>Jumbo Ozaki no Hole in One Professional</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]HAL Laboratory, after creating many of Nintendo's golf games as a second party developer, decided to develop and publish their own golf title. Jumbo Ozaki no Hole in One Professional features the likeness of Japan's most prominent golf player, Masashi "Jumbo" Ozaki - the Jumbo nickname comes from his unusual height for a Japanese male: almost 6'. Though featured on the box art and in the title, Jumbo Ozaki makes no obvious appearance in-game.[CR]Though by all practical metrics a perfectly standard overhead golf simulator - players take it in turn to get the ball to the hole in as few shots as possible, selecting the direction, club used and power of each shot - the game does do things a little differently than usual. Specifically, the visual cue for the power of the shot comes from the depiction of the golfer himself: The player must monitor the character as he swings, hitting the button at both the apex and nadir of the swing for maximum effect. This replaces the usual sliding power bar that most golf games have. Failure to hit the swing precisely will lead to slices and hooks.[CR]The game can be played as a single player Stroke Match, which allows the player to practice on each of the game's 36 holes across two different courses. The player can also play against another human, or rate their score against CPU opponents in the 1 Day and 4 Day modes. The player can also adjust the difficulty, which makes wind speed a much more important factor.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The town of Astholm is protected by a Sapphire, one of the magical stones mentioned in old legends. Generation of honorable priestesses protect the stone, and with it the town. Tonight is the annual Sapphire Festival, and the young priestess Firis is going to conduct the ceremony. But just after the joyous event, the priestess is kidnapped by Gel du Rey, the henchman of the evil Lord Ezelkiel. You play the role of the captain of Astholm's guards. You and Firis have been close friends ever since the childhood. You decide to rescue the priestess, with the help of your loyal guards and friends you meet on your journey.[CR]Just Breed is a hybrid of traditional console-style RPG like Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy, and strategy RPG. During confrontations with the enemies, the battle screen occupies the entire location, and large parties of allies and enemies fight each other in turn-based style, moving on the field to perform physical attacks (melee as well as ranged) or to cast magic spells.</plot>

				<title_clean>Kaettekita! Gunjin Shougi - Nanya Sore!</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kaettekita! Gunjin Shogi: Nanya Sore!? is a shogi game that uses the gunjin shogi, or military shogi, variant of the classic eastern chess-like board game. The player starts by selecting one of five opponents: A pumpkin-headed ghost, a werewolf Al Capone, an alien, Adolf Hitler or a sumo wrestler. The player is then given an assortment of pieces while the opponent appears to have the same number of instances of the same piece, though in truth their real forms are concealed from the human player. The player must use their wits to defeat the enemy's force of shogi pieces, which have different themes depending on the opponent the player has chosen (for instance, when fighting the pumpkin ghost both sides have vegetable-themed pieces).[CR]When one of the player's pieces and an opponent's piece occupy the same space, a battle ensues: Some pieces will always win against other types, sort of like the rock-paper-scissors aspect of strategy games like Fire Emblem. If neither of the two pieces are weak to the other, both are eliminated. The goal is to figure out what pieces the opponent is attacking with and take them out - sometimes it is possible to ascertain what piece it is with how many spaces it can move, but the most reliable method is to see which pieces it is able to defeat, recalling its place on the rock-scissors-paper chain and then using a piece strong against it to finish it off.[CR]The game, like all shogi simulators, was never released outside of Japan.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Enemy Stats Display[CR]At the title screen, highlight "1PLAY", then hold Right, A, and B on Player 2's controller. Press A on Player 1's controller and the cheat will be executed. During a one-player game (or the demo sequence), a number will appear on the center of the screen before the enemy's turn starts, showing some of their stats. Additionally, you can hold B on Player 2's controller, then press B on Player 1's to turn the enemy names on and off.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]At the password screen, press Down 4 times and enter the Japanese character. Press Up 2 times, Left 1 time and enter the Japanese character. Press Up 2 times, Right 2 times and enter the Japanese character. Press Down 2 times and enter the Japanese character. Now select End and you'll hear a jingle confirming the correct password. Press Left or Right to scroll through the music.</plot>

				<plot>Shadow of the Ninja can be played by up to two players simultaneously, with one player controlling Hayate (the male ninja) and the other as Kaede (the female ninja). In either mode, the player can decide which character they want to control before the game actually begins. There are no actual performance differences between either character.[CR]The player character can run, crouch, climb ladders, attack, and jump like in most side-scrolling action games as well as hang onto an overhang and move under it. If the player has more than half of their vitality remaining, they can perform a special attack by holding a button for an extended period, summononing a thunderstorm that will damage all on-screen enemies, but at the cost of roughly half of their maximum vitality.[CR]The player's default weapon is a katana, which can be traded for a kusarigama and vice-versa. The kusarigama has a longer range than the katana and can be swung upwards diagonally and horizontally. However, the kusarigama can only damage enemies from a specific distance and does not work as well at close range like the katana. If the player picks up a weapon they already have, its attack power will be strengthen by an increment of one level (with up to three attack levels). However, if the player takes too much damage, their weapon's strength will be reduced back to its previous level. There is also the possibility to use both weapons, if the player starts with the kusarigama and collects secret powerups hidden in some levels (for example in the central wheel of level 1.3). The player can also obtain shurikens and hand grenades as well, both which can only be used as long the player's supply lasts before the player reverts back to using the katana or kusarigama. All four weapons are obtained by destroying item boxes scattered throughout each stage, along with vitality potions. Something worth mentioning is the fact that the potions being offered in order to heal yourself if played by 2 players will have different colors, which depending if the color of the potion is the same as the character that use it, it will replenish a large amount of health but if the color of the potion is not the same it will heal less.[CR]The game consists of five stages, with the first four stages being divided into three segments and the final stage into two. The player will fight numerous types of enemy characters throughout each stage, including bosses and sub-bosses. once a boss has been defeated it will explode, this explosion will heal players the closer they are from it, since actually the same amount of health from one stage will be carried to the next one until either recovered with potions or by dying. The game ends if the player loses all of their vitality and only five chances are provided to continue. If two players are playing the game, their continues will be shared.</plot>

				<title_clean>Kaguya Hime Densetsu</title_clean>
				<plot>The legend of Kaguya-hime is one of the most popular stories in Japanese mythology. Once upon a time, an old man went to the forest to cut some bamboo, and found a little baby girl. He took her to his house and named her Kaguya-hime. She grew up there, and soon became the most beautiful girl of Japan. Many young men, including the son of the emperor himself, tried to conquer her heart, but for no avail. One day Kaguya-hime confessed she was a moon angel, and returned back to the moon. In this game, you control the son of the emperor, and you'll do your best to reach Kaguya-hime and to protect her. You must overcome various obstacles and meet characters from Japanese folklore.[CR]The game is a traditional Japanese adventure: all the actions are performed by selecting commands from the menu, including moving from location to location. You view the locations from first-person perspective, but there are also parts where you navigate your character from a  top-down view. Beside the usual adventure commands such as "look", "take", or "use" (an inventory item) there are some more original actions available under "extras", such as "kiss", "attack", and even "undress".</plot>

				<title_clean>Kaijuu Monogatari</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kaijuu Monogatari ("Shell Creature Story") is an 8-bit RPG for the NES that more than superficially resembles Enix's Dragon Quest. As with many RPG contemporaries for the system, it borrows the basic premise (talk to the King, discover what to do next, fight some evil force) and the turn-based tactical combat and gradual character development of its major influence, but also much of its aesthetic: The box art has some Akira Toriyama-inspired artwork and the protagonist wears a familiar suit of blue armor. Kaijuu Monogatari's subtitle - Shell Saurs Story - is a localization of its Japanese name.[CR]The plot, in greater detail, concerns a race of peaceful shell creatures that have four elemental warriors that united to fight the villainous Fat Badger but were separated in the final struggle. The player needs to unite the four by exploring the world and discovering the locations of the other three warriors, then regrouping for another attack.[CR]A unique twist, though one that would also become a feature in Dragon Quest IV (thus coming full circle innovation-wise), is that the player is able to assume any of one these four heroes at any point by selecting a menu option, though each one begins at level 1 and is very weak. In order for the party to be strong enough to meet up, each must be independently raised to a sufficiently high level.[CR]The game would eventually spawn its own franchise with sequels and spin-offs being released for the Super Famicom and Game Boy in Japan.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kid Kool is a side-scrolling platformer for the NES, developed and published by Vic Tokai. It was originally released in 1988, and is based on high-speed running and difficult jumps.[CR]Kid Kool was originally named Kakefu Kimi no Jump Tengoku: Speed Jigoku in Japan ("Kakefu's Jump Heaven: Speed Hell") and featured a then-popular child actor named Kenji Sagara. Since the license wouldn't mean anything to westerners, the localized version's name (and the game's hero) was changed.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Kid Kool takes place in an unnamed fantasy kingdom where the King has fallen deathly ill. His only hope to get well again lies with the Seven Wonder Herbs. The King dispatches the young Kid Kool on a quest to retrieve the herbs. He must travel across the kingdom and return with the herbs in less than three days, or the king may be lost...[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Kid Kool is played on a standard NES pad, where left and right are used to run, pressing A jumps, and B throws Kid Kool's animal companion and blunt weapon "Wicky." Wicky is a small, red, fluffy creature similar to a Tribble which can be thrown to knock out enemies, and later retrieved. Enemies can also be defeated by stomping from above.[CR]The physics in Kid Kool, although primitive, impose a sense of momentum when running and jumping. The titular character accelerates from a slow jog to a dash, and is unable to change the direction of his jump in mid-air. Some set-pieces in the levels make further use of the game physics; flagpoles, for example, bend proportionately to how fast Kid Kool is moving when he hits them, and they can fling Kid Kool either very high in the air or over a great lateral distance. This sort of gameplay makes Kid Kool similar to other early physics-based platforming games like Super Mario Bros or Sonic The Hedgehog.[CR]The pretense of the King's illness also places a time limit on the game. Kid Kool's mission to find the Seven Wonder Herbs in three days translates to three hours' worth of in-game time. The player will get a different ending based on whether or not they were able to finish the game within that time.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Unlock multiple endings[CR]There are 5 possible endings in this game, depending on how much time you spent in the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 255 Extra Lives[CR]Whenever you see a tall springy pole (that you can vault yourself off of) vault off of it and land on the top of the pole. If done correctly, you'll bounce 10 times on the pole, and gain 1 extra life for each bounce. After that, die and repeat the process. [CR][B]Note:[/B] The maximum amount you can get is 255 lives. If you go over 255, you will be taken back to 1 Life.</plot>

				<plot>Kamen Rider Club: Gekitotsu Shocker Land is an action adventure game developed for the Famicom and published by Bandai in Japan on February 3, 1988. It is based on Bandai's Kamen Rider franchise, a weekly science fiction story created by Japanese manga artist Shotaro Ishinomori which was published in Sh&#333;nen Magazine, as well as being aired on television.[CR]The story takes place in a world plagued by Shocker, a mysterious terrorist organization. To further its plans for world domination, Shocker recruited its agents through kidnapping, turning their victims into mutant cyborgs and, ultimately, brainwashing them. However, one victim named Takeshi Hongo escaped just before the final brainwashing. With his sanity and moral conscience intact, Hongo battled Shocker's minions as the grasshopper-themed altered human superhero Kamen Rider. Another of Shocker's victims, freelance photographer Hayato Ichimonji, had also been given cyborg implants, but was saved by Kamen Rider from the brainwashing process to become Kamen Rider #2. Assisted by motorcycle race team manager Tobei Tachibana and FBI agent Kazuya Taki, the Kamen Riders fought in both solo and partnered missions against both Shocker and its successor organization Gel-Shocker.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kamen no Ninja Akakage ("Masked Ninja Red Shadow") is a ninja side-scrolling slice-'em-up that is based on an anime of the same name that was released in the same time period, which in turn is based on a much older live-action tokusatsu (superhero) TV show about a masked vigilante ninja that helps people (similar to, say, Zorro or the Masked Ranger. Or Kamen Rider for that matter).[CR]It was developed by Shouei System (occasionally known as Bear's) for Toei Animation, the publishers of the game and owners of the license. This duo of developer/publisher was also responsible for the NES Hokuto no Ken (Fist of the North Star) games, among other anime licenses.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released on July 30, 1987 in Japan, Karaoke Studio looked to cash in on the ever popular pastime of karaoke as well as the new Famicom system. The game never saw a release outside of Japan. The game featured 8-bit versions of Japanese pop songs. The game consisted of a microphone and a subsystem that fit into the Famicom's cartridge slot. 25 songs came on the initial subsystem and 2 additional expansion tapes were released to play more songs.[CR]Expansion Tapes[CR]The first expansion was Senyou Cassette Hit Top 20 Vol. 1, released on October 28th, 1987. It contains additional tracks based on then-popular music and needs to be inserted into the Karaoke Studio subsystem in order to access them.[CR]The second expansion - Senyou Cassette Hit Top 20 Vol. 2 - came a little later, on February 18th of the following year. Like the first expansion, it featured additional songs that were popular in Japan at the time and could be plugged into the existing Karaoke Studio. Both expansions required the original to play.[CR]External Links[CR]http://famicomworld.com/system/other/karaoke-studio/[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Microphone Test[CR]On Player 2's controller, hold A and B.

				<title_clean>Karateka</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Karateka was the first commercial project of Prince of Persia creator Jordan Mechner, released in 1984 on the Apple II. Karateka's animation was years ahead of its time. When it was released, it had the most realistic animations ever made for a video game.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The player, a master of the martial art Karate (known as a "Karateka"), must save the beautiful Princess Mariko, who is being held prisoner in the castle of the evil warlord Akuma.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The combat consists of side views of the player and the enemy, like a fighting game. The player progresses through a courtyard and castle structure until reaching the final room where the end game boss resides. There are several screens worth of empty hallways after each encounter. The player runs through these screens to the right, and occasionally, the screen will change and the view will shift towards the enemy's perspective as he runs (to the left), towards the player. As the two converge towards battle, the time between screen changes rapidly increases, adding an early bit of cinematic flair to the game.The player can issue a series of punches and kicks, as can the enemy. Both can also adjust the height of the punches and kicks using the joystick. The types of punches and kicks can also be specified. The player only has one life but unlike many other games of its time, the player has health points. Once the health points are deleted, the player dies. Depending on the game version, these health points can be recovered by resting, in other words by not attacking or being hit. The original Apple II version had no way to recover health or block attacks, so the player had to be very careful positioning for an attack and rationing his health against the enemy guards.Although some games had started to feature it, Karateka had no save function. However, the game was so short that it really didn't make a difference.The player had two stances, which could be swapped by pressing up or down on the joystick. The non-combat stance allowed the player to sprint and traverse the environment quickly. However, an enemy could score an instant, one-hit kill on any player who wasn't in the combat stance. Sprinting carried momentum, similar to the original Prince of Persia, so these one-hit kills happened often as the enemy could always enter their combat stance faster than the player.There is a minor easter egg that's only apparent at the beginning of the game. If the player carefully approaches the very first guard in the non-fighting stance, he can push down to bow to the guard, who will in turn bow back. The player can repeat this process as long as he wants - each subsequent bow will be mirrored by the guard. The guard will only fight the player if he gets too close or a combat stance is initiated. As all the other enemies are already in a combat stance by the time they reach the player, bowing was only feasible to do with the very first guard.[CR]Ports[CR]The game was later ported to the Amstrad CPC, Atari 800, Commodore 64, DOS, and ZX Spectrum in 1986. Karateka was also ported to the Atart 7800 in 1987, but featured broken controls and poor animation, making it one of the worst games on the console. The game was also ported to the Famicom and Game Boy in Japan. The Game Boy version was released under the name "Masters of Karateka", despite there being only one such Karate master in the game.[CR]Popular Culture[CR]There are several parts of the game that have become increasingly famous thanks to the Internet:The very first area of the game has the Karateka standing with the path to Akuma's fortress to his right and a cliff to his left, behind him. If the player chooses to back up instead of walking forward, the Karateka will indeed walk right off the cliff and fall to his death.Arguably the most memorable "fight" of the game is the surprise attack by Akuma's trained eagle, who is fought before Akuma himself. Its attack may catch the player off-guard, killing him in one hit.If the player remains in the fighting stance while approaching Princess Mariko, the princess will kick the player in the head, killing him instantly. This causes the player to start the game over from the beginning.If the floppy disk is inserted into the computer on the wrong side, the game will play upside down. Mechner has stated that he put this in deliberately, as a joke.The ending sequence to Karateka was famously rotoscoped and changed to the Karateka dancing to MC Hammer's "U Can't Touch This" in an Internet video. "Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger" by Daft Punk was later added to the same footage to create "Ninja Works It".[CR]The Future of Karateka[CR]During a talk at Comic-Con 2008, Jordan Mechner announced his involvement in the production of a new Karateka video game. No details were given on the new title, except that Mechner would be directly involved (unlike the more recent Prince of Persia titles). Mechner teased that the new game is "not going to be in the way you expect" ( source). Despite this early and definitive confirmation, the remake was not officially announced until February 2012, when Mechner stated that the new Karateka would be available on downloadable services by the end of the year.[CR]</plot>

The game features 9 levels in which Karnov must fight his way through various enemies and collect treasures. The final boss of the game is often known as "The Wizard".

The game features a wide variety of very strange enemies, including but not limited to skeletons riding ostriches, golden statues which break apart and reform, and what appear to be professional wrestlers.

				<title_clean>Keiba Simulation - Honmei</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Keiba Simulation: Honmei ("keiba" is the Japanese word for horse-racing, and "honmei" is a term meaning a favorite to win) is a Famicom horse-racing simulation game from Nichibutsu, often known as Nihon Bussan. In fact, the box art states the former as developer and the title screen states the latter.[CR]As a true simulation game, there is no racing (at least that the player can control) or gambling. The player instead can fiddle with the parameters for each race and the horses competing, changing their stats such as fatigue, age and the weight of the jockey. Then players can watch a race with these settings play out and observe the winner. It is possible the goal of this game is to recreate the likely output of an actual race based on as much information as the player is able to muster in order to assist them with their gambling, though its more likely the game is for racing enthusiasts.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]True romance.[CR]Released along side another Konami game called King Kong 2 (although in this case, King Kong 2: Yomigaeru Densetsu/ "The Resurrected Legend" and coincidentally a totally different game) this game was released to capitalize off the release of the new King Kong movie. Konami never developed a "King Kong 1"; the game is called King Kong 2 simply because of the film; the movie was marketed in Japan under the title"King Kong 2" rather than King Kong Lives.[CR]The game's scenario features Kong escaping a laboratory; unfortunately Kong's girlfriend, Lady Kong, is still held prisoner by the enemies elsewhere. Kong must journey through a variety of disparate and strange worlds and defeat many strange enemies to collect the keys needed to rescue her.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game features a top-down view of play; Kong can move in eight directions, and is capable of jumping and punching. In addition, Kong has can throw rocks; he can switch between rock throwing and punching mode via the select button. The number of rocks that can be thrown is limited, but rocks are a common item throughout the game and Kong can also find items that permanently increase the stock of his rocks, barring death. The player must navigate Kong through various strange maze-like environments, battling enemies ranging from tanks to giant enraged ducks in order to find the hidden lairs of the bosses who are holding keys to the final area where Lady Kong is help captive.ItemsA bottle of speed.[CR]There are a number of items to be found in the game; they will help make Kong's journey a little easier.Heart: Dropped by enemies, these recover Kong's life points by 5.Rock: Also dropped by enemies, these replenish Kong's rock stock by 5.Hyper bomb: When collected, this destroys all enemies on screen.Konami mark: Pick this up to cause Konami Man to spawn.Konami Man: Catch Konami Man to completely restore Kong's life.Moai Head: These mysterious items grant Kong an extra life.Speed: Kong should probably be staying away from "speed", but it increases his movement speed and jump distance if picked up. The effect is permanent until Kong dies.Power Rock: Increases the power of Kong's rocks one level. The effect is permanent until Kong dies.Rock case: This increases the number of Rocks Kong can hold by 10, to a maximum of 99. Once again the effect is permanent until Kong dies.Artificial heart: These permanently increase Kong's HP by 100... barring a death, of course.Star rock: Kong is rendered invincible for a short period.Key: These are needed to rescue Lady Kong. They are only found after a boss is defeated.[CR]Areas[CR]These are the various locations Kong must traverse in order to find the keys to save Lady Kong. Keep in mind there is no linear order; depending on what warps Kong takes he may end up in a much later area that could be too hard for Kong without having him power up more! Outside the military base in area 1.[CR]Area 1: A military base. Kong begins the game in this area, escaping from a lab apparently located around here. Part of the area is radioactive and loops endlessly; Kong must find the correct route through! The boss is a giant snail creature named King Pound.[CR]Area 2: A jungle-covered archipelago with ruins of an ancient civilization. Be careful as some of the forests slow down Kong's movement. The boss is King Spider; be careful of his webs, which can freeze Kong!They're hatching hideous fiends in this lab![CR]Area 3: A dark and evil research laboratory. Biological horrors such as flying cat heads and floating mirrors stalk the halls, waiting to strike when Kong lease expects it. The boss is a trio of "King Lizards", fire-breathing fiends that resemble D&amp;D's take on the basilisk.[CR]Area 4: World 4: A city run by a repressive government, located by the sea. All individual thought is forbidden; silence is golden. Tanks patrol the street to maintain public order and obedience... and to destroy Kong. The boss of this area is a giant scallop called "King Pearl".[CR]Area 5: A normal, calm City. Kong explodes upon this community like the force of nature he is! The boss of this area is a stone fiend called King Beast; it vaguely resembles Tetran core of Gradius fame, sporting four rotating limbs.[CR]Area 6: Much like area 5, but now at night and near an amusement park. The boss is a foul and disgusting slime beast named "King Slime"... smaller slimes slough off its body in droves.[CR]Area 7: High atop some mountains, near strange futuristic-structures. Perhaps Kong is not only warping from world to world, but traveling through time? Who knows? All that matters is Lady Kong. There are many places for Kong to fall to his death here. The boss is the terrifying King Dragon... his head is his only weak point![CR]Area 8: Kong enters a city again on his journey; he's close now, very close. Not even the terrifying giant ducks that stalk the streets can keep him from that key! The boss is a giant bee with a deadly sting, the "King Bee"!Kong's greatest fight.[CR]Area 9: Finally, the secret location where Lady Kong is being held has been found! Kong must find secret passages to navigate in this treacherous and frightening labyrinth... But for what purpose could Lady Kong have been transported to this dire location? Beware, for the ultimate obstacle stands in the way of Kong's beloved: an army of Cybot Kongs! Will Kong triumph?[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue[CR]At the game over screen, press the following buttons to continue on the stage you were in:</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]King of Kings, not to be mistaken for the unlicensed NES bible game, is a fantasy-themed strategy game from Atlus. It plays something like Famicom/Advance Wars or Daisenryaku, where the goal is to quickly conquer locations by producing a lot of units each turn and sending them against enemy forces. As with those games, there is also a little close-up graphic of the two units whenever they meet for battle, which shows how the two sides are faring in the conflict.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hidden Message[CR]At the game save screen, select the fourth slot, then enter Ootani Tomoko as your name (in Japanese, of course) or Abe Hiromi then before entering confirmation option, hold A or B or both on the second controller.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hidden Map[CR]On the ending screen, do not press any buttons for 30 minutes.  After 30 minutes, press a button and "PRESENT FOR YOU" will appear on the screen.  You will then go to a bonus map.</plot>

				<title_clean>King's Knight</title_clean>
				<plot>King's Knight is a fantasy-themed top-down shooter where four heroes have to unite to defeat a dragon and rescue a princess in despair. It was one of the first games published by Square Soft (now one-half of Square Enix). King's Knight is a variation on Konami's Knightmare which sold extremely well.[CR]The first four stages involve you powering up your characters as far as they can go, picking up shields (to increase defense), boots (to increase speed), swords (to increase attack power), and spell icons (which will be required to be held by everyone for the final storm on the castle), defeating monsters along the way. The power-ups are hidden underneath mountains, rocks, and houses. Nearly everything can be shot at and destroyed. The heroes are, in order:[CR]Ray Jack, the Knight, who possesses strong attacking power;[CR]Kaliva, the Wizard, who is good with magic and jumping;[CR]Barusa, the Monster, who has a strong defense; and[CR]Toby, the Thief, who can move swiftly.[CR]It is necessary to keep all four heroes alive for the fifth and final stage, because there are certain points that the group cannot get past if one of the party members has died.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Revive Player[CR]After beating the first four stages, if you die, reset and press Select on controller one. Select the player to revive, then hold A and press Start.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The game objective is to line up colored blocks into rows of similar colors to make them disappear. Atari Games originally released it as a coin-op follow up to Tetris, which they were tangled in a legal dispute about at the time. Klax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen which rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of colored blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area. By moving this left and right, the player can catch the blocks and deposit them in the playing area. Failure to catch any block results in it falling down the gap between the conveyor belt and playing area and one drop being used. Once all of the drops are used, the player is given a chance to continue. Otherwise, the game ends. (In the original coin-op, the game ends when all drops are used.)[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]A U.S military base has been raided by terrorists and the player has to hunt them down and defeat them under a strict time limit.[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Knight Rider is a transcontinental racing game that also has enemy cars that the player can gun down with KITT's weaponry. At the end of each course is an boss battle encounter with the truck carrying the nuke; doing enough damage causes the truck to drive off. Michael and KITT also have to reach the end of each stage within a strict time-limit; a feature common to racing games at the time.[CR]Between stages Michael and his technician Bonnie can upgrade KITT with upgrade points that are occasionally found from friendly trucks on the road. These let KITT do more damage with his weapons, be more durable, be faster and so on. Unfortunately, the one thing KITT can't do in this game is speak.[CR]The course the terrorists (and, thus, the game) follows across the North American continent passes through the following cities:Los Angeles, CaliforniaSan Francisco, CaliforniaSeattle, WashingtonSalt Lake City, UtahDenver, ColoradoSt. Louis, MissouriChicago, IllinoisToronto, Ontario (Canada)Boston, MassachusettsNew York, New YorkWashington, DCMiami, FloridaHouston, TexasPhoenix, ArizonaLas Vegas, NevadaLos Angeles (again)[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]According to Activision CEO Bobby Kotick, an intern in the Japanese office sold the rights for Knight Rider to a NES licensee for $400,000. The deal was they got to develop and publish the game in Japan, then Activision could sell that game to publishers everywhere else. The problem was Activision didn't own the rights for Knight Rider. They had to rush out and get after the deal had been made. (Game Informer, Issue 202, February 2010.)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]During gameplay, pause the game then press and hold Up, Left, A &amp; B and press Select to change weapons. Now, press Start and you should skip right to the boss of the level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Passwords[CR]Note that this password can also be done via a button code, as described above. This only works on US releases, however.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Start with maxed-out Gas, Shield, and Engine upgrades in Mission Mode[CR]CAUTION:  You will not be able to proceed past Level 10 (Washington, DC) with this cheat due to a bug that crashes the game at the upgrade screen.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Buy a few extra seconds[CR]When the time limit runs out, you can keep using the Turbo Boost button for as long as you have fuel to do so. (You will actually gain a little speed for a second or two.) As long as you can keep your speed above 0 MPH and reach the boss battle area, your game will continue.</plot>

				<plot>The greatest athletes from around the world have gathered for the grandest sporting spectacle since the golden age of Greece. This pressure-packed competition is as fierce as a starved lion. Surviving is a matter of sweat and concentration in Taekwondo, pole vaulting, canoeing, skeet shooting, hammer throwing, high diving, archery, hurdles, gymnastics, hang gliding, pistol firing, arm wrestling, fencing, triple jumping and swimming... Whew! Wears you out just to read them all. The odds in Vegas say you don't have enough strength, stamina or skill, but you know better. And as long as you win, you're the crowd favorite. But lose, and you might as well turn in your jockstrap and joystick.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Win Hammer Throw instantly[CR]In the Hammer Throw event, start spinning the d-pad counter-clockwise, and when your character starts flashing, let the bar at the bottom drop until there's only two or three percent left. Then press and continue to hold A until the angle percentage can't go any higher. When it lands you'll see that the game will show it went 92 meters.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Koushien is the first game in K Amusement's Koushien series of baseball games that focuses on the highschool level of competition. Koushien refers to the stadium where the final of the national highschool league takes place. It takes a leaf from the book of many other NES/Famicom baseball games, like Namco's Family Stadium, by depicting the batsman at the bottom of the screen and the pitcher at the top. Though it has realistically proportioned athletes, the presentation and idle animations are somewhat comical and the game overall leans on an arcade experience rather than being super realistic.[CR]Koushien was followed by multiple sequels, however the first game was the only one in its series to be released on the original Famicom. Future games would appear on the Super Famicom and PlayStation as well as other, newer consoles.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret Team[CR]Press and hold the A button and then press Reset. While the intro cutscene is scrolling and before title screen appears, press Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B and A. If done right, the first player's default home place will be Touzainanboku and the team name will be Kuoshien Koukou.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kyuukyoku Harikiri Stadium is a Famicom baseball game published by Taito, though the exact developer (Taito generally outsourced their Famicom games to independent developers like TOSE or Micronics) is uncertain. The name actually means something like "Ultimate Excitement Stadium" and "Harikiri" is not to be confused with "Harakiri", meaning ritual suicide by disembowelment. For one thing, baseball bats are too blunt.[CR]The game uses the then-standard baseball game mold, popularized by games like Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium (RBI Baseball) and Moero! Pro Yakyuu (Bases Loaded). Both batting and pitching are viewed from behind the position the player currently occupies, and the screen switches to an overhead view of the field once the ball has been hit. All fielders move when the D-pad is pressed, rather than the player controlling just the closest.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Work-RAM Test[CR]Note that this code requires a specially-modified NES controller such that all four D-Pad buttons can be pressed simultaneously. Press all four D-Pad buttons on the second player's controller, then press A on the first player's controller to execute the test.</plot>

Like its predecessor, it is a straightforward baseball simulation game for the Famicom. Unlike Bases Loaded or R.B.I. Baseball the series has no American equivalent.[CR]Besides a roster update and a few graphical improvements there is little difference between this and the previous game in the series. This process of having minor incremental improvements between annual releases would eventually become common practice in console sports games.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Labyrinth</title_clean>
				<plot>Labyrinth is a maze game similar to Gauntlet, but with a more definite goal and some adventure elements. It is based upon the Jim Henson film of the same name incorporates many scenes from the movie as areas with the maze.[CR]The goal of the game is to collect twelve coins Sara can use to buy back her baby brother from his kidnapper, the goblin king, Jareth. There is one coin in each of the twelve mazes surrounding the central castle. At first only a few of the mazes are accessible; however, upon collecting a section of a broken key, of which there is also one per region, Sara is sent to a hub where a friendly goblin will open up a new area. Each section of the maze has its own gimmick, for instance the Hedge Maze rearranges itself as the player wanders through it, and the Fieries' Forest is filled with teleports. The areas are also connected via a large underground maze. Upon gaining all the sections of the key Sara can open the door to the castle and enter the final series of mazes, however, she cannot win if she has not collected all of the coins.[CR]Throughout all this Sara is constant beset by enemies at which she must throw a neverending supply of stones to dissipate.  Her stones can be upgraded eventually and she can also gain the favor of her friends from the movie who will follow her around and try to help her shoot at her aggressors.[CR]All of this must be done in no more than 13 minutes or the game must be restarted, and every time an enemy attacks Sara she loses a few more seconds.  However, there are several ways to gain more time, and part of winning the game is balancing actually solving the maze and spending time searching for minutes to do just that.</plot>

				<plot>In 22th century, mankind has left the Earth. A new space epoch began, called the Isis era. Human beings built an oasis in deep space, a space station called LaGrange Point. From there, they could send expeditions to remote planets and to explore the space. You control a young pilot named Jin. One day, when you descend into LaGrange from your space ship, you are attacked by mysterious robotic invaders. Your task is now to travel through space and to find out the cause of the assault. But you don't even suspect you'll soon be involved in a deep mystery that was destined long time ago...[CR]"LaGrange Point" is one of the few old-school console-style RPGs to be set in a science fiction environment and to feature space flights. The combat system requires you to use special points (called BP) in order to perform simple attacks, cast spells, and use various techniques that will cost you your HP. You fight random monsters and bosses in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, like in Phantasy Star series.</plot>

It features and is named for Japanese TV personality La Salle Ishii and focuses on a beleagured manager (the protagonist, named by the player) and his three-member up-and-coming J-Pop band "Childs". In order to get the fame and funding necessary to make Childs a big hit, the player (as the manager) must "fight" various stressed out officials and convince them to give the band royalties, equip the band with the equipment they need to perform and fly across Japan setting up deals and procuring more money. Also, the party operates in battle as a single entity - each piece of equipment also applies to every band member simultaneously.[CR]The game plays almost identically to Dragon Quest, but is made considerably stranger by its modern Japanese setting and unusual premise.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Debug Options[CR]Name your character with the following Japanese syllables - "yu u yu o [space] ta i mi so".

				<title_clean>Last Armageddon</title_clean>
				<plot>The Earth has changed. We don't know yet what happened to humanity, but we know it was eradicated. The new Earth is called Makai - the Demon World. Generations of mythological creatures dwell upon the planet, from which the human being has mysteriously disappeared. One day, a wave of energy hits the Earth. The leaders of the demons realize that a robotic alien race from outer space threatens their existence. The explosion turns earth into a wasteland. Many demons die in the chaos of destruction. It is now up to the remaining demons to fend off the alien invaders, to bring back peace to the demonic race, and perhaps to find out more about the tragic fate of humanity.[CR]Last Armageddon can be described as a post-apocalyptic  Final Fantasy. Instead of a party of four light warriors who fight hordes of demons, you have a party of four demons who fight... no, not hordes of light warriors, but mysterious robot-like aliens. The turn-based fights are viewed from third-person perspective and are very similar to the battles of early NES Final Fantasies. The demons can attack, cast offensive and defensive magic, and use special skills. Once they reach a high enough level, they morph into stronger forms with more powerful skills.[CR]Dungeon areas are done in pseudo-3D and are viewed from first-person perspective. The player is able to set and use multiple parties of demons, some of which have unique skills. For example, a flying demon can take the party quicker to some locations, avoiding random encounters.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Change Movement Speed[CR]During the game, while walking on the map, press Up + B to switch between slow and fast movement.</plot>

				<title_clean>Layla</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Layla is a side-scrolling action game from dB-Soft that followed in the wake of Metroid's success. Much like that game, the player is a female space hunter who is passing through various asteroids while fighting monsters and collecting ammo for her various special weapons.[CR]The player controls the eponymous space heroine Layla, who has to make her way through 8 asteroids to rescue her friend from the malevolent doctor. Along the way she must collect password disks in order to face the doctor's worst creation. Without them, all hope of winning is lost. On each asteroid the player will be required to make their way through a maze to collect the disk and face the boss monster. After each level there is a bonus stage where the goal is to shoot down every enemy formation that appears for bonus points.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The main game is a run-and-gun where the player traverses across each area shooting any enemies that gets in their way. There are non-lethal pit-traps (it simply places the player at the start of the room with some health loss). Each enemy in the game can be defeated by shooting them and once they do explode they will drop a sweet - these sugary items will restore Layla's life. Should the player lose it all, it's game over as there are no extra lives in this game; the player can, however, use a password to continue their game. The bonus levels are pretty much a Gradius clone except it is impossible to die; It's simply a chance to get as many points as possible.[CR]Layla has a vast arsenal of power-ups at her disposal for such an old game; where a game like Castlevania might limit its protagonist to his main whip and an additional sub-weapon, Layla actually allows the player to collect and stock up on various ammo types for when they're needed, which she can recover by destroying the crates she comes across. In perhaps this sense only, the game is a precursor to games like Doom - where keeping a large stock of different weaponry is a necessary tactic for survival.Power UpsRoller Skates: This makes Layla run faster.Pistol: The default weapon. Infinite bullets.Machine Gun: Fires quicker than the normal pistol but requires that the player pick up ammo for it.Hand Grenade: It explodes after a few seconds of throwing it.Flame Thrower: It burns enemies for high damage but it is only good at close range.Ax: Layla throws this ax through the air pulverizing any enemies that might be above her.Bazooka: Only really effective against certain enemies. Against everything else it is useless.Light Sword: A slow weapon that will pass through enemies.Shield: A shield that will protect Layla from all damage until its timer runs down.Question Mark: Layla shall lose health after collecting this item, but one of four things will happen depending on where the cursor is positioned: Damage all enemies; destroy all boxes; earn 1000 points; or destroy all terrain.Password Disk: A necessary item in order to beat the game. All eight are needed to defeat the final boss.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] All levels open[CR]This password will let you select from any level and you will be using both girls at the same time.</plot>

				<title_clean>Lipple Island</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ripple Island (occasionally seen translated as "Lipple Island") is a graphic adventure game where the player interacts with the world using a series of commands, such as "pick up", "walk" or "use".[CR]Rather than the usual murder mystery games which were the trend at the time, Ripple Island instead adopts a fantasy storybook setting where smaller humans and friendly animals, such as raccoons and rabbits, co-exist peacefully. The kingdom is threatened by the arrival of Gerogeru, a self-styled Emperor of Darkness and giant frog, after he kidnaps the princess. Kyle, a young boy and the game's protagonist, is attempting to rescue her.[CR]The game was never released outside of Japan. It was, however, re-released as part of a Japan-only PS2 compilation based on Sunsoft's works. It also received a manga adaptation.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Best Ending Password[CR]At the password menu, press the A or B button the following times to scroll through the Japanese characters:B 5 times. A 14 times. B 8 times. B 3 times. B 12 times. A 6 times. Keep in mind that this game doesn't have a normal empty password menu. The password menu is actually ingame and each time you access it, you get your current password. So the above button combination will not work if you don't enter it with the default password you get.</plot>

				<title_clean>Lode Runner</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]This seminal early 1980s game started out as an Apple II prototype called 'Miner'. Lode Runner is a single screen 2D platform game developed by Douglas Smith. This original concept was rejected by Br&#248;derbund Software, which forced Smith to acquire extra equipment to make an enhanced version. This resulted in what was to become Lode Runner in its final form. Available on many platforms including the Apple II, Commodore 64, Sinclair Spectrum and the MSX.[CR]The most innovative feature of Lode Runner is the ability for the user to create their own levels. The game features a level editor tool similar to that used by the Smith, which can be used to add to the original 150 levels available with the game.[CR]The creator of Tetris, the most critically acclaimed puzzle game of all time, Alexey Pajitnov is claimed to have said the Lode Runner was his favourite game for many years.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Lode Runner on the Apple II[CR]The object is to collect all the gold in a level then get to the exit at the top of the level. The challenge lies in the level design and various enemies spread throughout. The only way to combat the enemy is to dig holes in the ground for them to fall into and get temporarily trapped, there was no jumping. The levels contain only brick 'ground', ladders and overhead bars.[CR]Even though it is a 2D platform game it is as many parts puzzle game. The level and enemies are designed to test a player mentally and physically, with problem solving and quick reactions needed to clear the more dastardly levels.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Lot Lot</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lot Lot is a puzzle game involving pachinko balls and has a superficiality similarity to that popular Japanese gambling game. Instead of firing the balls around a table full of pins that change their course, the goal is to make sure the balls run into one of the four troughs that score points, with the higher numbered scoring zones being preferable. If any drop into the "Out" zone, the game is over.[CR]Tokuma Shoten Publishing is a major conglomerate in Japan that mostly publishes magazines, though in the 80s they tried branching out into other mediums as well. Lot Lot is one of their earliest forays into publishing video games, and is the first game of theirs to be published for the NES/Famicom.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player changes the destination of these balls with a pair of arrows: A pink arrow and a green arrow. Pressing the action button will switch the contents of the two boxes the two arrows are hovering over. The pink arrow goes where the player directs and the green allow follows the same path with a slight time delay. The idea is to pass over the first box that the player wants to teleport balls from and move over to a second box they wish to teleport to, and waiting until the green arrow passes over the original box before pressing the button. The walls of the maze will randomly open and close for limited durations, so the player must send the right balls to the right box quickly in order for them to drain into the scoring zones (or lure them away from draining into the Out zone). The longer the player is able to do this, the more points they will score.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]MagMax is a side-scrolling shooter in which the player controls the eponymous MagMax, a ship capable of transforming into a giant robot should it reconnect with its various pieces found across each level. The game switches from an isometric view while on the surface to a more standard side-scrolling view whenever MagMax travels underground.[CR]When MagMax finds a piece of its robot form, the piece joins onto the ship and provides the player with additional firepower. It will also take a hit and be destroyed in place of the player's ship, providing a secondary use as a free hit. Should the player find all the pieces, the MagMax's robotic form is quite formidable in combat and can even change its main weapon between a laser drill, fireballs and other powerful weapons.[CR]The game was Nihon Bussan's first NES title. Nihon Bussan was, at the time, a minor player in the Arcade market, producing games like Terra Cresta. They would continue producing NES titles for much of the system's lifespan.[CR]In April 2015, the Arcade version of MagMax was released on Japanese PSN by Hamster, joining their Arcade Archives collection.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mahjong (stylized on cart as "MAH-JONG") is a video game simulation of the board game of the same name, a tile-based multiplayer game that is similar to the card game Rummy. Nintendo themselves developed and published the game and it was one of the very first original games created for the Famicom/NES system, along with Gomoku Narabe Renju (another board game adaptation). The game was later adapted for the Famicom Disk System. It was never released outside of Japan.Gameplay[CR]Mahjong follows the popular Japanese "Riichi" rule set and is adapted for play against a single CPU opponent. Three different modes are available (in order from top to bottom):Beginner - No timer or penaltiesIntermediate - No timer; a 12,000 point chombo penalty is imposed for calling an invalid winAdvanced - A 10-second limit is imposed, chombo applies; CPU is more aggressive[CR]A full game consists of three matches, each consisting of East and South rounds, each round further consisting of East and South winds (West and North are not played, so rounds progress after only two dealer changes). The player with the highest point total at the end of each match is declared the winner of that match, and the best of three matches is declared winner at the end of the game.[CR]Left/Right and A are used to draw, select, and discard tiles. Up/Down and B are used to select and make calls.Other gameplay notes and special rules:It is not possible to go bust; rounds continue even if a player's score drops into the negatives, and Riichi can still be called with less than 1,000 points.The Dora and Ura-Dora indicators are the Dora tiles themselves, not the next in sequence.Red Dora tiles are not used.In all modes, there is a 3-second window after the final discard to declare a win; even if the final discard is a winning tile, the game will automatically end the round if the player does not call in time.Tenpai payments are 1,500 instead of 3,000.Ryanshi (two yaku minimum) is enforced after 5 honba.The honba counter counts up to 9, but rounds can continue beyond that with the counter looping around to 0. With only two players, high honba counts are common.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Force a Suu Ankou[CR]On the title screen, hold A, then press and hold Start. Continue to hold both buttons until the tiles are dealt, then release A and play as normal while holding Start.The CPU will attempt to deal you a Suu Ankou (four concealed pungs). Completing the Suu Ankou is not guaranteed, as the requisite tiles must still be available for play and it is always possible for the CPU to win first. However, this behavior can be used to the player's advantage to construct high-scoring hands. Continuing to hold Start will repeat this behavior through consecutive rounds.</plot>

				<title_clean>Maniac Mansion</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Maniac Mansion is a graphic adventure game developed and published by Lucasfilm Games first released in 1987 on the Commodore 64. The game was later ported to the Apple II, Atari ST, Macintosh, Amiga, DOS and Nintendo Entertainment System. It was the first game to be built in SCUMM, a game engine and scripting tool for which LucasArts became very well known and in which the "MM" stands for Maniac Mansion specifically.The player, primarily controlling the character of Dave Miller, is tasked with rescuing Dave's girlfriend Sandy Pantz from the mansion of Dr. Fred, a mad scientist who kidnapped her for use in his human experiments. The Edison family of which Dr. Fred is a member occupy the mansion. The mansions other occupants are Nurse Edna (Dr. Fred's wife), Weird Ed (their son), as well as one large purple tentacle and one large green tentacle. If any of the family members excluding the green tentacle will kill or capture Dave and his friends if they discover them. While the plot may sound serious, the game takes advantage of a number of B movie tropes as well as a very unique style of humor that sets the game play in a funny and mostly non-threatening light.The game play utilizes a point-and-click mechanic that became the standard for most all LucasArts game of the time period (and has seen a resurgence again in recent years). In addition to this, the game contains 15 different commands that they player may use to interact with the environments and characters.The commands are: Push, Pull, Give, Open, Close, Read, Walk To, Pick Up, What Is, New Kid, Unlock, Use, Turn On, Turn Off, and Fix. In addition to these choices, the player is also granted a number of special abilities depending on the characters that have been chosen to accompany Dave. For example, Bernard can repair items while Michael can develop film.Most of the story is conveyed through the use of cut scenes. In the game's opening cinematic, it is revealed that a meteor landed near the mansion twenty years prior to the game's event, that the meteor is sentient, and that it has taken control of the family, making them into the evil characters that they are.Maniac Mansion has five successful endings that change depending on which characters are used, which characters have died, and how the player solved certain puzzles throughout the game.Like many other games of the time, Lucasfilm Games was required to heavily censor Maniac Mansion before it could be released on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Because of this, the NES version is considered to be a somewhat incomplete and lacking experience overall.A sequel to Maniac Mansion titled Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle was released in 1993. As a bit of fan service, LucasArts included a full and playable version of Maniac Mansion could be found and played through an in-game computer.A television series based loosely on the game aired from 1990 to 1993 on The Family Channel (United States) and YTV (Canada).[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]There were several different characters in Maniac Mansion that changed the way you could solve the puzzles and finish the game.Dave: Sandy&#180;s boyfriend and the main characterSyd: A new wave musician that is able to play instrumentsMichael: A amateur photographer that is able to develop filmWendy: A novelist that has writing skillsBernard: A nerd that can manipulate/repair various items in the gameRazor: A female punk-rocker that is able to play instrumentsJeff: A surfer without many helpful skillsYour party consists of three characters with Dave being mandatory. Unlike other LucasArts games, the player could die in Maniac Mansion but finish the game with two characters theoretically.[CR]Non-playable Characters[CR]Mansion inhabitants and others:Dr. Fred: The mad scientist 20 years in the making.Ed: Dr. Fred's son whom is concerned for his father and what he's doing in the basement of their mansion.Nurse Edna: Crazy old lady. Don't steal her food!Dead Cousin Ted: A mummified cousin, found in the families sarcophagus.Hamster: Ed's pet, but don't go near the microwave with this little guy.Green Tentacle: A friendly tentacle, craving the munchies and really wanting to get his band started.Purple Tentacle: Under Dr. Fred's orders, the Purple Tentacle is bent on world destruction.Sandy: Dave's girlfriend and town cheerleader, captured by Dr. Fred.Mark: Founder for, "Three Guys Who Will Publish Anything". Haven't you seen his ads on TV?Space Police: Searching forever for their meteor. Might have to get in contact with them.[CR]Conception[CR]Maniac Mansion was first conceived in 1985 by Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick. As part of a project assigned to them by Lucasfilm Games, the two wrote and designed a game based on their love of B movies and their own unique sets of humor.While they add the basic concepts for the plot, characters, and environment, the two designers had trouble determining a genre of game play. Only after watching his cousin play King's Quest: Quest for the Crown during a Christmas visit did Ron Gilbert decide that the graphic adventure game genre would be the best fit for their creation. From there, the two went about created a basic layout for the game in order to determine the overall structure of the game and preliminary programming concepts. At one point, Maniac Mansion was a board game playable on paper in which the mansion's floor plan was the game board and small markers were used to represent characters and items. Due to the complexity of the game's overall structure and the high number of variables, dialogue was not written until some time into the actual programming of the game.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Maniac Mansion is considered a seminal title in video game history. It was lauded for its preset number of commands that made it simpler to focus on puzzlers and where to go rather than what commands could and could not be used. Additionally, its humor-based storytelling set a standard that was followed up by a number of games including the Space Quest and Monkey Island series.The game's lasting effect on gaming culture can be seen in recent years as well in which fans have created a new version of the game featuring updated graphics and audio, an episodic series of games based on the universe, and live action trailers depicting a fictitious film based on the game.[CR]Changes in NES Version[CR]Due to the strict guidelines Nintendo of America placed on developers, several changes had to be made to the game in order to be released on the NES. Things like profanity had to be removed or edited, for instance Dave's opening line of "Don't be a shit head" was changed to "Don't be a tuna head" for the NES version.Other less noticeable things were changed in order to meet Nintendo's standards. For example in the Mansion's arcade room, an arcade machine named "Muff Diver" had to be changed to "Tuna Diver", or a medical chart in Dr. Fred's office originally had a caption for the brain that read "Chewy caramel center", which was changed to "Pretty brains"The characters themselves or some of the dialog involving characters had to be changed. One exchange between Ed &amp; Edna was as follows. "Well, Mommy, I'm worried about him. Well, Mommy, I'm worried! He hasn't eaten in 5 years. YEAH, SO!!! and he's been bringing those bodies, and he carries those bodies to the basement at night." Nintendo however felt that this exchange indicated that Dr. Fred was a cannibal, even though game designers insisted that was never their intention. The text was eventually changed to "He hasn't slept in 5 years!"Perhaps the biggest change to the NES version was to the character of Edna. In the earlier versions of the game some of her lines were somewhat sexually suggestive, for example when someone calls her from the phone in the library, she says "Is this a prank phone Call? There's no heavy breathing. Let me show you how to do it." While she says some sexually suggestive things, she is generally portrayed as being pretty sane in earlier versions of the game, whereas in the NES version she seems to be a little bit more off her rocker.[CR][B]References:[/B][CR]"Chuck the Plant" an in-game object has been referenced in games such as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Tales of Monkey Island, Lone Survivor, and The Cave.David Fox in his game Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders as a parody of the chainsaw that required nonexistent gasoline in Maniac Mansion, included a gasoline can (item) for a nonexistent chainsaw.Bernard and the Purple Tentacle poster From Day of the Tentacle can be seen in the living room in the game Ben There, Dan That.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Avoid Nurse Edna At The Beginning[CR]When you first go into the kitchen at the beginning, Nurse Edna is waiting there for you, and you have to outrun her or she'll get you.  If you go the pause menu (where you can save, reset, etc.) and unpause, or switch to another kid and then back, she'll be gone.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Universal Inner Door Code[CR]At any time before Dr. Fred plays the fixed Meteor Mess game (meaning you have repaired the wires in the attic), you can enter 0000 as the inner door combination and the door will open.  Presumably, the door combination is not stored in memory until the Dr. Fred Meteor Mess cut scene plays.  </plot>

				<plot>Get those electronics back![CR]In Mappy, you are a police mouse whose goal is to to recover stolen electronics stashed away in Nyamco's hideout. To do so, you'll have to avoid Nyamco and his kitty flunkies, the Mewkies. You can slow them down by throwing the door in their face, ringing a bell to stun them, or even get rid of them for good by putting them in the microwave (Argh! Poor little kitties! Don't do that!!). Actually, you don't put them IN the microwave, there are special doors which you can use that blast the cats all the way out of the house. I'm going to assume they survive.[CR]The music featured has a very late 19th, early 20th century feel. It can be heard here and the game over music here.[CR]Scoring features a multiplier if you gather items in pairs. The items are:RadioTelevisionComputerMona LisaSafe[CR]With the radio being worth 100 points, increasing in 100 point increments with the safe being 500.[CR]If the mouse takes too long gathering up the stolen goods, a warning will issue, and then an indestructible enemy will appear and chase it throughout the level. Unlike with the cats, should the enemy meet Mappy in midair he will get hit. There is also a limiter for how many times a player can use a trampoline in a row. Should Mappy bounce too often on one it'll break, causing the mouse to fall (and die if there isn't another trampoline below to break its fall).[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Mappy: Mappy is the lovable mouse cop hero of the game. He can jump on trampolines, stun Mewkies and Nyamcos with doors, and confiscate stolen items. He also has a billy club that he doesn't use.[CR]Mewky: Mewkies (also known as Meowkies in the US version), are the little pink kitty flunkies of the bigger cat mastermind, Nyamco. They will chase after Mappy if they see him. Mappy can knock them silly by opening doors on them, or temporarily get rid of them with the flashing microwave door.[CR]Nyamco: Nyamco (also known as Goro in the US version), is the big head honcho cat crime boss. He will also chase after Mappy if he sees him. Sometimes, he'll hide behind a random electronic item and if Mappy takes the item he's hiding behind, he'll score a sweet score bonus for catching Nyamco red-handed. Nyamco is also vulnerable to door slams and the microwave door.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Mappy the mouse had a son named Happy. Happy has grown up and now wants to settle down with a wife. However, the girl he wants to marry won't agree to marriage until Happy can prove that he can provide for a family. So now it's up to Happy to collect a small fortune so he can please his would be spouse. Of course, the boss cat Nyamco and his legion of mukies stand in the way of making this an easy endeavor.[CR]The game is a basic sidescrolling platformer. Happy can defeat his enemies by kicking them. He can also perform a jump, and while he's up in the air, he can spin his tail so he can glide in the air for a short period of time, which is useful for clearing large chasms. Littered throughout the levels are treasure boxes and coins which earn money for Happy, which in turn can be spent on items for domestic living. On the other hand, every time Happy is hit by an enemy, he loses some money, though a money bag will appear allowing Happy to recollect some of the lost money.[CR]After each stage, Happy is presented with a slot machine ran by Nyamco. First, Happy spins the wheel to see a prize. Prizes range from extra lives to domestic items. Now, to actually win these  prizes, Happy must go up against one of the Mukies in a minigame. If he fails to win the minigame, he can be penalized by losing some money, domestic items, or even a life. Minigames include waving flags by following Nyamco's orders. There's also a  minigame where Happy stands back to back with a mukie and they try to push each other off a platform.  The other minigame involves trying to spot more differences in a picture than the opponent can.[CR]After the minigame is over, Happy goes to a shop, where he can purchase items for his house. Buying these items will prove to the bride to be that Happy is worth marrying.[CR]The two player game has both players, (one playing as Happy, the other as his brother Rappy), competing against each other to collect the most assets to prove their worth as a suitable husband.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 20 Lives[CR]At the title screen, hold B and as soon as the first "P" letter of "MAPPYKIDS" (the 3rd letter ) blinks, press A.

				<title_clean>Mappy-Land</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mappy-Land is the console-only sequel to Namco's 1983 Arcade game Mappy, starring the eponymous rodent policeman. Mappy-Land, as with the original, requires that the player - as Mappy - collect a series of items in each level while avoiding the feline enemies, named Mewkies/Meowky. Mappy does this by utilizing trampolines to get around as well as useful objects found on each stage that will distract or temporarily defeat the Mewkies.[CR]Unlike the original, which simply had the same stage repeat over and over as was common practice with early Arcade titles, Mappy-Land features many stages with various themes, such as the Wild West or a jungle. Instead of using microwaves to defeat the Mewkies, Mappy now has access to a number of different tools, including a cat toy that keeps them occupied or bombs that removes them from the stage.[CR]Mappy-Land goes a bit further than simply differently themed stages, however. There are stages where the player's enemies are ghosts and they have to defeat them with a flashlight, and another where Mappy climbs across vines and plays far more like a regular platformer than its Arcade forebear. Each world even ends with a time trial that requires the player collect all the items in the shortest possible time to appease his wife, Mapico. After this, the game repeats with a different item to collect, and continues this cycle twice more before it is over.[CR]While Namco published the game in Japan, it was actually developed by developers-for-hire TOSE. The game would be later published in the US by Taxan.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mario Bros. is the first in a long line of Mario Bros. titles, although its differences from the later games are significant.[CR]Comparison to other Mario Games[CR]Mario Bros. Firsts[CR]Mario - initially called Jumpman - was introduced in Nintendo's first Donkey Kong video game. There, his only offensive ability was the hammer which, like Pac-Man's power pellets, were limited in number and duration. Here, Mario has an ongoing offensive power, one that he would use throughout the sequels, that of jumping under a thing that is standing on a ledge above. While this is usually an optional attack in the later games, for Mario Bros. it's vital for finishing a given stage. Punching underneath a monster flips it over or changes its color (in lieu of flipping it over). Only when upside down is a monster safe to touch. Should Mario touch a monster, he actually boots it into the water at the bottom of the screen, scoring points and defeating the enemy. Other firsts which would find their way into later Mario Bros. titles:This game was the first appearance of the iconic turtle enemy called the Shell Creeper, later dubbed the Koopa Troopa. Mario could not, however, jump on their backs as he could later, even though the Shell Creepers and Koopa Troopas look nearly identical.Shining sewer pipes, too, made their first appearance. This time they serve as monster dispensers, and reminders that game takes place in a sewer.Many things fall into the sewers, including baby turtles which grow up to be Shell Creepers, but another iconic thing that might get lost in a storm drain is a coin. Thus, coins are brought in as extra scoring items every time an enemy is killed. You pick them up before they reach the bottom of the screen, you get extra points.The POW block, used to flip all the monsters over who are currently standing on a surface, is later employed in other Super Mario games (though its "zapper-like" abilities are changed).Fireballs also make an appearance, looking a bit more like the fireballs Mario and Luigi throw when they've picked up a flower in Super Mario Bros., but fireballs in this game are enemies.And last, but not least, the simultaneous two-player mode introduces Luigi, a swapped-palette Mario.Elements Unique to Mario Bros.[CR]Many elements in Mario Bros. did not get picked up for later installments of the Mario Bros. series. Other enemies, such as the hopping Fighter Flies, ice-patch creating Slipice blobs, and crabby Sidesteppers are seen nowhere else. Neither is the complex punching-under-then-hopping-up-to-kill-the-monster mechanic, although there are certain situations in later games where this is a viable tactic. Touching an enemy when it isn't supine brings instant death, and possibly the most notable difference is that the game is largely defensive. In Donkey Kong before it, and all Super Mario games after, Mario as a player character is largely the mover, moving the game from scene to scene. Here Mario and Luigi defend territory until they win - the scenery eventually changes, but only slightly.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Jump through floors[CR]Jump right under a floor. Right when you're about to hit the bottom of the floor, pause the game by pressing [B]Start[/B]. Then press [B]Start[/B] again to unpause it. If you timed it correctly, you will jump right through the floor and end up on top of it! [CR][B][I]Note[/I][/B]: This glitch requires good timing to pause the game, so this will not always work.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Meimon! Daisan Yakyuubu ("Meimon! The Third Baseball Club") is a baseball sim for the Famicom that is based on a manga and anime of the same name about an underdog highschool baseball team and the drama that surrounds them. The player can access the game's story mode, which depicts scenes from the manga, by selecting "Dramatic Mode" from the title screen menu. This also adds character portraits to the main game mode.[CR]The game itself is a fairly standard NES baseball game. The pitching/batting perspective is from directly behind the batter, and the player moves the entire group of fielders simultaneously whenever the ball is hit. Graphically, the many super-deformed athletes resemble those of Namco's Famista (the series upon which RBI Baseball was based), which was very much the leading baseball franchise at the time.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Metal Gear</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Metal Gear is an espionage top-down action-adventure game developed and published by Konami for the MSX2 (in Japan and Europe) in 1987. It is known as the first game to promote stealth tactics over run-and-gun gameplay. It is the first game in the Metal Gear series of action-adventure games.[CR]Set in 1995 South Africa, players control a rookie operative (codenamed "Solid Snake") in an elite United States special forces unit called FOXHOUND, as he infiltrates a fortified militaristic compound (known as Outer Heaven) to both rescue top agent "Gray Fox" and destroy a new, mysterious superweapon known as Metal Gear. He must use a variety of weapons (such as a silenced pistol, a grenade launcher, and C4 explosives) and gadgets (such as binoculars, thermal goggles, and a cardboard box disguise) to progress through the compound, rescuing members of the nearby resistance along the way. Throughout the game, Snake can gain assistance with his portable transceiver, in which he communicates with his commander (Big Boss) and key members of the resistance.[CR]While the original game was never released in North America, the game was later ported to to the Nintendo Entertainment System (which was released worldwide in 1987-1988). This port includes an updated level design, including a brand new outdoor prologue segment. It was also ported to PC MS-DOS computers and the Commodore 64 in 1990, and to mobile phones in 2004 (2008 in North America).[CR]An updated version of the original game (alongside the official sequel, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake) was included as a bonus in Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence for the PlayStation 2 (with a re-translated English script, a new difficulty setting, and an unlockable Boss Survival). This version was also included in the Metal Gear Solid 3 part of Metal Gear Solid HD Collection for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Metal Gear is considered to be one of the very first stealth games, and the gameplay reflects that. The game was played from a top down perspective where the player had direct control over Snake. The emphasis of the game was on moving through the environment without being detected by the enemies rather than focusing on combat. This is reflected in the weapons that Snake uses, which tend to be silenced, and are used to clear obstacles such as hallow walls or electrified floors. The only time that the player is forced to fight enemies is if they are spotted, or in order to defeat the game's bosses.Binoculars work in an interesting way.[CR]The player can also pick up and interact with objects in the levels. This comes in the form of obtaining ammunition or rations from defeated enemies, and colored key cards used to open locked doors. The game also has a level system, where if Snake rescues hostages, he gains a rank, which increases his maximum health, and carry capacity. For every 5 hostages the play rescues, they gain a rank, but they will lose a level if they allow a hostage to die.[CR]Metal Gear is also known for pioneering the concept of an ' Alert Mode'. When the player is spotted, the game switches to Alert Mode, where the player must try to escape or kill those that have seen them. If the player is seen and a single ! appears above the enemies head, then the game enters into a level 1 alert. In this mode, the player can escape the alert by simply moving to a different screen, or by killing the enemies in that screen. However if the player is spotted and two !! appear over an enemies head, then the game enters into a level 2 alert and not only will enemies in the screen attack the player, but off screen reinforcements will attack as well. In this mode, simply moving to an adjacent screen will not suffice; they can only end the alert by killing all incoming enemies, or by leaving the building they are in and going outside, or by moving up or down a floor in the building.[CR]Version Differences[CR]This game was originally released on the MSX2, and this original version has fairly significant differences to the NES release. The NES release was produced without any involvement from series creator Hideo Kojima. Kojima has openly said that he is unhappy with the Metal Gear released on the NES in the US and has said it is "complete garbage". The game was also released on the Commodore 64 and the PC in the early 1990s. These versions were based on the NES version, rather than the MSX2 original.Specific Differences (in the NES version from the MSX)The starting area in the NES version features a jungle instead of swimming directly into Building 1 like in the MSX version.A lot of the music has been changed in the NES version including: Battle Theme, Intro, and Main Themes. Also, even some of the themes that were not completely changed were altered in some way (sped up or slowed down).Basement layouts were changed or switched around.Schneider's frequency was changed to 120.26 from 120.16.The parachute was removed and replaced by the iron glove (which is considered by many to be useless).The rocket rangers on the rooftop of building 1 and 2 do not have the ability to fly.The hind D boss battle was removed and replaced by a pair of snipers - twin shot.The trucks in the NES version are usually facing south instead of north.The most notable difference is that players no longer fight Metal Gear at the end, but instead destroy a supercomputer which controls Metal Gears functions.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game is shown from a top-down perspective.[CR]Set in 1995, Metal Gear takes place after the event of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Portable Ops, and Peace Walker, and before the events of Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake. The player controls a rookie soldier codenamed "Solid Snake", the newest FOXHOUND Member. Snake's mission is to infiltrate Outer Heaven, and militaristic state founded by a " legendary mercenary". The objective is to sneak in and destroy Metal Gear, a new and mysterious weapon of mass destruction being constructed deep within Outer Heaven.[CR]In response to this threat, FOXHOUND sends one of their top agents Gray Fox to infiltrate Outer Haven and assess the situation, and deal with the threat posed by Metal Gear. However, after a few days, contact with him was lost, and the last message he sent was a mysterious transmission that simply read: "METAL GEAR...". The leader of FOXHOUND, Big Boss, sends in Solid Snake to rescue Gray Fox, and complete Gray Fox's original objective, "Operation: Intrude N313"[CR]When Snake arrives in Outer Heaven, he meets local resistance members Kyle Schneider, Diane, and Jennifer, who agree to help him on his mission. Solid Snake begins his mission, and with his skills, and only using equipment procured on his mission, he manages to rescue Gray Fox. Upon rescuing him, Snake learns that Metal Gear is the codename for a walking bipedal tank armed with nuclear weapons. Outer Heaven plans to use this mobile nuclear platform to dominate the world, and install itself as the new world superpower.[CR]In order to learn how to stop Metal Gear, Snake seeks out and rescues Dr. Drago Pettrovich, the lead engineer of Metal Gear, as well as his daughter Ellen. Dr. Pettrovich informs Snake how to destroy Metal Gear. Armed with this knowledge Snake sneaks and fights his way through Outer Heaven to get to Metal Gear. However, Snake begins to notice that the enemy is able to track his movements with uncanny precision, and he wonders how he is being tracked so accurately.[CR]Never the less, Snake is able to make his way to the core of the base where Metal Gear is housed, and is able to neutralize it before it is completed. Having completed his mission, Snake begins his escape from the complex, however on his way out he is confronted by Big Boss who reveals himself to be the "legendary mercenary" and leader of Outer Heaven. He explains to Snake that he used his position as leader of FOXHOUND to steal military intelligence and build up his own mercenary forces, which are culminated as Outer Heaven, and the Metal Gear program. He had expected Snake to fail in his mission, since he was still just a rookie, and when he did not, he began to inform his soldiers of Snake's position, which explained why Snake was being tracked so precisely. Big Boss then starts a self-destruct sequence for the compound, stating that he won't die alone, and that Solid Snake will come with him. After a desperate battle, Snake manages to defeat Big Boss and make his escape of the compound; fleeing the base as it explodes behind him. However, after the credits of the gameplay, a message from Big Boss is displayed, saying that he will meet Snake again.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Solid ReeseA still image of Kyle Reese from the movie The Terminator was used to create the cover art of the game."I feel asleep!" is a famous misspelling from the Nintendo version of the game that a sleeping soldier will say when they wake up.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] New Game &amp; Final Area Passwords[CR]Enter the following at the password screen...[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Reset the Timer[CR]When you escape the Final Level have your character smoke a cigarette and the time will be reset![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bypass expanding holes in the floor[CR]In the areas where the black holes quickly open up to swallow you just simply pause the game and unpause.

				<plot>[CR]Metal Max (&#12513;&#12479;&#12523;&#12510;&#12483;&#12463;&#12473; Metaru Makkusu) is a vehicle-combat sandbox role-playing game developed by Crea-Tech and published by Data East for the Nintendo Famicom exclusively in Japan on May 24, 1991, and later re-released on the Wii Virtual Console on April 27, 2010. It is the first of the Metal Max series. Metal Max is set in a futuristic post-apocalyptic open world, where the surviving humans cluster in underground villages and ruins while "monster hunters" fight the monsters and outlaws outside. The game got a sequel, Metal Max 2, and was remade for the Super Famicom as Metal Max Returns.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Metal Max was an early example of an open-ended and non-linear role-playing video game. It lacked a predetermined story path, but the player was instead given the choice of which missions to follow in whatever order while being able to visit any place in the game world. The ending can be determined by the player, who can alter the ending through their actions, complete the game at almost any time, and can continue playing the game even after the ending.[CR]The gameplay is classic RPG fare: the characters travel from town to town, having random encounters on the way, upgrading items and tanks as they go. The object is to become a well-known and respected hunter by defeating the monsters with bounties on their heads, which can be done in any order the player pleases. There is a surprisingly rich storyline, but as it is not forced on the player it must be actively sought out. A large part of the game is customizing tanks: tank parts can be bought or found, and the parts, as well as the tank itself, can all be modified. The player uses a BS-Controller (BS-Con), a personal computer system, to track data about things such as towns, tanks, bounties and experience points. Combat is turn-based. There are a large number of miscellaneous items, weapons and upgrades, most with unique or uncommon capabilities.[CR]The character classes, such as a mechanic or soldier, could be chosen for the player characters, who would fight in turn-based battles either on foot or using tanks. The player could create tanks, customize and make a variety of modifications to them, remodel and enhance each part, strengthen the defense, repair damaged parts, and give them more shells and ammo.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B]:[CR]You're Winner![CR]Metro-Cross is an early (1985) Namco Arcade game that was eventually ported to the Famicom and computers such as the C64 and Atari ST.[CR]The player is a contestant on the eponymous  futuristic game show Metro Cross. In order to win, the player must run along an obstacle course, jumping over giant  soda cans and hurdles, as well as avoiding green tiles that will slow them down. Every level has a very strict amount of time to finish with, but whatever time is left over from their first three rounds will carry on to the fourth.[CR][B]Power-ups:[/B][CR]Blue Soda Can: A small, stationary can of soda. Kicking this will earn points, stomping on it will give the player a temporary stop on the clock. The points they get depend on how many times the can has been kicked.Green Soda Can: A larger can. Kicking this will give the player a temporary burst of speed, and stomping it will stop the clock.Skateboard: Increases speed and lets the player move freely on green tiles, but jumping or getting hit will lose it. Getting on a skateboard when already on one will result in bonus points.Ramps: Yellow ramp-like trampolines often line the courses. They do almost nothing unless the player times their jump as they hit one, launching them several yards forward.[CR]Obstacles[CR]Sentient cans like to mess with the runner.Red Cola Can: These giant cans will often roll at the player in patterns. Jump on them and trip, run into them and get squished.Green Tiles: Stepping on these will drastically reduce speed. Avoid these.Hurdles: These are just normal hurdles. Jump over, or avoid them.Vents: These vents shoot what look like party favors underneath the player if they step on it, shooting them up several feet before landing, leaving them to recover for a second before running again.Mice: Some rounds have green mice that will latch on to the player, slowing them down for a bit. They will leave the player alone after a while, or they can get hit by something else to scare them away. Red Cube of Terror, relaxing at home.Giant Red Cube of Terror: This cube will rotate slowly along the Y-axis.Small Pool: These glassy, light-blue tiles will swallow the player up if jumped on.Pillars: These pillars move up and down rapidly, making jumps difficult to time.Bouncy Tires: These tires will bounce at the player. Run underneath them.Time Limit: Time limits are strict in this game, so stomp the hell out of some cans. Running out of time means  electrocution.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The main screen's theme music was later used as the musical backing to the "theme song" for Namco's 2009 PSN release  Noby Noby Boy.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue[CR]After getting a game over, wait for the title screen to appear, hold A and press Start. You'll start at the first round of every 4th race.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The first game to feature Pachio-kun, the mascot for a series of pachinko-themed games by Coconuts Japan, Mezase Pachi Pro: Pachio-kun ("Aiming For Pachinko Pro: Pachio-kun") is simply a virtual pachinko hall with 72 different machines on which the player may try their luck.[CR]The game rewards attentive pachinko veterans by having several of the machines possess quirks, such as the frequency of payouts, certain pins being bent that will favor a ball's route to the bottom and the like. Pachio-kun simply has to lean in to examine the machines closer to ascertain how to make the machine pay out. The overall goal is to keep playing each machine, winning either through a determined strategy or simple perseverance, until all the machines have been emptied of their contents. Doing so will win the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Fever Time[CR]While playing a pachinko game, press Select to open the menu, highlight the last option and press Select 12 times. Then highlight the 2nd option and press Start 7 times. Finally, press A on the first option and you'll get a message. Once in the game again, press Up + A + Start to enable Fever Mode any time.</plot>

This adventure starts in a zany Fun House. Join Mickey and Minnie as they turn it inside out looking for their missing friend. A mischievous creature may fly off with Minnie, and you'll have to get her back. Now that Minnie is safe, you must help our heroes make it across a vast ocean - on foot! Even the feisty flying fish can't stop Mickey from his search, but what about the cantankerous crocodile waiting at the shore? Enter the world of fantasy, mystery and excitement with Mickey and Minnie as you solve the mystery of Mickey's missing friend![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Minnie the Fighter[CR]Minnie, believe it or not, has one single use: in stages one and four, she can be your ace in the hole. In any given area with a ladder, maneuver yourself so that both you and Minnie are climbing up (or down) a ladder. Then, when Minnie is securely on the ladder, jump off. (It's easier going down, since you can just go down a little then leap off; for going up, it's suggested you go two-thirds up the ladder before jumping off.) If you do it right, Minnie will stay on the ladder, but you'll be off. From there, continue pressing up or down as if still climbing, and Minnie will continue onto the floor without you! Because she's invincible to enemy damage, you can use her to whup some serious butt. Now the Witch and Pegleg Pete are a cinch![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue Game[CR]When you get Game Over, hold Down + A then press Start.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]King Pamera was a legendary king who ruled the lands and ensured peace and order throughout the world. The King demon Belzebut had plans to bring the world to ruin by kidnapping King Pamera, along with his wife and daughter. The Mighty Brothers fought against Belzebut but all were defeated except the youngest, Jack. Jack must save the world by defeating Belzebut and rescuing the royal Pamera family, thus restoring peace and order to the world.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mighty Bomb Jack is a side scrolling platformer with a number of unique mechanics. The titular Jack has the ability to jump very high, around the height of one screen. He can also stop his jump at any height by pressing the jump button again, allowing for more precise jumping. Jack can also float down during his descent, this is done by rapidly pressing the jump button while falling. Jack's last movement mechanic is the ability to rapidly descend by pressing down on the D-Pad while airborne. Jack&#8217;s mobility is his greatest defense. Jack also has the use of special abilities by increasing his Mighty Power, this is achieved by using Mighty Coins which will also change Jack&#8217;s color.[CR]Players must use Jack&#8217;s abilities to navigate a labyrinth of rooms inside a pyramid in order to rescue the royal family. At the end of each main stage is a Royal Palace room (bonus stage) in which Jack must collect all bombs on screen in order to proceed through the gate. Bonus points are awarded if Jack can collect the bombs in order, the order in which to collect is determined by a lit fuse.[CR]Another unique feature of this game is the addition of the Game Deviation Value (G.D.V.). This score is given to the player at the end of a game, and is apparently a score generated by the game based on reflexes, memory, and judgment.[CR]Mighty Power - Mighty Power is the power up system used in Mighty Bomb Jack. Mighty Power is obtained by collecting mighty Coins. By using them Jack can increase his Mighty Power 3 times. Each tier gives Jack a new ability, and access to all lower tier powers. Beware of collecting too many Mighty Coins, if Jack collects more than nine (9) coins he will be sent to the Torture Room.&#183; Blue &#8211; Allows Jack to open the orange treasure boxes.&#183; Orange &#8211; Allows Jack to open red and orange boxes by simply touching the sides.&#183; Green &#8211; Turns all enemies on screen into gold coins for five seconds, Jack retains all previous powers. The manual refers to other secret powers that it doesn&#8217;t specifically mention.[CR]Torture Room - The Torture Room is where Jack is sent when he gets too &#8220;greedy&#8221;, meaning when he holds more than 9 Mighty Coins. The Torture Room is a single-screen sized room where a set number of enemies spawn and there is no immediate escape. In order for Jack to escape the torture room he must avoid the enemies until the timer reaches zero (0). Once Jack escapes the torture room the stage timer will be reset back to sixty (60) and Jack&#8217;s Mighty Coins will be reset back to zero (0).[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Enemies are the main threat in Mighty Bomb Jack and Jack is given very few ways of dispatching them. Any contact with an enemy will result in a loss of a life. Jack can eliminate an enemy by collecting a power ball which turns enemies into gold coins that can be collected thus eliminating the enemy. Jack can also turn enemies into gold coins by achieving third tier Mighty Power. Finally the easiest way to eliminate an enemy is by moving until they are off screen, once they are gone from screen they will disappear.[CR]Mummy &#8211; Mummies move left and right and can fall off the edge of a platform. They are the only enemies that spawn into the world, after a few seconds on screen they transform into one of the other enemy types.[CR]Spider &#8211; Spiders are slow moving and track Jack directly, they move in diagonal lines.[CR]Skull &#8211; Skulls are slow moving and move in Jack's direction, they move in diagonal lines and can only change direction after hitting the wall, ceiling or floor.[CR]Parrot &#8211; Parrots are slow moving and track Jack directly, they move on horizontal and vertical lines.[CR]Turtle Shell &#8211; Turtle Shells are the fastest enemy in the game, they track Jack and sprint directly to Jack&#8217;s position and move on all axes. After a sprint they usually follow up with a slower move towards Jack, allowing for escape.[CR]Fireball &#8211; Fireballs are slow moving, they track Jack directly and can move on all axes.[CR]Bat &#8211; Bats are slow moving and do not track Jack, they move in diagonal lines and can only change direction once they hit a wall, ceiling or floor.[CR]Items &amp; Pickups[CR]There are various items found in world that serve to increase score and give additional benefits once collected. Items can also be hidden in secret blocks, jumping from one of these special blocks will result in the item becoming exposed. Most secret areas are accessed by finding these hidden items.[CR]Bombs &#8211; Bombs are the main collectable in game and are placed throughout every level. (100, or 200 pts depending on lit fuse)[CR]Treasure Chest &#8211; Treasure Chests are either red or orange, they contain pickups and other items that help Jack and increase the player's score. Orange chests require the player to have Mighty Power active to access.[CR]Treasure Bag &#8211; Treasure Bags are found in treasure Chests, the value of the Treasure Bag is indicated on the bag itself. (100, 300, or 1,000 pts)[CR]Power Ball &#8211; Power Balls are a white ball with a red stripe and labeled with a &#8220;P&#8221;. There are a number of ways to get a Power Ball to appear. Power Balls appear in Royal Palace rooms automatically. They also appear if Jack collects enough bomb points, once achieved a chime will ring and the next Treasure Chest Jack opens will contain a Power Ball. Power Balls change all enemies on screen into gold coins.[CR]Mighty Drink &#8211; Mighty Drink is a red bottle with a white &#8220;M&#8221; in the center.

(1,000 pts)[CR]Sphinx &#8211; Sphinges open secret passages throughout the pyramid, typically Sphinges will be hidden in secret blocks. (10,000 pts)[CR]Slave &#8211; Slaves are green in color and are pharaoh-like in appearance, they can be saved from the main rooms of the game for bonus points. (2,000 pts)[CR]Balloon &#8211; Balloons are red and appear randomly from Treasure Chests. They immediately ascend and if collected before they disappear off the top of the screen Jack is awarded bonus points. (10,000 pts)[CR]Gold Coin &#8211; Gold Coins are found in Treasure Chests and created from enemies. (500 pts)[CR]Mighty Coin &#8211; Mighty Coins are found in Treasure Chests and look like Jack&#8217;s face on a gold coin. Mighty Coins give Jack super powers, however don&#8217;t collect to many at one time or Jack will be sent to the torture room. (1,000 pts)[CR]Extra Coin &#8211; Extra Coins are red coins with a white &#8220;E&#8221; in the center, they provide Jack with an extra life. (3000 pts)[CR]Secret Coin &#8211; Secret Coins are white coins with a red &#8220;S&#8221; in the center. Jack needs to collect 5 of these as well as the two Crystal Balls hidden in the pyramid to get the best ending. Secret Coins can only be picked up while in the final form of &#8220;Mighty Power&#8221;, the green tier. (50,000 pts)[CR]Bonus Coin &#8211; Bonus Coins are white coins with a red &#8220;B&#8221; in the center. Bonus Coins only appear in the Royal Palace rooms and move about the room on the ground. They add a multiplier to the points collected in the Royal Palace room, which can be increased to a level 5 multiplier.[CR]Crystal Ball &#8211; There are two Crystal Balls hidden in the pyramid, both are required to save everyone in the royal family and receive the best ending.[CR][B]Endings:[/B][CR]There are multiple endings in Mighty Bomb Jack that are dependent on what conditions the player satisfies before entering the final series of rooms. The best ending requires the player to find both Crystal Balls and five (5) Secret Coins. This allows the player to save the entire royal family.[CR] History[CR]Mighty Bomb Jack is considered a sequel to the arcade game Bomb Jack. It was released in 1986 by Tecmo for the Famicom/NES and was ported to the Amiga, Atari ST and Commodore 64. The NES version was later released on Virtual Console for the Wii in 2007, Nintendo 3DS in 2012 and Wii U in 2014.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Skip Levels[CR]In order to perform this trick, you must get to the first treasure room in Round 1. Grab any one of the bombs. Immediately you will see another one of the bombs light up with a sparkle. Grab the other bombs in the treasure room, making sure to grab the lit bomb last. You will be transportated to the Round 2 treasure room! You can use this trick to skip as many of the normal stages as you wish.

				<title_clean>Mighty Final Fight</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Might Final Fight is a spin-off of the 1989 arcade beat'em-up, Final Fight, for the Nintendo Entainment System in 1993 from Capcom. The spin-off features chibi style versions of the most of the characters from the original Final Fight. The game was also re-released in 2006 for the compilation, Capcom Classics Mini-Mix for the Game Boy Advance.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Haggar, finding out about the news about Jessica.[CR]A more lighthearted approach was taken for this version of Final Fight than the serious nature of the original.[CR]Belger, who is a cyborg, is in love with Mike Haggar's daughter, Jessica. He sends the Mad Gear gang to kidnap her so he can force her to marry him.[CR]Mike, Cody, and Guy go off into the streets of Metro City to rescue Jessica. While they're off on their adventure they encounter members of the Mad Gear gang.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game plays similar to any other beat'em up, but with some traits of its own. Mighty Final Fight features a leveling up system that can max out to six by earning experience points by defeating enemiesHaggar, piledriving his way to victory.[CR]A certain amount of experience points can be earned depending on the finishing move. For example, Mike Haggar can earn one point by defeating an enemy with just a punch as the finishing move, four points can be earned by performing a German Suplex on enemies, and eight points by piledriving an enemy. When leveling up, the character's health meter will increase, and the character's offensive strength will rise. When leveling up to level four, the character earns a new special move. Mike Haggar's level meter will start off at level three. If the player loses all his or her lives, the player will lose a level and all the points earned for the next level will be reset to zero.[CR]Items are presented for each of the characters in the game. Certain items can restore health for the player, others can add more experience points. Other items in Mighty Final Fight are weapons; a certain weapon is available for each of the characters. Mike received a hammer, Cody gets a knife, and Guy gets ninja throwing stars.The character select screen.[CR]The player can pick one of three characters. Each character varies in terms of strength, speed and length of their health meter. Mike Haggar is the slowest, but the strongest, and has more attack moves in his arsenal. Guy's attack strength is the weakest, but he's also the fastest, he can also delver more hits in his combo attack. Cody is the most balanced character of the game.[CR]There are two bonus stages in the game - it's a chance for the player to earn either more lives, continues, or experience points. The objective of the bonus stage is the player has to destroy oil drums that roll or bounce across the screen. Destroying a certain amount will result to either a item that will give more experience points or more continues; destroying all of them will result to two more lives added - which is more valuable than the continues.The final fight.[CR]The progression of the game is the player going through a stage while beating up and and all enemies that get in the way. Though it's not a easy as it seems, enemies will back away from the player, playing mind games with the player and baiting the player into a false attack. Once that happens, that's when the enemy goes for the attack. There are five stages in the Mighty Final Fight, each of them have a boss in the end.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]Mike Haggar - The Mayor of Metro City and the father of kidnapped victim, Jessica Haggar. He is also a former professional wrestler.[CR]Cody Travers - Cody is the boyfriend of Mike Haggar's daughter, Jessica. He is a boxer/martial artist.[CR]Guy - A Ninjutsu master and childhood friend of Cody Travers. Guy goes along with Cody and Mike to save Jessica from the Mad Gear gang.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra Strength[CR]Begin a new game with Haggar then die 3 times. Continue the game then choose Guy or Cody. You will have Haggar's strength for Guy or Cody.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mindseeker is an adventure game from Namco that tests the player's extra sensory perception and latent psychic ability. It features Japanese TV psychic Masuaki Kiyota, who is best known in his native land for a spoon-bending act similar to that of Israeli psychic Uri Geller.[CR]The player can explore the world using two commands: Feel and Exit. Exit will simply move the player character to a new area, while Feel is how the player interacts with the various objects and people in the world; for the purposes of the game, the term "feel" is analogous to "sense". The player is also able to input their own name upon starting the game. As well as the adventure game elements, much of the game involves playing mini-games designed to test the player's psychic ability, such as a card game where the player must guess which symbol will appear next.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Mini Putt is a miniature golf game that offers 4 courses, Deluxe, Classic, Traditional and Challenge. Up to 4 players can either play a game or practice any hole on any course. Each course offers its own difficulty level. Deluxe and Challenge have difficult hills and course layouts. The Challenge being the more difficult course. The Classic offers animated bridges and other obstacles. The traditional is your standard miniature golf course which requires well placed bank shots.[CR]To make a shot, using the joystick, move the crosshair in the approximate direction and distance where you wish the ball to go. When you are ready to shoot, hit the fire button. You will notice the level rise in the power bar. When the bar reaches the desired distance, press the fire button again. When you release the fire button, the bar starts to move back down. The mark where you stopped the bar moving indicates the power with which you hit the ball. When the bar reaches the bottom of the power bar, it moves horizontally on the accuracy bar. In the middle of the accuracy bar is the center line. Too much to the left of center, it pulls to the left. Too much to the right of center, it pulls to the right. Press the fire button at the right moment to hit the ball. If the course proves to be too tough, visit the Practice course option. Not all of us can be a pro.</plot>

				<title_clean>Mirai Shinwa Jarvas</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mirai Shinwa Jarvas ("Future Legend Jarvas") was published and possibly developed by Taito and released in the middle of 1987, intending to cash in on the then huge popularity for games like Dragon Quest II and The Legend of Zelda. The protagonist is a time-traveler from the distant future who has traveled to the past in order to take over the world in order to avoid a future calamity.[CR]The game plays similarly to the two aforementioned NES paragons: The combat is all in real-time with no screen transitions or anything of the like with a top-down perspective. The player character can enter towns to purchase and sell items and equipment and can also join guilds which allows them to change classes. Each class change is accompanied by a suitable change in the character's sprite: For instance, becoming a Fencer makes the character resemble a Viking-like warrior.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Warp back to the start[CR]At any time while the game is unpaused and no menus or dialogue boxes are being displayed, enter the code on Controller #2.</plot>

As in that game, the player controls one of Mitsukini Tokugawa's retainers as they gather clues and evidence of crimes in the area while either avoiding or fighting off hostile NPCs.[CR]Unlike the first game, which was set entirely within Japan, Tokugawa is crossing the world solving issues instead. The first stage is America (specifically the Wild West, as would be chronologically accurate for the 17th century) though there are plenty of other locations to visit across the world as well, including even Transylvania.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Mitsume ga Tooru (translates to The Three-Eyed One) is based on the manga and anime of the same name. You control Hosuke Sharaku - a boy with a third eye on his forehead and of terrifying power. This power is unleashed when his third eye is open so he is wearing a bandage to seal his power and remove any memories of his true nature.[CR]In the game, another three-eyed man with great powers appears and attacks a city. He also kidnaps Sharakus friend Wato who watches unable to do anything. Sharaku then, with the bandage removed, begins his quest to save Wato from this man.[CR]The character you control can fire shots of energy from his forehead eye to attack the enemies that inhabit the 5 stages of the game. He can also summon the Red Condor  a harpoon that can be used for attacking or reaching higher places. Along the way you will find places where you can buy extra lives, different weapons and an improved version of the Red Condor. Money can be gained from defeating enemies or by shooting invisible chickens that can be found in certain levels. You can also increase the value of a coin that is left behind by an enemy if you shoot it multiple times.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Debug Menu[CR]At the title screen, press and hold A &amp; B on the 2nd controller and Select on the 1st Controller, then press Start. If done right, the debug menu will appear.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Money trick[CR]Whenever an enemy drops a coin, shoot at it before you take it. Four shots increase the value of a coin. Most coins' values can be increased two times beforte they disappear, but the '500' coins' values can be increased only once, because '1000' is the maximum value of a coin.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The beginning.      Moai Kun is a single screen puzzle platformer developed and published by Konami for the Famicom, only released in Japan. In the game you control a walking stone head named Moai-kun that needs to rescue all his friends that are scattered throughout the stages and reach a door before the timer runs out. Moai-kun can use his head(!) to break blocks and defeat enemies and on some stages you'll find bombs that you can pick up and use to destroy blocks that are beneath you.             [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] The objective of every stage is to rescue all the little guys that are standing around looking flustered before the timer runs out. You rescue them by running over to their location and touching them. When all of the guys have been rescued you can exit the stage by reaching the big iron door. Since the stages are designed with a single solution in mind (although with some room for improvisation) it can be quite easy to become stuck in a stage, leaving you with no other way out than to commit suicide by pressing the select button. Taking to the skies.  Controls A = Jump B = Headbutt  Down = Duck. This has no real practical use in the game.Down   B = Place Bomb Select = Commit suicide. This will restart the stage. Start = Pause the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Stage Passwords[CR]On the Main Screen, press Select to select the Password mode, then press Start to enter it. Input the password with up and down on the Directional Pad, then press Start once you're done. You'll appear at the correct stage with there lives. There are no o's in the passwords, only zeros.</plot>

You pick the court - Eastern or Western - and you pick the rules, too. You can play against the computer or one other player. Or you can even team up with another player against the computer. You can block shots, make steals, pass off or go strong to the hoop - in fact, you control just about everything in this ultra-realistic rendition of the playground game. Except, of course, the final score. But win or lose, you know you've been in a game after you've played a game of HOOPS!</plot>

				<plot>Do you have what it takes to play and manage a World Series team? You've got all the tools. Diving stops and leaping catches. Stolen bases and precision pickoffs. A pitching staff of junkballing lefties, flamethrowing righties, and crafty old relievers. But the key is to know when to use them, on any given day or play. You can tell a lot from your player's state - the most detailed in video baseball history, from streaks and slumps right down to each player's biorhythms - daily mood and physical condition. Beyond that, you have to rely on instinct alone. Because this is the 'SECOND SEASON.' When baseball becomes a thinking man's game, a war of nail-biting drama, strategy and nerves. When a world championship rides on every pitch, and one wrong move can end your season. From the first costly error to the last clutch hit, this is baseball at its very best. A big step up from the original 'BASES LOADED'... and a world away from any other video baseball game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hawaii Team Continue Passwords[CR]Enter the password below to achieve the following record for Team LA</plot>

				<plot>Pitch, hit and run like the pros! Here's voice, action and graphics so real, you'll believe you're in the lineup. The characters look like real baseball players, not cartoons. The action moves at the same pace as a real game. Sounds real, too! The crack of the bat, the calls of the ump, the roar of the crowd when you score. Play against the computer or a friend. Pick your team from 12 different lineups. It's tough. Each team has 30 players - 12 pitchers and 18 fielders. Each ballplayer has his own style. The trick: learn all 360 players! Control and play any position. Whether pitching or at bat, control every aspect of the game. Throw a fastball, high outside or a slider. Swing for the fences. Hit and run, bunt, steal or call for a pinch hitter. Win the Pennant by storing your wins and losses. Sign autographs later.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Last Game Passwords (Japanese Version)[CR]Please enter the following passwords:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Pitch a Perfect Game[CR]Start a Left-Handed pitcher.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]An RPG based on the Momotarou legend (in fact, the game's name means "Momotarou Legend" or "Peach Boy Legend"), Hudson produced it around the same time as the similarly named and themed Momotarou Dentetsu series, which involves railroads and is more board game-like in nature.[CR]Like many early JRPGs, the game plays similarly to Enix's Dragon Quest. The battles are turn-based and the player must explore the world's dungeons for valuable quest items while interacting with NPCs in towns to receive hints on what to do as well as purchase and sell items and equipment. Momotaro is eventually joined by his three animal companions, which were also part of his legend, though they don't act as separate party members in battle.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound &amp; Picture Test[CR]Enter the following passwords at the password screen.</plot>

				<title_clean>Money Game, The</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Money Game is a stock market simulation game where the goal is to raise money through the wise purchasing and selling of various types of stock. Coupled to this is a life-sim aspect where raising a sufficient amount of money at certain checkpoints allows the player to gain and keep a girlfriend, who later becomes their wife and provides children. As well, the player can upgrade from their initial studio apartment to a terraced house to a mansion with its own Olympic-sized swimming pool.[CR]The game is densely packed with Japanese script and requires both literacy in that language and a fairly good understanding of dealing in the stock market itself (though the game does provide tutorials for the latter). It would be followed by a sequel, The Money Game 2: Kabutochou no Kiseki, which in turn would be the basis for SOFEL's Wall Street Kid.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Competition Mode[CR]During gameplay, press Select, choose the second option, and hold Left and A on Controller 2 and Left on Controller 1. Press A on Controller 1 and give your ID and password, then answer "Yes". The game will switch to a competition mode.</plot>

The gameplay is simple, in turn, each player rolls the dice, and moves that player's token the indicated number of spaces clockwise. The players can buy properties, railroads, and utilities in an attempt to speed up the bankrupting process. If all properties of a certain color are acquired, a monopoly is gained, and houses and hotels may be built on those properties. These houses and hotels can drastically increase the money others have to give the owner of these properties, or rent. Since there is only one of each deed per game, trading with other places is pretty much vital to winning.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Control Computer Opponents[CR]Before rolling the dice, press and hold Start and press Select. The computer will ask, ''To whom am I speaking?''. Choose the character you want to control and hit the A Button. When the character's screen appears, move the cursor to Game Control and press the A Button again. Now you can choose your opponent's gameplay option, then continue along with your game.</plot>

				<title_clean>Mother</title_clean>
				<plot>In the early 1990s, a mysterious dark shadow covered a small country town in rural America. A young married couple vanished from their house without a trace. The man's name was George, the woman's name was Maria. Two years passed, and George suddenly returned. He never spoke to anyone about what he had experienced. Instead, he lead a solitary life and began an odd study, all by himself. His wife never returned.[CR]Eighty years have passed since then. You play the role of a young boy who lives in a small town together with his parents and his two sisters. One day, something strange happens: the house seems to be possessed by a poltergeist. Things start attacking house inhabitants. The boy's father advises him to talk to his grandfather and to learn how to use psychic powers in order to discover the reason behind the strange poltergeist. On his journey, the boy meets three other children: a quiet girl who lives together with her mother, a young genius who isn't accepted by his classmates, and a boy who joined a gang, hoping for revenge. The four heroes will explore the world and find out the connection between the strange events of today and the mystery of the past.[CR]Closely related to the SNES game  EarthBound, "Mother" is an unusual console-style RPG set in modern times. Combat system is similar to Dragon Warrior: you meet random enemies and bosses, and fight them in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective. Instead of magic, your characters can use special psychic powers called PSI.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Avoid enemies easily[CR]By opening the Menu often out in the field, you will encounter enemies much less often. This is a bug in the game that was removed in future releases such as Mother 1+2.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Unlimited Magic Herbs[CR]While in Magiciant in the northern area you can find a red weed sitting in the middle of a bunch of green weeds. "Check" the red weed and you will recieve the Red Weed. Now bring the Red Weed to the Fountaain in the North West of Magiciant and "Use" the Red Weed. The Red Weed will change into a Magic Herb.</plot>

				<plot>If Excitebike had a sequel, this would be it. It even looks the same, aside from the 3-dimensional aspect of it. Yeah, you don't just move continually to the right; you actually go around a track. Kinda like RC Pro-Am, except Motocross Champion has bikes and actually is a good game. Up and down control the, er, position of the wheels. Like you know, wheelies and stuff. And left and right steer. Be sure to remember this, because if you don't you'll be running into every wall you see. Actually, you'll be running into every wall you see anyways. But that's not to say that it's a bad game. It's fun, and everyone should play it, so there.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]Everything's translated. Whee! You might notice a lot of the racer's names are (obviously) made up, but it's not really that horrifying of a travesty. Hell, game companies do worse things to their OWN games.[CR]Reviewer: Spinner 8[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/191/[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Passwords[CR]Enter the Japanese hiragana below for the desired effects.</plot>

Furthermore, a basic battle strategy (attack, defend, stop or flee) can be selected from a tactics menu, where it is also possible to change the characters' starting formation.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]Enter the following code on the title screen.

				<title_clean>Nagagutsu o Haita Neko - Sekai Isshuu 80 Nichi Daibouken</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]Based on a series of Japanese animated movies, Nagagustu o Haita Neko. In Puss N Boots the player guides an anthropomorphic cat named Pero on his quest to return to his proper place in time. Pero must pass through 7 levels consisting of basic platforming with several freely chosen weapons, side scrolling vehicle levels, and boss fights. Puss N Boots: Pero's Great Adventure originally came out on the Famicom only in Japan as Nagagutsu o Haita Neko: Sekai Isshuu 80 Nichi Dai Bouken in 1986, but was updated four years later to become this game.[CR]Television Appearance[CR]Puss N Boots had an entire episode of the cartoon Captain N : The Game Master devoted to it in the second season. It followed the plot and themes of the video game well. Count Gruemon, an anthropomorphic pig, and Dr. Gari-gari, an anthropomorphic wolf (the final boss enemies in the game) have stolen Captain N's power pad and zapper, using them to power a time machine. Using warp zones, Captain N, Link and Pero travel through the time periods, locations, and fight similar bosses as seen in the game. Captain N and Link are trying to return to Hyrule, Pero trying to return to his home. Pero is characterized as self serving, taking advantage of Captain N and Link. In the end of the episode Pero sacrifices an easy escape to his home to help Captain N and Link return to their home as well.[CR]Other Information[CR]Pero is the mascot of Toei animation in Japan. The name Pero itself is a Japanese onomatopoeia for a licking sound. It's also thought to be an homage to Charles Perrault, the author of the original Puss in Boots novel.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Reverse Player 2s Controls[CR]At the title screen, shout into the microphone on Controller 2 ten distinct times. Then hold Down, Left, A, and B on Controller 2 and press Start on Controller 1. If you start a 2-player game, the second player's movements will be reversed.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Namco Classic takes the then-standard golf game template and stays the course, changing very little to the formula. It has the usual behind-the-back view of the player's golfer, the power meter that must be hit twice - once at the zenith of the swing and again as it makes contact with the ball - and the player is free to select the direction they wish to hit the ball towards and the golf club used.[CR]Namco Classic is different in that the player can customize their own golfer character, or choose from a selection of odd-looking pre-generated characters, including a robot.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Last Tournament Game[CR]At the Tournament password screen, enter the following Japanese characters. Format is Row #, Column #.                                        - 2,5 - 1,3 - 1,7 - 3,8 - 1,3 -  - 2,5 - 1,5 - 1,5 - 2,1 - 1,8 -  - 2,1 - 3,1 - 1,6 - 3,14 - 2,7 -  - 2,10 - 2,11 - 2,2 - 2,10 - 1,10 - - 1,6 - 2,13 - 1,12 - 1,7 - 1,6 -  - 1,2 - 1,12 - 3,6 - 2,6 - 3,3 -  - 1,10 - 2,6 - 3,3 - 1,10 - 2,3 -  - 2,5 - 1,6 - 1,6 - 3,10 - 4,15 -</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Napoleon Senki ("Records of the Napoleonic Wars") is a real-time strategy war sim that allows the player to revisit a selection of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte's famous battles. The player will invariably control Napoleon and his French army in any of the conflicts depicted with the final and most difficult map being Waterloo, the battle Napoleon famously lost to the British-Dutch forces towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars.[CR]Napoleon Senki was in the midst of a wave of serious military strategy games made for the NES, which included the NES version of Koei's Nobunaga's Ambition released on the same day in Japan. Though limited by the computing power of the NES, the game is quite busy with the amount of units (which move of their own accord) the player must keep track of on the field at once. This is especially the case in the larger scale battles, where both the player and enemy sides have troops numbering in the dozens.Featured Battles1796 - Italy - First Italian campaign1798 - Egypt - Egyptian expedition1805 - Austria - War of the Third Coalition1806-07 - Spain - Peninsular War1809 - Austria - War of the Fifth Coalition1812 - Russia - Invasion of Russia1813 - Germany - War of the Sixth Coalition1815 - Belgium/The Netherlands - Battle of Waterloo[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]At scenario select screen press A + B + Left on second controller to get the sound check screen.</plot>

				<plot>Another action/sports title in the Nekketsu High game series. Nekketsu Street Basket is exactly what it sounds like: a tournament of two-on-two "street" basketball matches all across the US featuring the characters of the Nekketsu High series.[CR]The game uses the same base engine and graphics as the other games in the series, featuring super-deformed sprites moving across a side-scrolling stage trying to defeat the opposing team. You can pass the ball, shoot it, and attempt super dunks for added points. As with other Nekketsu games you can choose to play foul and beat the hell out of your opponents with your bare hands or any weapon you can find in the stages, and there are many other rule-bending features such as double and triple hoops that score extra points.</plot>

				<title_clean>New Ghostbusters II</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Title Screen Not to be confused with the side scrolling Activision game released under the name 'Ghostbusters II', this version was actually made by Hal Laboratories and it was not released in America. It was very similar to the Gameboy version also released under the same name and takes part in an isometric view of the world. This version of the game had a much more distinct cartoon version of the movie in terms of art direction as opposed to the Activision's version which tried to create more realistic sprites. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game's story is loosely based on the Ghostbusters II movie and as such the game did not try to explain what the events in the game were and why they were happening. The basic premise of the game was that the once barbarian lord Vigo is trying to resurrect himself. He attempts to do this by stealing a human child through which he can be reborn. This baby is the child of Dana, a person who the Ghostbusters are very close to and now it is up to them to stop him and save Dana's baby.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Character select screenAt the start of the game the player is able to choose two members of the Ghostbusters team made up of Peter, Egon, Ray, Winston and for some odd reason their accountant Louis. The first character chosen is the primary character and the second character is the trapper. The player has direct control of the primary character and is used to fire a proton beam that momentarily stuns an enemy. The trapper character is utilized to trap the ghosts, thus dispatching of them entirely. The player does not have direct control over the trapper character other than letting them know when to set the trap. The trapper character moves by itself and is invincible. Progress through the game usually meant walking around the different areas of a level and catching all the ghosts before entering a boss battle.Spot emZap emTrap em           [CR]Game Boy Version [CR]Ghostbusters II for the Game Boy was only released in Japan and PAL regions. It was never released in the US due to licensing issues with Activision. The Game Boy version follows the same gameplay and design as the NES version but with simpler graphics and less ghosts. Like the NES, the player can control two Ghostbusters at once; one uses the Proton Pack to zap the ghosts and the other throws the Ghost Trap to capture them. But unlike the NES, this version only has three stages and no multiplayer capabilities.     Busting ghosts at the palm of your hand.      Players can change Ghostbusters by touching the other members that are scattered around the stages. The only unplayable Ghostbuster is Louis Tully, who only acts as a supporting character and provides extra lives. Changing to different Ghostbusters enables you to all kinds of abilities such as using the Slime Blower to inflict more damage, invincibility for a brief moment and using the Ghost Trap freely while the ghosts are frozen in place.

				<title_clean>Niji no Silk Road</title_clean>
				<plot>The game is set in the Middle Ages, all around the famous silkroad, that connected China and the Middle East. In the fictional kingdom Littleland, the evil Zrool conspired against the royal family. He killed the king and the queen and usurped the throne, initiating a dark era of tyranny. But one of the king's guards, Radley, took the young heir of the throne and brought him securely to Damascus, where he grows up. Realizing he is the true prince of the Littleland dynasty, the young hero follows Radley's instructions and sets on a quest to find seven magical rainbow pieces, which alone will be able to destroy Zrool.[CR]The game is a console-style RPG with first-person perspective, turn-based combat, and some interesting gameplay elements. You get neither experience points nor money from random enemies. Instead, by fighting a lot your popularity increases, and you are able to trade items by buying them in one town and selling in another. Trading is the only effective way of getting money in the game. You become stronger by buying and equipping better weapons and armor. Also, there is a thirst factor in the game. You have to drink water regularly, or else you'll be dried to death.</plot>

				<title_clean>Ninja Jajamaru-kun</title_clean>
				<plot>In a realm of feudal Japanese folklore the eponymous Ninja Jajamaru-kun must rescue his beloved Princess Sakura from the clutches of a fiendish catfish-faced pirate. [CR]Jajamaru-kun begins on the bottom of a three tiered horizontal field. On each level of this field there are two enemies on each tier. The tiers have weak brick ceilings that Jajamaru-kun can break by jumping into them. Once a passage is made Jajamaru-kun can move through them as can enemies. To clear a level all enemies must be defeated, most enemies can be killed by having a shuriken thrown at them, the only weapon available without a power-up, some need to be stunned either by falling through a hole in a tier or by being jumped on. Enemy projectiles can also be canceled out by the shuriken. Being touched by an enemy projectile, or in a few cases an enemies body, will instantly kill Jajamaru-kun. After an enemy has been killed its spirit will ascend, you can grab this for extra points.[CR]In each stage at the 80 seconds remaining mark Princess Sakura will, fittingly, drop a cherry blossom onto the field. This will float through the platforms and eventually slip off the bottom of the screen, unless the ninja intercepts this message from his love. Once three blossoms have been collected a bonus stage will occur. In the bonus stage the foe is the Pirate Lord on the top throwing fire down onto Jajamaru-kun below. Here shuriken can be thrown upwards. One hit kills the pirate and frees the princess. As the game progresses these bonus stages become more difficult adding clones of the wicked lord and more fire.[CR]As the levels progress the new enemies, based on Japanese folklore, emerge. A new enemy will always appear as a "boss". This new enemy will be the only one of its kind on the top tier and all the other spirits will be comprised of the previous boss. The boss will be more intelligent than the other minions. After a spirit has been the boss for several stages it will become the standard minion and loss some of its difficulty. A new more difficult boss will then appear for the next few levels, and so on.[CR]Items can be found occasionally by breaking a brick ceiling, the items in any give stage are randomized.  Items once uncovered will remain until another ceiling is broken or are picked up. Items that alter the status of ninja have a transient effect.[CR]The items in this game are:[CR]1. Speed-up: This red ball will increase the determined ninja's speed, now he can get behind even the most cunning kami.[CR]2. Ninja-cart: This little carriage can crush anything in it's path and move at incredible speeds, find this and your victory will be assured![CR]3. Shuriken: Finding this shuriken will increase the distance your deadly ninja stars can be thrown, snipe those oni.[CR]4. Invisibility Potion: A highly potent blend capable of turning this ninja, if not totally invisible, into an invincible outline.[CR]5. Inscribed Coins: These coins give additional points, different colors give different point valuations.[CR]2. Extra Ninja: These little ninjas are extra lives, very rare![CR]6. Bombs: These two bombs can appear when a ceiling is cracked open. If the player is careless enough to jump into them after they are revealed he will surely meet his death. Enemies may pass through bombs with impunity.[CR]7. Trusty Frog: The trusty frog is Jajamaru-kun's trusty steed, by getting three different items, or by gaining four lives, the frog will appear.</plot>

Tecmo's unique cinema display system develops the story stage by stage. You piece together the puzzle, while watching the movie-like graphics. Decide what action to take. Use the secret sword and items collected during the action scenes to fight your way to the goal![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]When the screen says [I]Techmo Presents 1989[/I]:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Mid-air sword glitch[CR]Normally, you can only slash once or twice slowly with your sword during a jump. With this glitch, you can rapidly swing your sword multiple times in mid-air. To perform the glitch, jump in the air, hold 'down' on the d-pad while in the air, then swing your sword with 'B'. While still in the air, release the down button, then immediately hold the down button once more and attack again. You will swing your sword more rapidly than normal. You can repeat the process until you land. With enough practice, you can swing your sword up to 4 times in the air. This will only work while you're in the air. The glitch works very well with slow-moving or stationary bosses, allowing you to get in a few extra hits.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra lives[CR]In Area 5-3, there's a 1UP on the 3rd floor of the tower. Then, go back down the ladder to the 2nd floor, and then back up to the 3rd floor. The 1UP will have returned. You can do this as many times as you want.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Nishimura Kyoutarou Mystery: Blue Train Satsujin Jiken ("Kyoutarou Nishimura Mystery: Blue Train Murder Case") is the first game in a series of murder mystery adventure games based on novels by famed Japanese mystery author Kyotaro Nishimura. It was developed by TOSE and published by Irem on the Famicom in Japan only. Along with other similarly themed franchises such as Tantei Jinguuji Saburo and Yamamura Misa Suspense, it invites players to solve the mystery by talking to witnesses and suspects and interacting with the environment to discover who is behind the murder.[CR]Kyotaro Nishimura's novels tend to focus on murders that occur on or around trains with this game being no exception. A body is found on a Blue Train - the name given to Japanese cross-country sleeper trains, i.e. those built to accommodate sleeping passengers - and the player character is brought in to solve the mystery.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The game is based on a popular anim series for children. The hero Anpanman is the son of the baker Jam-ojisan. His head is made entirely out of bread and bean jam. He rescues starving creatures, to whom he gives parts of his head to eat, and fights the evil Baikinman ("Germ Man") and his minions.[CR]This game contains five mini-games, some of which have educational purposes. The game is controlled entirely by a special mouse-like device which is shipped with it. The mini-games are:[CR]1. Try to catch the apples Anpanman drops from the sky by running around a small field.[CR]2. Combine puzzle pieces together to create images of the anim's characters.[CR]3. Practice to write Japanese syllables (hiragana) with the help of Anpanman.[CR]4. Figure out the differences between similar pictures.[CR]5. Uncover characters' faces by clicking on empty spaces on a board. Uncovering an enemy's face will make you fail (a concept not unlike  Minesweeper).</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Oishinbo: Kyukyoku no Menu 3bon Syoubu (roughly "The Gourmet: Ultimate Menu 3-Course Showdown") is an adventure game based on the Oishinbo ("The Gourmet") manga and puts the player in control of its main character Shirou Yamaoka as he attempts to assemble an "Ultimate Menu". While the game involves a lot of food snobs talking about quality dishes as renditions of Beethoven's Fur Elise and other classical music plays in the background, it is also somewhat aware of itself with a wry and self-effacing sense of humor, just like the manga.[CR]The game is, through and through, a standard Famicom adventure game. Progress is usually made after exhausting all dialogue and other menu options in an area before the player is asked to move to a different one, or time suddenly moves forward and the story progresses on its own. The player has the standard options to Look and Talk to hotspots in the vicinity, as well as a few context-specific commands.[CR]Oishinbo was eventually adapted for a Nintendo console again with 2007's DS Recipe Shou. Oishinbo: Kyukyoku no Menu 3bon Syoubu was featured on the GameCenter CX Japanese television show in 2014.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Okkotoshi Puzzle Tonjan!? ("Drop Down Puzzle Tonjan?!", sometimes known as simply Tonjan) is a puzzle game from NMK that features anthropomorphic pigs pushing mahjong tiles around in a maze, attempting to push entire stacks down one of the many holes in the area. Bonus points are awarded for pushing certain specified tiles into holes first, and there's one tile in particular that will complete the level once pushed down a hole and is the only compulsory target. Future levels increase the number of tiles and the difficulty, adding fish tiles that cause the player to lose a life if they are pushed down a hole.[CR]Okkotoshi Puzzle Tonjan!? appears to a sequel to NMK's earlier Arcade multiplayer action game Butasan, which features similar looking pigs. The rights to the Arcade version of Tonjan were sold to a Korean company, Dooyong, which turned it into a game named Yam! Yam?! featuring a tanooki wearing an apron.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Onyanko Town</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Onyanko Town is a maze game in which the player controls a mother cat trying to locate her kittens, which got lost across the city. While defenseless and rather slow, the mother cat has two abilities she can use to avoid the hostile dogs that roam the city: She can jump, allowing her to leap over danger, and she can telekinetically open manhole covers if she's looking in their direction, which will trap a pursuing dog and remove it from the map. Once she finds her kitten, who is wandering aimlessly somewhere around the map, she must head back home and deposit her kitten back in its safe confines. Doing so allows her to move onto the next stage, though while holding the kitten she is no longer able to jump, making the return trip more dangerous.[CR]The game is the first to be published by record producers Pony Canyon, who would go on to create many more games for the Famicom/NES of generally mediocre quality. It is uncertain who developed the game, but it was presumably a freelance developer-for-hire like TOSE or Micronics.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Operation Wolf</title_clean>
				<plot>You have been recruited for Operation Wolf, a desperate attempt to rescue prisoners from the enemy. Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day?[CR]Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. [CR]You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. [CR]Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</plot>

				<title_clean>Othello</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The NES Othello began as a HAL-developed Famicom Disk System game, published by educational toy makers Kawada Co. Ltd. It received a Famicom release around the same time. A couple of years later, Acclaim would publish it for the American NES market.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Othello is a classic variant of Checkers and is also known as Reversi. Each player tries to fill the game board with as many discs of their color as possible. On each turn the player places a disc on the board by selecting a location where the opponents discs will become trapped between two of their discs. The trapped discs are flipped over to the player's color. The game ends when the board is filled or time runs out, and the player with the greatest number of their color discs on the board wins. Two players can play against each other, or one player against the computer.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]At the player selection screen, hold Select and press A or Start to enable slot machine for Player 1 or B to enable slot machine for Player 2. The mode name then will change to "Slot".[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Wish to review that great game you just played?[CR]If so, when you complete that great game, don't start a new one. Simply wait for the ''Othello'' screen to go away. When the ''Demo'' game starts, it is not really a demo at all, but an instant review of all the moves played in the last game. This so called ''Demo'' will play over and over in a main screen/demo cycle until you either turn off the NES or start a new game. For longer term storage, I recommend capturing the demo on a VCR.</plot>

				<plot>Tetsuya Wakatsuki was just an average guy, lazy but well-meaning, and a photographer for the local newspaper. Your planet being attacked by an invading alien armada tends to change that sort of thing, though. The young princess of the invading army, Kahm, comes to Earth to take part in the annihilation of the human race. She ends up stranded on Earth, where Tetsuya finds her, and they fall for each other.[CR]They decide that if they were to get married, the two planets would no longer be able to fight, and so they set off for Kahm's home planet to seek permission from her father, the emperor. Having been the one who ordered the invasion in the first place, though, he is not particularly pleased with this turn of events. Tetsuya is imprisoned, and Kahm is taken away to places unknown. Now, Tetsuya must break out of prison and rescue Kahm![CR]Outlanders is an action RPG based on the manga by Joji Manabe. Tetsuya, being just a regular guy, isn't a particularly able fighter, and at first is only equipped with a sword, though he can eventually find other weapons including a gun. At the beginning, Tetsuya's only companion is the brown, cloaked alien Nao, who helps him escape the holding cell, but eventually he will find others who will help him. Other standard RPG features are also present: items can be found and stored, and some characters can learn magic. The game uses a password system to save progress.</plot>

				<title_clean>Over Horizon</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The basic gameplay in Over Horizon draws closely from R-Type and Gradius. One departure is that your ship is capable of firing forwards and backwards with the A and B buttons. There are pickups dropped by certain enemies that will function similar to  Options in Gradius and also block shots like the Force in R-Type. By holding both attack buttons, these Options can swap to a predefined alternate position. At the beginning of the game and after continuing, players can access an Edit menu that allows them to customize their weapons and the positioning of the Options. In addition to the default peashooter, there are three weapon types: Laser, Homing, and Bomb. Each of these does what you might expect, but the Edit menu allows them to be mixed and matched. You could, for example, add some homing capability to the bomb or add explosive bomb damage to the laser.  The game handles death with an instant respawn mechanic as seen in Life Force and many modern Shmups. Losing all lives means continuing from the beginning of the stage. Players are granted unlimited continues to beat the game but the stages can be quite long so it is still a great challenge to do so.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]Press and hold Right, A &amp; B on the 2nd controller and press Reset. Now, while playing the game, hold Select on the 1st controller and press the A button on the 2nd controller to skip levels.</plot>

				<title_clean>Pac-Land</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pac-Land was created by Namco and released into arcades in 1984. It was also ported to many consoles and in 1996 was included in Namco Museum Vol 4 for the PlayStation. The arcade game used the Namco Pac-Land system board, which was also used in Dragon Buster, Metro-Cross, Baraduke and Sky Kid. Pac-Land also featured parallax scrolling for some of its backgrounds, which was not commonplace until the 16-bit era.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game centers around getting a fairy to the end of the stage and eventually back to the Queen Fairy in Fairyland. Since there were the five ghosts (Pinky, Inky, Blinky, Clyde and Sue) that kept chasing Pac-Man, the fairy was tucked away safely under the hat that Pac-Man was wearing. Together they venture right and left, completing levels and avoiding dangerous obstacles like quicksand, water and the ghosts themselves.[CR]For bonus points, the player can collect cherries and other items. Also, there is an power pellet on each stage that Pac-Man can collect. That turns the ghosts blue. Then the ghost consuming can begin...[CR]When the player has made it to the end of the final stage, they are awarded with a pair of magical boots. Those are helpful, as they allow continuous jumps in the air as Pac-Man returns home. Once he is home, he is greeted by Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man. If playing the US release, Pac-Man is also greeted by Sourpuss and Chomp-Chomp (from the Pac-Man cartoon).[CR]Then, if the player chooses, Pac-Man starts another journey with the same objective but with increased difficulty.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Additional bonus points[CR]Complete a level. You will be at the "BREAK TIME" screen. Now when the music stops at the "BREAK TIME" screen, jump. As long as Pac-Man is still in the air when the game stops, you will earn an additional 10-7650 bonus points along with the bonus points you get for the remaining time that wasn't used while in a level. The amount of points you get depends on how close Pac-Man is to the ground when he lands without touching it. You can do this at the end of every level.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]An important icon of arcade gaming[CR]Originally titled Puck Man, Pac-Man hit the arcade scene first in Japan when Namco released it on May 22, 1980. Shortly after receiving a lukewarm response, the game was released in the U.S. by Midway. Compared to other arcade hits in the early '80s, such as Space Invaders, Galaxian, Defender, and Asteroids, Pac-Man put a friendlier face on its bizarre action and thus had the ability to appeal to a much broader audience. Toru Iwatani has said that he was looking for a way to attract women into arcades, which at the time were almost exclusively male locations. Having discarded ideas for a fashion based game and a love simulator, he had a eureka moment after a meal with his girlfriend. He noticed she ate a lot of dessert. Iwatani realized then that eating was a universal concept which he could exploit in a game.[CR]The game was considered a smash hit in the U.S. and spawned many sequels and spin-offs, including an animated television show (known as Pac-Man: The Animated Series), a breakfast cereal, and the song Pac-Man Fever by Buckner &amp; Garcia. Not to mention NFL star, Adam "Pac-Man" Jones, and eight-weight boxing champion, Manny "Pac-Man" Pacquaio.[CR]The original Pac-Man game was ported to various systems, including the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, NES, PC, Apple II, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Gear, Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit, Intellivision, MSX, NEC PC-6001, NEC PC-8801, FM-7, Sharp X1, Commodore VIC-20, ZX Spectrum, Neo Geo Pocket Color, mobile phones, iPhone, and iPod. The game was also released as an Xbox Live Arcade game under the Xbox Live Marketplace. That version was also included in the compilation disc Namco Museum: Virtual Arcade. The NES version was also re-released for the Game Boy Advance under its Classic NES Series program and for the Nintendo Wii in its Wii Virtual Console platform. The arcade version was re-released as a secret game under the Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga 20 Year Reunion cabinet (in the game selection screen, move the joystick up, up, up, down, down, down, left, right, left, right, left, and press both start buttons before inserting tokens). In celebration of the 25th anniversary of Pac-Man the cabinet was re-released with Pac-Man freely playable. The arcade version was also bundled with compilation discs such as Microsoft Return of Arcade, Microsoft Return of Arcade Anniversary Edition, Namco Museum Vol. 1 for the PlayStation, Namco Museum 64 for the Nintendo 64, Namco Museum for the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube, Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube, Namco Museum DS for the Nintendo DS, Namco Museum Battle Collection for the PSP, and Namco Museum Essentials for the PlayStation Network (PS3).The infamous 2600 port of Pac-Man[CR]The Atari 2600 port is infamous for being considered one of the worst video games ever created. Having a very short development time frame and a very small staff, Pac-Man for 2600 wound up being a failed attempt at bringing an arcade classic home. Alongside E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, it can be considered a major factor in the collapse of Atari, Inc. as well as the Video Game Crash of 1983.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Toru Iwatani, creator of Pac-Man[CR]The basic premise of the game involves the character, Pac-Man, a yellow circle with a slice cut out for a mouth. It's said by developer Toru Iwatani to represent a pizza with one missing slice as well as the general idea of a mouth eating. The player controls Pac-Man through a seemingly-endless amount of mazes, collecting pellets (or "dots") for points while avoiding the four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde, each with their own unique movement patterns). If the player runs into any of the ghosts, the player loses a life. However, the player can run into a power pellet, which make the ghosts temporarily edible for points. This ability, which most players would consider fundamental to Pac-Man, was absent from the game until mid-way through development as Toru Iwatani and his team were fed up being constantly chased and decided to turn the tables on the ghosts.[CR]Players can also get bonus fruit pieces which show up at random intervals in each level. The primary goal is to maneuver around the level and eat up all the pellets without losing lives.[CR]Veterans of this game noticed patterns about the four ghosts and have developed movement patterns for each level that guarantee success. While hypothetically there is no ending to this game, level 256 is considered a kill screen. A bug in the routine on level 256 eliminates most of the pellets on the right side of the screen, replacing them and the maze with garbled text and graphics. It is impossible to clear that level legitimately. Because this level marks an end-point, the game can have a "perfect play" where the player achieves the maximum possible score on the first 255 levels without losing a single life and then scoring as many points as possible on the kill screen before losing all his lives. The maximum score possible in this game is 3,333,360 points. The first person to achieve this score was Billy Mitchell on July 3, 1999.[CR]Development[CR]The game was developed primarily by a young Namco employee named T&#333;ru Iwatani over the course of a year, beginning in April 1979, employing a nine-man team. It was based on the concept of eating, and the original Japanese title was Pakkuman (&#12497;&#12483;&#12463;&#12510;&#12531;), inspired by the Japanese onomatopoeic slang phrase paku-paku taberu (&#12497;&#12463;&#12497;&#12463;&#39135;&#12409;&#12427;), where paku-paku describes (the sound of) the mouth movement when widely opened and then closed in succession.[CR]Although Iwatani has repeatedly stated that the character's shape was inspired by a pizza missing a slice, he admitted in a 1986 interview that this was a half-truth and the character design also came from simplifying and rounding out the Japanese character for mouth, kuchi (&#21475;). Iwatani attempted to appeal to a wider audience&#8212;beyond the typical demographics of young boys and teenagers. His intention was to attract girls to arcades because he found there were very few games that were played by women at the time. This led him to add elements of a maze, as well as cute monster enemy characters. Eating to gain power, Iwatani has said, was a concept he borrowed from Popeye. The result was a game he named Puck Man as a reference to the main character's hockey puck shape.[CR]Later in 1980, the game was picked up for manufacture in the United States by Bally division Midway, which changed the game's name from Puck Man to Pac-Man in an effort to avoid vandalism. The cabinet artwork was also changed and the pace and level of difficulty increased to appeal to Western audiences.[CR]Impact and Legacy[CR]Immensely popular from its original release to the present day, Pac-Man is considered one of the classics of the medium, virtually synonymous with video games, and an icon of 1980s popular culture. Upon its release, the game &#8211; and subsequent Pac-Man derivatives &#8211; became a social phenomenon that sold a large amount of merchandise and also inspired, among other things, an animated television series and a top-ten hit single.[CR]When Pac-Man was released, the most popular arcade video games were space shooters, Space Invaders being the most popular. The most visible minority were sports games that were mostly derivatives of Pong. Pac-Man succeeded by creating a new genre and appealing to both genders. Pac-Man is often credited with being a landmark in video game history, and is among the most famous arcade games of all time. It is also one of the highest-grossing video games of all time, having generated more than $2.5 billion in quarters by the 1990s.[CR]When first launched in Japan by Namco in 1980, the game received a lukewarm response, as Space Invaders and other similar games were more popular at the time. However, the game found far more success in North America. Pac-Man&#8202;'&#8203;s success in North America took competitors and distributors completely by surprise in 1980. Marketing executives who saw Pac-Man at a trade show prior to release completely overlooked the game (along with the now classic Defender), while they looked to a racing car game called Rally-X as the game to outdo that year. The appeal of Pac-Man was such that the game caught on immediately with the public; it quickly became far more popular than anything seen in the game industry up to that point. Pac-Man outstripped Asteroids as the best-selling arcade game in North America, grossing over $1 billion in quarters in its first year, surpassing the revenues grossed by the highest-grossing filmStar Wars.[CR]It sold more than 350,000 arcade cabinets (retailing at around $2400 each) for $1 billion within 18 months (inflation adjusted: $2.86 billion in 2014). By 1982, the game had sold 400,000 arcade machines worldwide and an estimated 7 billion coins had been inserted into Pac-Man machines. In addition, United States revenues from Pac-Man licensed products (games, T-shirts, pop songs, wastepaper baskets, etc.) exceeded $1 billion (inflation adjusted: $2.86 billion in 2014). The game was also estimated to have had 30 million active players across the United States in 1982.[CR]Towards the end of the 20th century, the game's total gross in quarters had been estimated by Twin Galaxies at more than 10 billion quarters ($2.5 billion), making it the highest-grossing video game of all time (inflation adjusted: $7.16 billion in 2014). In January 1982, the game won the overall Best Commercial Arcade Game award at the 1981 Arcade Awards. In 2001, it was voted the greatest video game of all time by a Dixons poll in the UK.[CR]The game is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time, for a number of reasons: its titular character was the first original gaming mascot, the game established the maze chase game genre, it demonstrated the potential of characters in video games, it opened gaming to female audiences, and it was gaming's first licensing success. In addition, it was the first video game to feature power-ups, and it is frequently credited as the first game to feature cut scenes, in the form of brief comical interludes about Pac-Man and the monsters chasing each other around during those interludes, though Space Invaders Part II employed a similar technique slightly earlier. Pac-Man is also credited for laying the foundations for the stealth game genre, as it emphasized avoiding enemies rather than fighting them, and had an influence on the early stealth game Metal Gear, where guards chase Solid Snake in a similar manner to Pac-Man when he is spotted.[CR]Pac-Man has also influenced many other games, ranging from the open-world sandbox game Grand Theft Auto (where the player runs over pedestrians and gets chased by police in a similar manner) to early first-person shooters such as MIDI Maze (which had similar maze-based gameplay and character designs). Game designer John Romero credited Pac-Man as the game that had the biggest influence on his career; Wolfenstein 3D was similar in level design and featured a Pac-Man level from a first-person perspective, while Doom had a similar emphasis on mazes, power-ups, killing monsters, and reaching the next level.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]An important icon of arcade gaming[CR]Originally titled Puck Man, Pac-Man hit the arcade scene first in Japan when Namco released it on May 22, 1980. Shortly after receiving a lukewarm response, the game was released in the U.S. by Midway. Compared to other arcade hits in the early '80s, such as Space Invaders, Galaxian, Defender, and Asteroids, Pac-Man put a friendlier face on its bizarre action and thus had the ability to appeal to a much broader audience. Toru Iwatani has said that he was looking for a way to attract women into arcades, which at the time were almost exclusively male locations. Having discarded ideas for a fashion based game and a love simulator, he had a eureka moment after a meal with his girlfriend. He noticed she ate a lot of dessert. Iwatani realized then that eating was a universal concept which he could exploit in a game.[CR]The game was considered a smash hit in the U.S. and spawned many sequels and spin-offs, including an animated television show (known as Pac-Man: The Animated Series), a breakfast cereal, and the song Pac-Man Fever by Buckner &amp; Garcia. Not to mention NFL star, Adam "Pac-Man" Jones, and eight-weight boxing champion, Manny "Pac-Man" Pacquaio.[CR]The original Pac-Man game was ported to various systems, including the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, NES, PC, Apple II, Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Gear, Commodore 64, Atari 8-bit, Intellivision, MSX, NEC PC-6001, NEC PC-8801, FM-7, Sharp X1, Commodore VIC-20, ZX Spectrum, Neo Geo Pocket Color, mobile phones, iPhone, and iPod. The game was also released as an Xbox Live Arcade game under the Xbox Live Marketplace. That version was also included in the compilation disc Namco Museum: Virtual Arcade. The NES version was also re-released for the Game Boy Advance under its Classic NES Series program and for the Nintendo Wii in its Wii Virtual Console platform. The arcade version was re-released as a secret game under the Ms. Pac-Man and Galaga 20 Year Reunion cabinet (in the game selection screen, move the joystick up, up, up, down, down, down, left, right, left, right, left, and press both start buttons before inserting tokens). In celebration of the 25th anniversary of Pac-Man the cabinet was re-released with Pac-Man freely playable. The arcade version was also bundled with compilation discs such as Microsoft Return of Arcade, Microsoft Return of Arcade Anniversary Edition, Namco Museum Vol. 1 for the PlayStation, Namco Museum 64 for the Nintendo 64, Namco Museum for the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube, Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube, Namco Museum DS for the Nintendo DS, Namco Museum Battle Collection for the PSP, and Namco Museum Essentials for the PlayStation Network (PS3).The infamous 2600 port of Pac-Man[CR]The Atari 2600 port is infamous for being considered one of the worst video games ever created. Having a very short development time frame and a very small staff, Pac-Man for 2600 wound up being a failed attempt at bringing an arcade classic home. Alongside E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, it can be considered a major factor in the collapse of Atari, Inc. as well as the Video Game Crash of 1983.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Toru Iwatani, creator of Pac-Man[CR]The basic premise of the game involves the character, Pac-Man, a yellow circle with a slice cut out for a mouth. It's said by developer Toru Iwatani to represent a pizza with one missing slice as well as the general idea of a mouth eating. The player controls Pac-Man through a seemingly-endless amount of mazes, collecting pellets (or "dots") for points while avoiding the four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde, each with their own unique movement patterns). If the player runs into any of the ghosts, the player loses a life. However, the player can run into a power pellet, which make the ghosts temporarily edible for points. This ability, which most players would consider fundamental to Pac-Man, was absent from the game until mid-way through development as Toru Iwatani and his team were fed up being constantly chased and decided to turn the tables on the ghosts.[CR]Players can also get bonus fruit pieces which show up at random intervals in each level. The primary goal is to maneuver around the level and eat up all the pellets without losing lives.[CR]Veterans of this game noticed patterns about the four ghosts and have developed movement patterns for each level that guarantee success. While hypothetically there is no ending to this game, level 256 is considered a kill screen. A bug in the routine on level 256 eliminates most of the pellets on the right side of the screen, replacing them and the maze with garbled text and graphics. It is impossible to clear that level legitimately. Because this level marks an end-point, the game can have a "perfect play" where the player achieves the maximum possible score on the first 255 levels without losing a single life and then scoring as many points as possible on the kill screen before losing all his lives. The maximum score possible in this game is 3,333,360 points. The first person to achieve this score was Billy Mitchell on July 3, 1999.[CR]Development[CR]The game was developed primarily by a young Namco employee named T&#333;ru Iwatani over the course of a year, beginning in April 1979, employing a nine-man team. It was based on the concept of eating, and the original Japanese title was Pakkuman (&#12497;&#12483;&#12463;&#12510;&#12531;), inspired by the Japanese onomatopoeic slang phrase paku-paku taberu (&#12497;&#12463;&#12497;&#12463;&#39135;&#12409;&#12427;), where paku-paku describes (the sound of) the mouth movement when widely opened and then closed in succession.[CR]Although Iwatani has repeatedly stated that the character's shape was inspired by a pizza missing a slice, he admitted in a 1986 interview that this was a half-truth and the character design also came from simplifying and rounding out the Japanese character for mouth, kuchi (&#21475;). Iwatani attempted to appeal to a wider audience&#8212;beyond the typical demographics of young boys and teenagers. His intention was to attract girls to arcades because he found there were very few games that were played by women at the time. This led him to add elements of a maze, as well as cute monster enemy characters. Eating to gain power, Iwatani has said, was a concept he borrowed from Popeye. The result was a game he named Puck Man as a reference to the main character's hockey puck shape.[CR]Later in 1980, the game was picked up for manufacture in the United States by Bally division Midway, which changed the game's name from Puck Man to Pac-Man in an effort to avoid vandalism. The cabinet artwork was also changed and the pace and level of difficulty increased to appeal to Western audiences.[CR]Impact and Legacy[CR]Immensely popular from its original release to the present day, Pac-Man is considered one of the classics of the medium, virtually synonymous with video games, and an icon of 1980s popular culture. Upon its release, the game &#8211; and subsequent Pac-Man derivatives &#8211; became a social phenomenon that sold a large amount of merchandise and also inspired, among other things, an animated television series and a top-ten hit single.[CR]When Pac-Man was released, the most popular arcade video games were space shooters, Space Invaders being the most popular. The most visible minority were sports games that were mostly derivatives of Pong. Pac-Man succeeded by creating a new genre and appealing to both genders. Pac-Man is often credited with being a landmark in video game history, and is among the most famous arcade games of all time. It is also one of the highest-grossing video games of all time, having generated more than $2.5 billion in quarters by the 1990s.[CR]When first launched in Japan by Namco in 1980, the game received a lukewarm response, as Space Invaders and other similar games were more popular at the time. However, the game found far more success in North America. Pac-Man&#8202;'&#8203;s success in North America took competitors and distributors completely by surprise in 1980. Marketing executives who saw Pac-Man at a trade show prior to release completely overlooked the game (along with the now classic Defender), while they looked to a racing car game called Rally-X as the game to outdo that year. The appeal of Pac-Man was such that the game caught on immediately with the public; it quickly became far more popular than anything seen in the game industry up to that point. Pac-Man outstripped Asteroids as the best-selling arcade game in North America, grossing over $1 billion in quarters in its first year, surpassing the revenues grossed by the highest-grossing filmStar Wars.[CR]It sold more than 350,000 arcade cabinets (retailing at around $2400 each) for $1 billion within 18 months (inflation adjusted: $2.86 billion in 2014). By 1982, the game had sold 400,000 arcade machines worldwide and an estimated 7 billion coins had been inserted into Pac-Man machines. In addition, United States revenues from Pac-Man licensed products (games, T-shirts, pop songs, wastepaper baskets, etc.) exceeded $1 billion (inflation adjusted: $2.86 billion in 2014). The game was also estimated to have had 30 million active players across the United States in 1982.[CR]Towards the end of the 20th century, the game's total gross in quarters had been estimated by Twin Galaxies at more than 10 billion quarters ($2.5 billion), making it the highest-grossing video game of all time (inflation adjusted: $7.16 billion in 2014). In January 1982, the game won the overall Best Commercial Arcade Game award at the 1981 Arcade Awards. In 2001, it was voted the greatest video game of all time by a Dixons poll in the UK.[CR]The game is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time, for a number of reasons: its titular character was the first original gaming mascot, the game established the maze chase game genre, it demonstrated the potential of characters in video games, it opened gaming to female audiences, and it was gaming's first licensing success. In addition, it was the first video game to feature power-ups, and it is frequently credited as the first game to feature cut scenes, in the form of brief comical interludes about Pac-Man and the monsters chasing each other around during those interludes, though Space Invaders Part II employed a similar technique slightly earlier. Pac-Man is also credited for laying the foundations for the stealth game genre, as it emphasized avoiding enemies rather than fighting them, and had an influence on the early stealth game Metal Gear, where guards chase Solid Snake in a similar manner to Pac-Man when he is spotted.[CR]Pac-Man has also influenced many other games, ranging from the open-world sandbox game Grand Theft Auto (where the player runs over pedestrians and gets chased by police in a similar manner) to early first-person shooters such as MIDI Maze (which had similar maze-based gameplay and character designs). Game designer John Romero credited Pac-Man as the game that had the biggest influence on his career; Wolfenstein 3D was similar in level design and featured a Pac-Man level from a first-person perspective, while Doom had a similar emphasis on mazes, power-ups, killing monsters, and reaching the next level.[CR]</plot>

It gives players the opportunity to play a pachinko table with several hundred small variations, with the goal to earn a high score in the time allotted. Hidden Sounds[CR]A programmer of this game hid inside the ROM a separate series of sound effects which apparently the management did not like and forced him to change. In protest, the programmer left the following message to ROM hackers inside the code teaching them how to enable the other sounds effects.You RETARDS say one thing, then something else later all the time. You're a sound company; quit ignoring pachinko sounds and trying to put these weird sounds in instead! Do you WANT it ti be this hard to hear the balls?! I've left the PREVIOUS sounds, so edit this if you want to hear it. Set hex address AFFC to 1FAF and AFC4 to E0EE to get decent sounds.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pachiokun 2 is the sequel to Pachiokun, and was also published by slot machine manufacturer Coconuts Japan as well as developed by contract developers Marionette and C Dream. As with the first game, the goal is to help a sentient pachinko ball named Pachio-kun bankrupt a series of pachinko parlors and liberate all his miniature brethren from their flashy mechanical gulags.[CR]The game introduces Pachio-kun's wife, presumably named Pachio-chan. If she's upset about her husband's gambling addiction, she never shows it.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 99, 999 Balls[CR]While playing, lose your balls all the way to just 1. Now, press A + Select at the same time to both shoot your last ball and enter the menu screen. It might be a bit tricky to get it right, but just keep trying. Now, if you saw your last ball shoot as you went into the menu, select the second option and press A. It will go back to the game, you'll lose your last ball, but instead of getting a game over, you'll be back in front of the machine. Simply play again and you'll receive 99,999 balls!</plot>

				<plot>The goal of Palamedes is to clear the screen which is, line by line, filling up with dice. Players control a small person situated near the bottom of the screen, who can only be moved to the left or right. The number of the dice the person is holding can be changed with the B button, pressing the A button will shoot the dice upwards. If the die hits another one with a matching number, the targeted dice disappears from the playing area and is added to a column at the bottom of the screen. Pressing down after lining up at least three dice of either the same number or consecutive numbers in the bottom row will destroy up to five lines at once.[CR]There are three modes of play: The standard single player mode, which requires the player to destroy a set number of lines in order to advance to the next stage; a tournament mode in which the player has to duel a number of CPU-controlled opponents and a two player mode.</plot>

				<plot>[CR]The Game[CR]Paperboy Arcade[CR]Paperboy was released to arcades in 1984 by Atari Games. It featured a custom bicycle handle controller that the player would use to accelerate, brake, and turn the titular Paperboy's bicycle on screen. A button would cause him to throw his paper to the left, to either deliver the paper perfectly in a mailbox or doorstep, or for more destructive purposes.[CR]There are three different courses on which you can deliver papers: Easy Street, Middle Road, and Hard Way. You score points for each paper successfully delivered to a subscriber, but also for breaking the windows or other household features of non-subscribers. Each run through the course would be a single day, with an entire game consisting of delivering Monday through Sunday. At the end of each day any subscribers that had a paper successfully delivered would give a bonus. Any subscribers missed on that day would unsubscribe for the following day. If you delivered perfectly to each house you would receive double points for each subscriber, and, unless at the max, get a formerly lost subscriber back.[CR]Each day would get progressively harder, with even Easy Street being quite challenging by Thursday or Friday. The difficulty was ramped up by adding more obstacles, making the doorsteps and mailboxes harder to get at, and increasing the speed of cross traffic on the one intersection. Each run through a particular day is the same, however, so eventually the player can memorize the various patterns.[CR]At the end of the street is the "Training Course", which is an obstacle course with targets, jumps, and static obstacles suitable for running up more points. At then end, a grandstand is filled with your cheering fans.EnemiesDanger Lurks[CR]Static obstacles, such as low brick walls, mailboxes, bushes, garbage cans, push-mowers, fences, and the houses themselves cause you to immediately fall off your bicycle, losing a life. The player is forced to be moving forward at all times, and can only turn so quickly left or right, so it is easy to get in situations where the player just cannot move to the side quickly enough to avoid them.[CR]Mobile obstacles, such as dogs, cars, drunks, men fighting, uni-cyclists, skeletons, RC cars, those evil, evil skateboarding kids, and more are a constant threat, popping up without much warning, crashing into you or forcing you into something else.Incarnations[CR]There have been many console and handheld versions of Paperboy, from the Commodore 64 and TRS-80 all the way to Xbox Live Arcade.[CR]StrategyAmazing Paperboy Delivers![CR]If you're playing to complete a full week, focus on not dying at all until at least Thursday. Get as many points as you can to build up extra lives. Don't be afraid to ride on the lawns, although if you run over any of the flowers of your subscribers, they will promptly unsubscribe.[CR]A good technique for crossing the busy intersection on Easy Street is to go forward, pause for the car rushing by, then go forward quickly.[CR]The individual days don't vary, so memorization of enemy locations is key. It gets tricky, because you're on the same course and can find yourself on Monday avoiding an enemy that doesn't show up until Friday or forgetting to avoid something on Wednesday because you thought they weren't until later in the week. Memorization and twitch reflexes are the name of the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 7 Lives (Japan-only)[CR]When you have no more lives left, press Start to pause the game, then hold Up, press A, press B, release Up, hold Right, press B, release Right, hold Up, press A, release Up, hold Left, press B, release Left, hold Down, press B twice, release Down, hold Right, and press A.</plot>

				<plot>Having been sucked into and stranded in an alternate universe, you and your girlfriend must work your way around the puzzles of a magnificent castle to make your way back home.[CR]The castle itself consists of a total of twenty worlds consisting of five stages apiece, each of which is filled to the brim with enemies. From your overhead view, you must use your directional pad to move your character around the grid and push the onscreen obstacles into your enemies to destroy them for the keys to escape as well as other goodies (extra time, bonus points, etc.), but keep in mind that you'll need to use those same obstacles to construct a path to the exit. And don't forget to work fast either, as you only have 100 seconds to clear each puzzle. Fail and you'll lose a life (you start with only three).[CR]This game may be played with either one or two players (simultaneous play). Player One controls the boy. Player Two gets to be the girl. Both must have their wits about them to make it past the hoards of springs, crazy rollers, witches, zombies, and more to make it home in one piece.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Infinite Lives[CR]The password uses a number of pipes to form a pattern, just press the buttons the number of times noted on the space they belong to. "0" just means to leave it as an empty space -- 5 6 5 6 4 0 0 3 5 0 0 6 4 3 4 3</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Paris-Dakar Rally Special! is an unusual racing game in which the player must successfully win the Paris-Dakar Rally. However, in order to do so, the player is faced with a wide variety of odd challenges to overcome, a scant number of which actually involve racing.[CR]Developed by ISCO for the NES, Paris-Dakar Rally is notorious for its bizarre structure. Depending on who is asked it is either a testament to the NES library's occasionally creative and off-beat ingenuity, or a legendary "kusoge" (crap game).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Stage 1 - Preparation[CR]In the first stage the player is without vehicle. In order to race in the Paris-Dakar Rally, the player must first acquire a sponsor, some money, a car and a navigation partner. In order to achieve these objectives, the player must walk around town and talk to the right order of sponsors, executives, bank tellers and rally co-ordinators to begin. Once the car has been purchased and a navigation partner chosen (which is resolved with a fast reactions mini-game), the player can take a plane to Paris to begin the rally.Stage 2 - First Day[CR]The first day races most closely resemble an actual racing game. The player has a top-down view of a vertically-scrolling track and must control the car's speed and direction with the D-pad. In order to qualify for the next stage of the event, the player must make it through the course within a time limit while dodging hostile vehicles from behind and in front. Losing three lives restarts the stage.Stage 3 - Second Day[CR]This mode more closely resembles the Arcade game Rally-X. The player must maneuver and corner around the Parisian streets in order to avoid rival drivers. They can distract pursuing CPU opponents by dropping rubber balls (possibly tires) behind the player's car to deter them.Stage 4 - Third Day[CR]The action changes to a side-scrolling perspective and now the player must contend with birds dropping deadly eggs, bridges that collapse once driven on, rolling boulders, fires and other obstacles on the racecourse. Occasionally, the player will need to leave the vehicle in order to hit a switch to extend a bridge before they can continue.Stage 5 - Fourth Day[CR]As the player is on a variant of the Paris-Dakar course that will inconveniently cross a major sea, the player must steer their car-boat over and under the ocean and avoid various hostile sea creatures and jagged rocks.Stage 6 - Fifth Day[CR]Into the Dakar desert, the player must drive vertically up the screen while avoiding vicious desert animals like snakes, scorpions, spiders, camels and other hostile racers. The player must also contend with some narrow walls and a section where they must cross between two rafts.Stage 7 - Sixth Day[CR]At some point between starting the race and the sixth day, World War 3 broke out and the player must use their newly mounted machine guns to take down the enemy aircraft and tanks between them and the finishing line.Stage 8 - Final Day[CR]The Dakar finish line is just ahead, all the player must do is survive a gauntlet similar to that of the First Day. As with that stage, the player must be alert for other racers all around them and make it to the end within the time limit.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Win[CR]At the title screen, press A, Up, Down, Down, B, Right, Left, Left and choose Start or Continue. You can now press Start + Select, on the map on in a race, to complete your objective and go to the next area. Also, while in a race, your life counter will read "9" and you will not take any damage.</plot>

				<plot>[CR]The player chooses from a selection of animals (specific animals vary depending on platform), and then enters a tournament-style competition against the other animals. Each animal starts with five balls on either side of a large square table and 60 seconds on the clock, with the goal of rolling all of your balls into your opponent's side of the table. The match ends instantly if at any point all 10 balls are on the same side, otherwise the player with the fewest balls when time runs out is declared the winner.    If an animal is hit by a ball, they are stunned for a few seconds. Different animals have different characteristics.  For example, the rat is fastest but takes the longest time to recover from being knocked down. Halfway through the match, a small, moving barrier appears in the center of the table, which may block the player's shot. Balls can also be blocked or deflected by other balls.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Perfect Bowling is a Japan-only Famicom bowling game, in which the player competes with other computer opponents. Each of the opponents has their own name, appearance and style of play. The game seems to take place in the future, with lanes restocking pins with lasers and certain characters dressed in strange, futuristic (or at least an 80s interpretation of futuristic) fashions. This is a complete departure from its box art, which seems more reminiscent of the 1950s and 60s.[CR]The game allows for a lot of precision-based options in order to bowl effectively. This includes rotating the ball to put spin on it, selecting the power and hitting the power gauge just right. The player can also select which hand they favor and the weight of the ball during the character creation process.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Split Mode[CR]Select the Training mode, then enter the player's data. Before you confirm the data, hold B on Controller 2 while you press A on Controller 1 to end the player setup and to enter a mode focused on splits.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]Pinball was originally released in February 1984 for        Nintendo's       Famicom. It later appeared as "Vs. Pinball" in arcades on the NES-based arcade hardware that the company was using at the time. This arcade release contained different sound effects and some additional features.  The NES version, released in 1985 for the North American launch of the console, would later appear on the Game Boy Advance via the e-Reader peripheral.  The game was also made available as one of the NES titles hidden in      Animal Crossing on the     GameCube and as a download on the    Wii's   Virtual Console service.  [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]Pinball consists of a single virtual pinball table.  As in standard pinball, the player controls flippers to bat the pinball toward bumpers and other objects in order to score points.  There is also a bonus area of the table in which the player will temporarily take control of  Mario and move him back and forth across the bottom of the screen to prevent the ball from falling out of the bonus screen.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Disappearing/Reappearing Flippers[CR]To make the flippers disappear, get a score of 100,000 points. Then the screen will flash and the flippers will disappear. When you get 150,000 points, they reappear.</plot>

				<title_clean>Pinball Quest</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pinball Quest is a pinball RPG game developed by TOSE Co. and released in 1990 for the NES by Jaleco. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]There are four gameplay options available to you in pinball quest:Pop! Pop!: a pinball table with a 1950's themeViva Golf!: a golf themed pinball tableCircus: a circus theme pinball table.RPG[CR]The meat of the game where you are tasked with saving the pinball kings wife who was kidnapped by orange demons in the opening scene of the game. You move upwards through several "tables" each with its own theme and boss, instead of dying you fall down into the previous table should you "lose" your ball. If this happens on the first table you are asked if you would like to try again.[CR]After each level you have the ability to visit the store and buy upgrades, sell items, and also risk stealing.[CR]Tables[CR]Table 1[CR]Table 1 is a cemetery where the player will begin the game's quest. In order to progress to the next table the player must defeat the 3 skeletons and then the giant skeleton that they form.Table 2[CR]Table 2 starts off with a lot of forward momentum bringing the pinball right to the boss which is a witch. If she hits the pinball with her power zapping spell, the ball is sent back down into the store below, and forced into the field again in order to progress. She can also heal by using her table in the corner, which can be destroyed.Table 3[CR]Table 3 is set in what looks like a mine. The boss here is protected by several guards that must be defeated before in order for him to take damage. Also goblin enemies are found on this table who will throw the pinball back, should they catch it.Table 4[CR]Table 4 involves using a roulette wheel to get a boat ride across the river and defeat 3 ghost knights to move on. The ghost knights have the ability to attack your flippers with their swords.Table 5[CR]Just when the player finally finds the princess, she turns into a vampire and attacks. After defeating her, destroying her fake throne gives access to access the final table.Table 6[CR]Finally at the last level defeat the Devil who is holding the princess. He has the ability to freeze the bumpers when the image of his head's eyes glow white.Ending[CR]Defeating the Devil unlocks a humorous cutscene in which the pinball encounters and defeats the master: a giant magnet. Since pinballs are made of metal it makes perfect sense![CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Pooyan</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]In Pooyan, the player controls a pig confined to an elevator on the right side of the screen. The player can move the elevator up and down, and fire arrows which fly to the left. Every few seconds, a meat arrow appears at the top of the elevator's rope. Moving the elevator to the top of the screen will pick up the meat arrow, automatically firing it the next time the fire button is pressed.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] consists of an endless cycle of three rounds. In the first round of each cycle, the wolves begin at the top of the screen, and attempt to descend using balloons while throwing missiles at the player. Shooting the wolves themselves does no good; the player must shoot the balloons, causing the wolves to plummet to their demise. The wolves usually descend one or two at a time, but every so often a group of four or five descend at once to add to the challenge. The meat arrow comes in handy for these groups; if the meat arrow flies near the wolf, the wolf will immediately fall as it tries and fails to grab the meat. This allows meat arrows to clear several wolves with one shot. If a wolf reaches the bottom safely, it will climb a ladder to the right of the player (where it cannot be hit), periodically reaching out to snap at the player. The player can lose a life by being hit by a thrown missile (only the pig is vulnerable -- hitting the elevator does not count), or by being chomped on by a wolf on the ladder.[CR]Once enough wolves are cleared, the player advances to the second round, where the wolves start at the bottom and attempt to rise to the top using helium balloons. This time the balloons take multiple hits to pop if they are not hit squarely. Wolves that reach the top will line up behind a huge rock, attempting to push it down the elevator's path. The final wolf of this round rises on a multicolored balloon that is unusually hard to pop; if this wolf reaches the top of the screen, five more wolves will appear, extending the round. The player can lose a life either by being hit by a thrown missile, or by allowing seven wolves to reach the top of the screen, at which point they succeed in pushing the rock and crushing the player.[CR]The third round of the cycle is a bonus stage. The wolves rise from the bottom just like in the second round, but the player is given an infinite number of meat arrows (and must use them -- regular arrows are not available). The player receives bonus points for clearing the wolves using as few shots as possible.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Popeye</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Description:[/B][CR]Popeye must catch hearts, musical notes, or letter from the word "HELP" that his girlfriend Olive Oyl, who is located at the top of the screen, is tossing down. These items slowly floating items descend to the bottom of the screen and eventually 'break' unless Popeye can collect them. Popeye was released in 1982.[CR]Popeye's nemesis, Bluto, pursues him throughout each of the repeating three stages. The Sea Hag also appears to hurl bottles, etc. at our hero. Sweet Pea and Wimpy also make appearances but only serve to provide opportunities to score more points. [CR]The three stages consist of the dock level, the street level, and the ship level. Difficulty increases each time the player completes the set of stages. Controls consist of an 8-way joystick and a 'punch' button.[CR]History &amp; Design[CR] Original Arcade Cabinet[CR]Popeye was released by Nintendo in 1982. It's cabinet is the same design as the earlier more recognizable Donkey Kong and the later Donkey Kong Jr. cabinets. A cocktail table version was also released. The game was designed by Genyo Takeda and a young upstart designer named Shigeru Miyamoto. The Popeye characters were originally going to be used for Donkey Kong, but Nintendo decided to go with an original character creation that evolved into the iconic Mario. The CPU was a Z80 Chip running at 4MHz. Sound was produced using a AY8910 chip running at 2MHz. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Three Stages of Popeye[CR]THE DOCK STAGE - Popeye must catch 24 hearts that Olive Oyl tosses down one at a time. The HUD displays how many hearts the player has collected. If a heart reaches the bottom of the screen, the player will lose a life if he doesn't retrieve the breaking heart after about 10 seconds. [CR]Bluto chases Popeye throughout the stage. There are two ways he can be temporarily disposed of. One is by punching the signature can of spinach that will periodically appear on the sides of the screen. Once the can is punched, Popeye gets stong and turns red for about 10 seconds and has the ability to punch Bluto, sending him bouncing across the screen and into the sea. Catching hearts while in this 'red mode' will also net double points. The player will get 3000 points knocking out Bluto but he will shortly climb back out and continue his pursuit. The second way he can be incapacitated is by hitting a punching bag that dislodges a bucket. If timed right, the bucket will fall on Bluto's head giving the player 2000 points and some time to grabs some more hearts before he eventually pulls the bucket off. [CR]Both Bluto and the Sea Hag like to throw bottles at Popeye. These bottles can be broken by punching them. Bluto throws his bottles in groups of four and the Sea Hag will periodically show up on the side of the screen, throw one and disappear. Sometimes there will will be one on each side and they'll simultaneously throw a bottle, attempting to 'sandwich' Popeye between them is he isn't fast enough with his punches. Bluto can also jump up to a higher level or reach down to a lower level to knock Popeye out. Players should take caution when passing Bluto directly above or below him. [CR]THE STREET STAGE - This stage is similar to the first but features a different level layout and Olive throws musical notes instead of hearts. There is also a seesaw located in the lower left corner that, if timed right, allows Popeye to be launched in the air, thanks to Wimpy standing on the other end. Once in the air, Popeye can touch Sweet Pea for a point bonus who is floating above with a balloon. [CR]THE SHIP STAGE - The final stage features similar gameplay with two different features. One is there is a sliding platform at the top. Second each time Popeye catches one of the H-E-L-P letters that Olive tosses him, a ladder step will appear. Once enough letters are caught and the ladder is completed, Popeye can climb up and rescue Olive. The Sea Hag's pet vulture will also come out on the left side of the screen. Popeye can punch it continuously for points.[CR]Once Popeye rescues Olive, players are treated to a short intermission where Popeye's theme song is played while his face appears on the screen, blowing his signature "toot, toot" on his pipe. Players are then returned to the first stage again with increased difficulty. The Sea Hag now send bouncing skulls at Popeye, which are more difficult to punch. They will also fall down from an above level and knock him on the head if he is walking directly below. [CR]Ports[CR]Popeye was ported to several popular home consoles in subsequent years including the Atari 2600 and 5200, Intellivision, Colecovision, Odyssey2, and eventually came full circle releasing on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Ports to computer systems included the Texas Instruments TI-99, Atari XL, and Commodore 64. A mobile phone version was also released in 2008.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Description:[/B][CR]Popeye must catch hearts, musical notes, or letter from the word "HELP" that his girlfriend Olive Oyl, who is located at the top of the screen, is tossing down. These items slowly floating items descend to the bottom of the screen and eventually 'break' unless Popeye can collect them. Popeye was released in 1982.[CR]Popeye's nemesis, Bluto, pursues him throughout each of the repeating three stages. The Sea Hag also appears to hurl bottles, etc. at our hero. Sweet Pea and Wimpy also make appearances but only serve to provide opportunities to score more points. [CR]The three stages consist of the dock level, the street level, and the ship level. Difficulty increases each time the player completes the set of stages. Controls consist of an 8-way joystick and a 'punch' button.[CR]History &amp; Design[CR] Original Arcade Cabinet[CR]Popeye was released by Nintendo in 1982. It's cabinet is the same design as the earlier more recognizable Donkey Kong and the later Donkey Kong Jr. cabinets. A cocktail table version was also released. The game was designed by Genyo Takeda and a young upstart designer named Shigeru Miyamoto. The Popeye characters were originally going to be used for Donkey Kong, but Nintendo decided to go with an original character creation that evolved into the iconic Mario. The CPU was a Z80 Chip running at 4MHz. Sound was produced using a AY8910 chip running at 2MHz. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Three Stages of Popeye[CR]THE DOCK STAGE - Popeye must catch 24 hearts that Olive Oyl tosses down one at a time. The HUD displays how many hearts the player has collected. If a heart reaches the bottom of the screen, the player will lose a life if he doesn't retrieve the breaking heart after about 10 seconds. [CR]Bluto chases Popeye throughout the stage. There are two ways he can be temporarily disposed of. One is by punching the signature can of spinach that will periodically appear on the sides of the screen. Once the can is punched, Popeye gets stong and turns red for about 10 seconds and has the ability to punch Bluto, sending him bouncing across the screen and into the sea. Catching hearts while in this 'red mode' will also net double points. The player will get 3000 points knocking out Bluto but he will shortly climb back out and continue his pursuit. The second way he can be incapacitated is by hitting a punching bag that dislodges a bucket. If timed right, the bucket will fall on Bluto's head giving the player 2000 points and some time to grabs some more hearts before he eventually pulls the bucket off. [CR]Both Bluto and the Sea Hag like to throw bottles at Popeye. These bottles can be broken by punching them. Bluto throws his bottles in groups of four and the Sea Hag will periodically show up on the side of the screen, throw one and disappear. Sometimes there will will be one on each side and they'll simultaneously throw a bottle, attempting to 'sandwich' Popeye between them is he isn't fast enough with his punches. Bluto can also jump up to a higher level or reach down to a lower level to knock Popeye out. Players should take caution when passing Bluto directly above or below him. [CR]THE STREET STAGE - This stage is similar to the first but features a different level layout and Olive throws musical notes instead of hearts. There is also a seesaw located in the lower left corner that, if timed right, allows Popeye to be launched in the air, thanks to Wimpy standing on the other end. Once in the air, Popeye can touch Sweet Pea for a point bonus who is floating above with a balloon. [CR]THE SHIP STAGE - The final stage features similar gameplay with two different features. One is there is a sliding platform at the top. Second each time Popeye catches one of the H-E-L-P letters that Olive tosses him, a ladder step will appear. Once enough letters are caught and the ladder is completed, Popeye can climb up and rescue Olive. The Sea Hag's pet vulture will also come out on the left side of the screen. Popeye can punch it continuously for points.[CR]Once Popeye rescues Olive, players are treated to a short intermission where Popeye's theme song is played while his face appears on the screen, blowing his signature "toot, toot" on his pipe. Players are then returned to the first stage again with increased difficulty. The Sea Hag now send bouncing skulls at Popeye, which are more difficult to punch. They will also fall down from an above level and knock him on the head if he is walking directly below. [CR]Ports[CR]Popeye was ported to several popular home consoles in subsequent years including the Atari 2600 and 5200, Intellivision, Colecovision, Odyssey2, and eventually came full circle releasing on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Ports to computer systems included the Texas Instruments TI-99, Atari XL, and Commodore 64. A mobile phone version was also released in 2008.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>This game aims to help younger Japanese speaking children learn some English vocabulary words. The game features Popeye the Sailorman, Bluto, Olive Oyl, and Swee'Pea, plus two locations from the game Popeye. The game modes included are Word Puzzle A,  Word Puzzle B, and Word Catcher.[CR]In Word Puzzle A, players first choose from one of six categories. The categories are animal, country, food, sports, science, and others. Olive Oyl will then select a word of random length from the selected category for Popeye to solve. Popeye solves the hidden word by punching letters, with the correct letters helping fill in the hidden word while incorrect guesses let Bluto knock into a suspended basket which holds Swee'Pea. If too many incorrect guesses are made Swee'Pea falls down and Popeye loses a round to Bluto. If Popeye fills in the word correctly before that happens, Popeye wins the round. Whoever (Popeye or Bluto) wins the most rounds out of ten wins Olive Oyl's love. There is also a question mark symbol, that when hit solves the puzzle automatically but also has the consequence of the player automatically losing that round.[CR]Word Puzzle B is basically played the same way as Word Puzzle A is, with the exception that in B, the Japanese translation of that word isn't displayed in Katakana like it is in A. So mode B is meant for those who have honed their English to a higher degree. [CR]Word Catcher is a game mode for two players. Popeye and Bluto are tasked with catching English alphabet letters which are being tossed down from Olive Oyl. They must catch the letters in the correct order, so that they will spell out a translation of one of three Japanese words that are displayed. Each correct word spelled wins the player a round. Whoever wins five rounds first wins Olive Oyl.</plot>

				<plot>Chaos ensues in the year 2191 as something goes wrong with the master computer that controls the entire planet. Player's take control of Steve Treiber who must destroy the master computer.[CR]Power Blazer is a side-scrolling platformer in which the player has to jump and fight their way through seven futuristic levels.

The range of the boomerang is limited by an energy bar which is fully depleted and then slowly recharged after the boomerang is thrown. The boomerang's range can be improved with power-ups. A more powerful boomerang that can be thrown through enemies can also be picked up. Other items include smart bombs and energy containers. They can be selected when the game is paused and used at any time. The first six levels can be played in any order. Once they are cleared, the final level is revealed. At the end of every level, a boss-fight awaits the player.

				<title_clean>Predator</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The home versions of the Predator videogame, based on the first feature film of the same name starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as Major Alan "Dutch" Schaefer, differed between platforms. For instance, whereas the NES version of Predator was a side-scrolling platforming action game where Dutch moved left and right, the Commodore 64 and other home computer versions featured an expanded movement plane which gave Dutch the ability to strafe up and down (a la P.O.W. or Double Dragon, et cetera) in addition to walking left and right.[CR]NES Version[CR]The NES version of Predator featured two different gameplay modes. When fighting through the regular jungle modes, the player will find themselves platforming and blasting various creatures in addition to confronting Predators. Once in a while, though, the game will enter a one-on-one Predator mode, which features much larger sprites. With very little actual level design (i.e. no platforming) to speak of, the one-on-one modes has the player shooting debris that comes their way in addition to shooting power-up orbs to upgrade their weapon. During these modes the player will also be engaged in a one-on-one confrontation with a single Predator.[CR]Predator for the NES also featured branching paths which took the player through different sets of levels, though it was still necessary to play the same number of levels to complete the game. Curiously, any time after the first big branch in the paths (level 5), choosing to continue after a Game Over would send the player back to level 5, making the continue system late in the game practically useless.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]At the splash screen before entering one of the big mode stages (it says Big Mode #, Player #), hold Down on an extra joystick connected to the Famicom's Expansion port, hold Up on controller 1 and rapidly press the A button also on controller 1. If done right, you should skip right to the next Small Mode stage. If you can somehow press both Down and Up on controller 1, the code would work too.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '87 is the second game in Namco's long running Family Stadium series, also known as Famista. It's a traditional baseball game that allows one human player against the CPU, two competing human players and two competing CPU players in a "Watch" spectator mode.[CR]Rather than being a full sequel to Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium the game is instead an updated version of the original, which was reflected in its lower price at release. It adds a few features and updates the official rosters for the athletes, but is functionally identical to the original Family Stadium. This specific type of annualization would become common practice for sports game franchises such as Madden NFL and NHL.[CR]It's worth noting that this game is unrelated to R.B.I. Baseball 2 from Tengen. The original R.B.I. Baseball and Family Stadium were one and the same, the former receiving a name change to appeal to a Western audience, but after that initial game both franchises diverged. R.B.I. Baseball specifically favored more realistic looking athlete sprites while Family Stadium would persist with the cartoonish "super deformed" sprites.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Cheats[CR]During gameplay, press Start to enter the main menu, then press Select to go into cheat entry mode.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '88 is the third in Namco's Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium series. As with its immediate predecessor, Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '87, it is a slightly revamped version of the original with updated rosters. As with EA Sports's present-day practice, Namco released these games annually with little to distinguish each new iteration. Most notable of the smattering of minor new additions is allowing the player to choose their venue from four options, ranging from a fully-packed stadium to a park.[CR]Though this is the second sequel to Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium, which was released in the US by Tengen as R.B.I. Baseball, Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium '88 is not to be confused with R.B.I. Baseball 3. Though the first R.B.I. Baseball was a direct localization, subsequent R.B.I. Baseball games were created in the US and are entirely independent from Namco's series.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Cheats[CR]During gameplay, press Start to enter the main menu, then press Select to go into cheat entry mode.

				<plot>No other baseball game gets you closer to playing in the big time than R.B.I. Baseball. Because every one of the ten teams in R.B.I. Baseball contains the rosters and player stats officially licensed from the MLB Players Association. Like real baseball, these skills and stats affect the outcome of every play. Like a real manager, you'll need to make good use of this vital information - and wise strategy decisions - if you want a winning record. R.B.I. Baseball is so intensely realistic, we've added amusing animation and a touch of humor to keep the action light-hearted and fun. You can play against the computer in a nine game season or compete against a friend in your own best-of-seven series. Stop playing with no-names and step up to the plate with real superstars in R.B.I. Baseball![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Alter Game RAM/ROM (Japan-only)[CR]Before using this cheat, it is highly recommended you understand how NES and video game programming work to some extent - this cheat allows you change any variable in the game's RAM ($0000 - $7FFF) and ROM ($8000 - $FFFF) in any manner you wish. Altering variables at random is very likely to just cause the game to crash unless you know what you are doing. Also note that this cheat requires the use of a Famicom controller that can press both Up and Down simultaneously (Player 1) and one that allows you press all four D-Pad buttons at the same time (Player 2).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Glitch Team[CR]In 1p mode, first, select the National All-Stars. Then select to play American league all stars. after the game with the American league, you will play the glitch team. Beware, this game will be an ass kicking. If your NES or emulator last through the game, you can play a better glitch team. Watch out for the 150 mile an hour pitches[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Programmers Screen[CR]At the title screen, hold A+B and press Start to view the names of the game's programmers.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bunt an Inside the Park Homerun[CR]This trick only works in 1P mode, against the computer. Use a left-handed batter and bunt. Try to get the ball to hit the right side of the bat (close to the batter). If you do this just right the ball will roll slowly past all the computer's outfielders (and infielders) and by the time they catch up to it, you'll be at home plate.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pro Yakyuu? Satsujin Jiken! ("Pro Baseball? Murder Case!") is a slightly tongue-in-cheek parody of the Famicom's overabundance of Portopia style murder mystery adventure games and baseball simulators, especially the annual Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium releases. The player controls a professional baseball player that's been framed for a murder and must solve the case while on the lam. Capcom inserted various additional modes into the game, such as mini-games and a shoot-em-up sequence whenever the protagonist is caught by the cops.[CR]This game is perhaps notable for being released on the same day in Japan - December 24th 1988 - as another Capcom game: Rockman 2. One of these sort of overshadowed the other.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Punch-Out!!</title_clean>
				<plot>Development:[CR]Genyo Takeda, who produced the Punch-Out!! arcade games, directed the NES versions. Because the NES was not as powerful as the arcade hardware, Takeda and his crew realized that it would be too difficult to make the NES port completely simulate the arcade versions. Instead of making the playable boxer wire-framed or transparent to see an opponent, they decided to shrink the playable boxer, so that players could easily see his opponents over his head. Though the arcade's playable boxer didn't have an official name, he was referred to as "Little Mac", because of his small stature. Other things added to the NES version that the arcade versions lacked were a rough plot, a background music track played during fights, animated cutscenes and a password system for saving progress.[CR]Around the time the Gold Version was released, Nintendo of America's founder and former president Minoru Arakawa attended a boxing match featuring Mike Tyson. While watching the boxer fight, Arakawa became so astonished with the athlete's "power and skill", he was inspired to use the athlete's name and likeness in the upcoming port of the Punch-Out!! series to help the game sell well.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]:[CR]Punch-Out!! features a boxer named Little Mac working his way up the professional boxing circuits, facing a series of colorful, fictional boxers, leading to a final fight with real-life boxer, the then-World Heavyweight Champion, which is Mike Tyson in the original version and Mr. Dream in the later version. The game requires good reflexes in reaction to the computer-controlled boxers' moves, as the more advanced boxers give very little indication of their coming moves. However, Punch-Out!! can be mastered by learning the computer-controlled boxers' consistent patterns.[CR]Little Mac has a limited repertoire compared to most of his opponents. His punches are limited to left and right jabs, left and right body blows, and a powerful uppercut. The uppercut can only be used once the player earns a star, which is typically accomplished by counter-punching the opponent directly before or after certain attacks are launched. For defensive techniques, Mac can dodge left or right, duck, and block attacks.[CR]Little Mac also has a heart meter, which decreases by three upon being struck by an opponent and one upon blocking an attack or an opponent blocking the player's attack. When the heart meter decreases to zero, Little Mac temporarily turns pink and appears exhausted, leaving the player unable to attack, but still able to defend. At this point, Mac can regain some hearts (and his normal color palette) only by avoiding the opponent's punches.[CR]A bout can end by knockout (KO), if a fighter is unable to get up within 10 seconds after being knocked down; by technical knockout (TKO), if a fighter is knocked down three times in one round; or by decision, if the bout lasts three full rounds without a clear winner. In order to win by decision, the player must accumulate a high enough point total by punching the opponent and/or knocking him down. However, some bouts cannot be won in this manner.[CR]When Little Mac loses his first bout, the opponent will offer a rematch. However if he loses a Title Bout, he will be ranked down (sometimes more than one place in the rankings.) On his second loss (if the loss was a rematch), he drops one place in the rankings (unless he is already at the bottom of his circuit) and must fight his way back up. A third loss (not necessarily a consecutive one) ends the game. The exception is the final fight against Mike Tyson/Mr. Dream; a loss to them automatically results in a game over.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The character models in Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! are each used twice, with the exception of King Hippo, just changing the head image, colors, and the unique special moves performed. The pairing is as follows:[CR]Glass Joe/Don Flamenco, Von Kaiser/Great Tiger, Piston Honda/Mike Tyson or Mr. Dream, King Hippo/(Unique), Bald Bull/Mr. Sandman, Soda Popinski/Super Macho Man.[CR]Other versions:[CR]Before the release of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! in North America, Nintendo released it in a gold-colored Famicom cartridge simply titled Punch-Out!! in Japan, without Mike Tyson in it, as a prize for the Golf U.S. Course Famicom Tournament.[4] This version's final boxer was Super Macho Man, who was also the final boxer of the Super Punch-Out!! arcade. When Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! sold well in North America, Nintendo later released the Mike Tyson version in Japan.[5][CR]Punch-Out!! featuring Mr. Dream:[CR]Towards the end of the NES's run, Nintendo's license to use Mike Tyson as a special Punch-Out!! character expired. Therefore, Nintendo replaced Tyson with a fictional character based on a then-Nintendo tournament champion, Mr. Dream. A popular myth is that Tyson was removed due to his divorce from actress Robin Givens[3], and his conviction for rape, which did not occur until a year after the changeover. It is also believed by some[who?] that because Tyson lost the Heavyweight Championship to James "Buster" Douglas by the contract expiration, Nintendo made no attempt to negotiate a new one with him.[citation needed] In August, 1990, the game was re-released simply as Punch-Out!! (or Punch-Out!! featuring Mr. Dream according to Nintendo Power) only in North America. This version has become the "official" incarnation of the NES Punch-Out!![CR]Other releases:[CR]Along with several NES titles by Nintendo, Punch-Out!! featuring Mr. Dream was later ported to several other platforms in Nintendo media. In Animal Crossing, it was one of the rarer unlockable NES games one could acquire within the game[citation needed]. It was also released through the Wii's Virtual Console service on March 30, 2007 to the European and Australian regions, April 3, 2007 in Japan, and in North America on April 16, 2007. During that release, reports have surfaced stating that when the game is played in progressive scan, the Virtual Console version of Punch-Out!! suffers from a lag in controls, which significantly raises the difficulty level compared to other versions of it.[6] Nintendo later rereleased the Game &amp; Watch game, Boxing, retitled as Punch-Out!! to promote Punch-Out!! featuring Mr. Dream's release. A remake of the game was released for the Wii in 2009.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]With its unique playability, graphics, and characters, Punch-Out!! has been well-received by many players and critics. It was rated the 17th best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Power's Top 200 Games list.[7] GameSpot has also placed it among the best games of all time. The title has been a source of satire[9] and nostalgic tribute[10] throughout the several years following its release.[CR]The video game incarnation of Mike Tyson was named the 25th most diabolical video game villain of all time by GamePro.[11][CR]Other appearances:[CR]Punch-Out!! was featured in the comic books of Valiant's Nintendo Comics System.Three stories are based around Little Mac, Doc Louis, and other boxers from the NES version, and Mac briefly appears in the comic that introduces the story of Captain N: The Game Master Mac doesn't appear in the Captain N stories himself; however, King Hippo is featured as a villain. Also, in the opening sequence of the Captain N TV series, the protagonist Kevin Keene was seen playing Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! before being forced into a vortex that formed in his television's screen.[CR]In Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Little Mac appears as a regular Trophy and an Assist Trophy. He sports a more textured look and performs punches and uppercuts.[12] In the same game, the music from the Manhattan skyline scene in Punch-Out!! can be heard in the song titled "Famicom Medley."[citation needed][CR]In the Wii game titled Captain Rainbow, Little Mac appears as a supporting character.[CR]In the Family Guy episode Not All Dogs Go to Heaven, when Peter is asked to say the grace, he prays for cheat codes to Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! because he has been stuck on Bald Bull for 4 years.[CR]In Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay, Kumar mentions that he can play Punch-Out!! on his iPhone while driving after leaving the bottomless mansion party.[CR]The game I Wanna Be the Guy uses Mike Tyson's rendering from this game as a boss.[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch-Out!!_(NES)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Beat Piston Honda with one punch[CR]In the second fight against Piston Honda it is possible to win the bout by scoring only one punch. Dodge his punches but don't retaliate. Then when he goes into his Piston Punch routine, hit him in the stomach like in the first fight. As in the first bout, if you time it right he'll be down. Unlike the first fight however, he will be too unsteady to keep his feet. I've even seen him be unable to get up. Just keep in mind that the charging time for his Piston Punch routine is a lot shorter so you really have to time it just right or you'll just end up taking major damage.</plot>

The FDS version would later be released on a Famicom cart in 1993. Puyo Puyo would be succeeded by a much more popular arcade game of the same name.[CR]Puyo Puyo contains three modes: Endless, Mission, and Verses. In Endless Mode, players match Puyo until the top of their well is filled. If the player chooses, either a giant 2x2 green Puyo or Carbucle will periodically help the player clear space on their board. Mission mode gives the player several challenges to complete, such as clearing a set amount of Puyo or clearing all Puyo of a certain color. Verses mode allows players to battle each other.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]Select "mission" at the game options start screen. Push start. The game will prompt you for a password.

				<plot>The challenge in each level of Puzznic is to maneuvre a selection of blocks into place so as to clear them all, by making them make contact with blocks of the same design. You control a cross-hair, which can move a block left or right, which can cause it to fall if there is no block under the space it would occupy.[CR]There are many complications in terms of solving the levels. Moving platforms meaning that you need to move a block at a particular time, or in particular order, to prevent them being blockaded. In some situations there are an odd number of a certain type of block - solving these requires positioning two of the blocks one space apart, such that a move will result in a piece making contact with 2 others, and immediately removing all 3. You will also encounter blocks positioned on platforms suspended in space and gaps in level arrangements meaning that a certain number of blocks must be in place to make a certain move possible (by forming a stack, for example)[CR]The game structure is slightly unusual, as after you complete each batch of four levels you get a choice of 2 sets of levels - you are progressing through an expanding matrix of levels, which means there are 2 sets on level 2, 3 on level 3, 4 on level 4, and so on. This means that there are a total of 220 screens in the game. Each screen is played against a time limit, and losing a level (either by running out of time, or by making a poor move and leaving an impossible position) loses one of your 3 lives.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Passwords[CR]Go to Password in the main menu and enter a password to go to the level in Puzznic Mode.</plot>

				<plot>Warning! QUARTH is the blockbuster puzzle challenge guaranteed to knock your socks and your block off at a maddening, mind-numbing pace. With a mortifying rain of bionic block patterns descending upon you, you race back and forth in your powerful Blockbuster ship obliterating the blocks before they blow you to kingdom come. Your incentive to stay alive is the points you rake in for every block you wipe out. And if you chalk up enough points to qualify, you'll charge into bonus games where it's you against the clock and the unstoppable blocks of QUARTH. So, ace, if you think you've got the steady hands of a brain surgeon, the sharp eye of an eagle, and the steely nerves of a Hollywood stuntman, power up QUARTH. And see if you can outlast the blockbusting action!</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Radia Senki: Reimeihan (literally "Chronicles of the Radia War: Dawn") is an action RPG developed by  Tecmo for the  Famicom. Only garnering an official release in Japan, Radia Senki puts players in the shoes of an amnesiac protagonist who can be named. While in search of his own memories, the protagonist soon encounters other characters such as Darth, a man out for revenge, and a mysterious princess and together they roam the game world in search of answers to various questions that plague their lives. As per the times in Tecmo's development antics, the game features cinematic cutscenes and musical stylings similar to that of their critically-acclaimed  Ninja Gaiden.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]  Radia Senki's command interface, which affects the behavior of other party members. [CR]Radia Senki features gameplay mechanics that are unconventional for its period, only being commonly adopted in strategy RPGs and other game types in later hardware generations. While there are fundamental RPG components in place such as equipment, shops, town exploration, and experience points, the actual combat takes place in real-time. The player only controls the protagonist directly, but can issue different strategic commands to other party members that, in turn, influence their AI as they fight. Furthermore, while fights do consist of random encounters, they take place on the same playing field as the game world itself, meaning that there are no transitions into battle-specific arenas like turn-based RPGs at the time such as  Final Fantasy. Experience points are also gained in real-time as each character defeats enemies. When battles have concluded, the player receives complimentary items before being whisked back to the point on the map where they were walking prior to the fighting.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]At the title screen, press and hold the B Button, then press the Start Button to access the Sound Test.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]This was the first video game designed by famed SimCity creator, Will Wright. Br&#248;derbund published it for the Commodore 64 in 1984. It was also later released for the MSX computer and the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. Each version of the game has a slightly different graphical style.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is displayed in a 2D overhead view of the terrain, which is populated by the enemy buildings &amp; vehicles of the Bungeling Empire. The player controls a helicopter that takes off from an aircraft carrier. This carrier slowly moves around the map on it's own, and performs several functions. It acts as a resupply point for more bombs, it restores health, and it is a respawn point if the player is shot down. The helicopter has two attacks; missiles (which are infinite) and bombs (which are very limited). The goal is to destroy the six factories that are scattered across the islands by using the bombs, while defending with the missiles. Over time, the factories grow and develop new weapons to use against the player, such as gun turrets, fighter jets, guided missiles, and eventually even a battleship. If any factory is left alone for too long, it will create enough new weapons to overwhelm the player, shooting him down and destroying his aircraft carrier. If a player is shot down, he still is given a limited ability to control the helicopter as it's going down, and if he can manage to crash into a factory, it will destroy it. In order to beat Raid on Bungeling Bay, the player must destroy all of the factories as quickly as possible, keeping them from growing &amp; advancing their technology. If the player succeeds, he is awarded a parade.[CR][B]Influence:[/B][CR]Will WrightThe game is an interesting precursor to the eventual creation of Will Wright's SimCity franchise. He continued to develop the editor for Raid on Bungeling Bay as his own personal toy, because he enjoyed creating different maps &amp; layouts. He figured if he was having fun with this, others might as well. So this map editing, combined with the dynamic feature of the growing factories in Bungeling Bay, was the main inspiration for his next game, the widely successful SimCity.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hidden Message[CR]At the title screen, wait until the demo begins.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rampart is a strategy/puzzle/action game in which the player alternately builds fortifications and then destroys invading enemy forces with the artillery within those fortifications. After which, the player then has to rebuild their damaged walls and add even more defensive means for the stronger enemy rounds to come. Created by Atari for the Arcades, the game would later see many home releases on a plethora of platforms.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls a handful of castles which must be defended and repaired all within a brisk time-limit. Ships will attack the fortress typically with cannon-fire, and the player must retaliate with their own arsenal, doing their best to protect the castle. They can build walls around their castles to absorb damage, but the player will ultimately need to get a bit creative to survive the increasingly tougher sieges.[CR]The player can place additional cannons within walls if they have been placed correctly. Ideally, the player is able to construct as many cannon enclosures as possible to maximize their offensive output and repel the enemy forces without incurring too much damage.[CR]In single-player, the player starts out by choosing where their fortress will be placed. They're then surrounded by a wall, and can then place their cannons. Following this are a set of rounds; the first being attack, the second repair. After surviving this barrage, the player is given additional time to place more cannons in their fort. The game ends when the player fails to successfully repair their castle, or when enough of the enemy fleet has been sunk.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Instant Win[CR]Pause the game, hold A + B + Select on Controller 1, then press Select on Controller 2 to enable an instant win for every match.</plot>

				<title_clean>Road Fighter</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR] The player controls a red car in a race divided into six stages. The goal is to reach the end of each stage without running out of fuel. If the car gets out of the road it will explode and additional fuel will be lost until you come back to the race. Bumping into traffic or opponents will not cause the player to instantly crash. You have the opportunity to counter-steer and allow the car to continue to race without fuel loss. The car has two gears; one low gear that tops at 192 kmph, and one high gear that tops at 400 kmph. [CR] Along the race there will be bonus cars. Those will grant bonus points and additional fuel. [CR] There are other ways to be granted bonus points. Racing for a while without bumping into other cars gives you bonus points (a train or an airplane or a super-hero will appear in the screen) and completing a stage without bumping into any car gives you 10000 bonus points. [CR] Road Fighter was later ported to the MSX and the NES. It would also get two sequels, Midnight Run: Road Fighter 2 and Winding Heat. It was also released on the Xbox 360 as one of the launch titles for  Game Room on March 24th 2010.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Make Konami Man appear[CR]If you can race along any course for about 3/4 the length of the track without crashing, Konami Man will fly up the left side of the screen and give you 1000 points.[CR]Note: This trick was performed on the European Palcom version of the game.  I do not know if it works for the Famicom version.</plot>

				<title_clean>RoboCop</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]RoboCop is a licensed sci-fi side-scrolling shooter based on the 1987 movie about the titular cop cyborg. It loosely follows the events of the movie, pitting RoboCop against gun-toting criminals and the ED-209 bipedal robot.[CR]The original Arcade game was developed by Data East (though some sources also say Nihon Bussan) in 1988 and ported to numerous home computers in the US and Europe. Most of the European releases were handled by Ocean Software. Japanese developer SAS Sakata developed the 1989 NES port. The Commodore 64 and Game Boy versions of the game are subtly different from the rest, featuring a different plot unrelated to the movie, but still contains similar gameplay. Music from the Game Boy game, composed by Jonathon Dunn and based on the C64 soundtrack, was used in an European TV advert for the kitchen appliance company Ariston.[CR]Data East and Ocean Software would go on to produce sequels that looked and played similarly, based on the movies RoboCop 2 and RoboCop 3 and the 1992 Dark Horse comic book series RoboCop Versus The Terminator.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>RoboCop 2 is a mission-based platform game. Missions have various objectives, such as destroying nukes or killing all the enemies. If you didn't destroy/kill enough, you'll be transported to a training mission, which is a first-person perspective shoot 'em up. Should you also fail the training, you must go to the beginning of the previous mission. Successfully completed mission or enough points scored by training allow you to proceed to the next stage. Unlike in the first RoboCop, there's no time limit, and you are able to jump.</plot>

				<title_clean>Robocco Wars</title_clean>
				<plot>Robocco Wars ("Robo Child Wars") is a Japan-only Family Computer game that lets the player control a shape-changing robot named R-10 (and his human controller Lance) as they fights evil robots. On the land, the player is a freight train that must follow the railroad tracks to the boss of the level. However, the robot turns into an airplane when the player is forced to fly to the next mission. Sea missions require the player to transform into a submarine.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]Play through 10 stages as a robot that can transform, jump and shoot enemies as a robot, spaceship, and submarine.[CR]The player has three (3) lives and three (3) continues as he struggles to liberate the world of Robocco from evil.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]This is a complete translation patch for Robocco Wars for the NES. It translates the title screen courtesy of FlashPV, a japanese graphic which I designed and fixes up some engrish. There also appears to be two hidden/unused stages. I would like to see if they exist, but I'm not going to pursue the possibility. Although a level select cheat might do the trick.[CR]What's Left:[CR]Also one small graphic found in the ROM and haven't been able to find it in the game. It means Sayo-chan with a heart. Let me know if you find it.[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/1388/[CR]</plot>

				<plot>It's MEGA MAN versus the powerful leaders and fighting forces of Monsteropolis - that strange multi-layered land of robot-like humanoids created by the wrongly-performed experiments with human beings by Dr. Wily. Mega Man - the chosen defender of the human race. For he dares to single-handedly penetrate Monsteropolis' seven separate societies to stop the rapid expansion of strange misrepresentations of humans. Mega Man's goal is monumental. He must infiltrate seven separate heavily-guarded empires. By himself, he must break down and destroy the following empire leaders: Cutman, Gutsman, Iceman, Bombman, Fireman, Elecman, and Dr. Wily. The action involves Mega Man armed only with laser beam weapons, encountering strangely-configured humanoids. They're atop, in and out of fortified prison-like structures strengthened with thick walls. Hidden amid gun turrets embedded in concrete uprights, even in subterranean passages below icefields. WOW![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Iceman stage glitch[CR]There is a point in the Iceman stage where you try to get a 1-up but often miss it.  When you drop down to the next screen (the one before the Big Eye), use your magnet beam and try to climb your way up and try to hop onto the offscreen platform where the 1-up is supposed to be. The moment you step on it, the screen will glitch and show you falling to the screen below and avoiding the Big Eye in the process. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] The Select Trick[CR]When using a weapon that goes through an enemy, press the Select button (this pauses the game with out bringing up the weapon menu) when the weapon is making contact with the enemy. While the game is paused this way the enemy will continue to flash. When the flashing has stopped, press the Select button again to un-pause the game and the weapon will 'hit' the enemy again causing more damage.  [CR]You can do this trick repeatidly with many of the bosses making them very easy to beat.</plot>

				<plot>He's Back! And this time the evil Dr. Wily (once the supreme power in the universe) has created even more sinister robots to mount his attack. But as MegaMan, you've also grown in power and ability. Can you save mankind from the evil desires of Dr. Wily? Each of the eight empires is ruled by a different super-robot. You must defeat each enemy on his own turf, building up weapons as you go. Only after all are destroyed will you go head-on with the mastermind himself, the evil Dr. Wily.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Airman-Wily stage 2 warp glitch[CR]During the boss fight with Airman, use Item 1 so that the platform is created on the far left side.  Jump on the platform, and you'll notice that it already becomes glitchy by not moving the Air attacks created by Airman.  If you're in the correct position on the platform, as you go past the enterance to this room, it will act as though you just entered a door, and push you through the right hand side of the room.  For some reason, this ends up being Stage 2 of Dr Wily's fortress, except that now all backgrounds/platforms are made up out of the backgrounds/platform textures of Airman's stage.  IE they will be made up from clouds/skies.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Turn Stars Into Birds[CR]At the Stage Select Screen, hold down the A + B buttons and choose a boss. When the next screen comes up that displays the boss and his name, the stars in the background will turn into birds.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Avoid getting hurt.[CR]If you repeatedly pause the game, enemy shots will pass directly through Megaman.</plot>

				<plot>It's robot rebellion, and nobody's safe! Least of all, Mega Man! This time the superpowerful cyborg takes on a horde of metal maniacs who've had it with being obedient! And they use every android-annihilator ever invented to make you believe it! Mega Man goes berserk, blasting through a galaxy of mining stations in search of energy crystals. But it takes more than guts to battle the phenomenal robot masters who control these worlds. It's a wrenching job, the worst - and the best - that Mega Man's faced so far![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Get Rush Jet Early[CR]Normally, to obtain the Rush Jet, you must get it by defeating Needle Man. Instead you can go to Shadow Man's stage and defeat him so that you acquire the Shadow Blade from him. Then, go to any other level and find a weapon energy refill capsule. Don't pick it up yet. Instead, open up the pause menu and highlight the Shadow Blades. Then press Right on the D-Pad, then press start to unpause the game and you should now have an empty weapon energy meter. Grab the weapon energy capsule and you will now fill up the empty energy meter. This energy meter is the Rush Jet.  You can now summon the Rush Jet anytime. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Freeze Enemies - US Version Only[CR]On Controller 2, hold Up and A and most enemies will be frozen, making them easy to hit. Some enemies - for example, bosses - will not be affected.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rollerball is a pinball game from HAL Laboratory themed around New York City that was released in both Japan and the US. There are four tables feature which link vertically to one another - should the player find a way to the next table (or allow the ball to pass their flippers) the game shifts its focus to a different section. The goal of the game, as it is with all pinball games, is to acquire the highest score possible with a limited number of balls. There is also a two player mode in which two human players compete on the same table for the highest score.[CR]Though best known for its NES incarnation, Rollerball originally came out on the MSX in 1984. It was one of the first computer games Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata ever worked on. The NES version is a graphically remastered version of this original.[CR]Rollerball has zero relation to the 1975 movie of the same name about a futuristic death sport.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Rolling Thunder</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rolling Thunder is an action game developed by Namco and released in Japanese arcades in 1986. In it, you play as a member of the WCPO (World Central Police Organization/&#19990;&#30028;&#21009;&#20107;&#35686;&#23519;&#27231;&#27083;) named Albatross who is trying to rescue his partner, Leila, from the evil organization bent on world domination called "GELDRA". There are a couple of minor differences between the arcade and Famicom versions of the game; these mostly revolve around the types of maskers encountered, the number of them encountered (the arcade version has a vastly greater number of enemies attacking Albatross) and the speed of their bullets (their bullets travel much faster in the famicom version, making reacting trickier at times!). The game features 10 stages.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player must help Albatross make his way through various GELDRA bases in search of clues to the location of their HQ and to rescue Leila. To do so, the player guiding him will need quick reflexes. Albatross is armed with a pistol which can be shot rapidly; if the player should run out of ammo, the last bullet will regenerate over time, but this seriously impedes the player's rate of fire. Albatross is capable of touching an enemy twice before dying, or being shot/hit by a grenade/burned with flames/etc. a single time before losing a life.[CR]In many stages there are two or more "levels" (a ground floor and a catwalk of some sort) that the player can stand on; the player can switch between them by either hitting up and jump or down and jump. Sometimes there are objects (or not, as the issue is generally a lack of a hand rail) which will prevent the player from dropping down from the upper level. In addition, doors are spaced throughout all stages. These doors serve three purposes: Firstly, they are a point of entry for GELDRA agents, termed "maskers". Secondly, they are a place for Albatross to hide from the maskers. Be careful though, as if a masker sees you enter, he won't be afraid to simply stand in front of the door! Thirdly some doors are labeled "ammo" or "arms". The "arms" doors temporarily grant Albatross the ability to use a machine gun. When the ammo runs out, Albatross returns to using his normal pistol. The "ammo" doors simply contain extra ammo for Albatross' pistol. At the end of each stage, the player is treated to a cutscene of maskers watching other maskers harassing Leila via a massive monitor, either stripping her of clothing, electrocuting her, or performing some other diabolical and villainous deed.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Albatross[CR]The main protagonist. He belongs to "Rolling Thunder", a group of the best agents in the WCPO. His favourite gun is a "Walther P-38". His design is apparently loosely inspired by Lupin III. He returns in Rolling Thunder 2.Leila[CR]A fellow member of Rolling Thunder and Albatross' partner, she was caught while on duty by GELDRA. The object of the game is to rescue her. She returns as a playable character in Rolling Thunder 2.Maboo[CR]The evil leader and founder of the GELDRA organization. He is determined to conquer the world, and doesn't even appear to be human. He is capable of firing energy projectiles from his hands.The maskers[CR]The foot soldiers of the GELDRA organization. They come in a great variety of colors, which generally are an indicator of how they attack and react to the player. Some, termed "ninjas", are equipped with special stealth suits; others which wear goggles and have rounded hoods are generally sturdier than your basic masker.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]There are several stage types in Rolling Thunder; the player passes through two sets of stages termed "story 1" and "story 2", culminating in the second secret lab which is GELDRA's true headquarters.Warehouse[CR]The first stage in both story 1 and 2 are of this variety. It is characterized by a blue background and containers.Underground passageway[CR]Resembling a cave, there are often panthers or mutant bats called gelzo found in these.GELDRA base[CR]Secret GELDRA bases hidden around the world. These resemble labs, and are generally swarming with maskers.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 5 Continues[CR]At the main menu, press and hold Up &amp; A on the 2nd controller, then hold Up &amp; B on the 1st controller and then press Start. If done right, you'll have 5 continues instead of 3.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]SD Gundam World: Gachapon Senshi 2 - Capsule Senki is the second of five SD Gundam World games for the Famicom, published by Bandai using the Gundam license from Sunrise Studios. As with its predecessor, Scramble Wars, the game is a tactical turn-based war simulation in which each side uses their Gundam mechas to defeat the other and are occasionally aided by a "gachapon" - or capsule machine - that dispenses additional Gundams in a manner similar to their toy counterparts.[CR]The game was the first of the series to be released on a Famicom cart, as Scramble Wars was a Famicom Disk System-only game. Capsule Senki was also rereleased on the Japanese Wii Shop's Virtual Console.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]SWAT: Special Weapons and Tactics is based on an obscure manga by cartoonist Oki Hajime that focuses on five police officers working in a SWAT team and plays like a tactical turn-based RPG such as Dragon Quest, though far more involved and slower paced. In combat each member of the four person team chooses a target and one of their weapons to attack them with and the game plays out the battle turn by turn. The terrorists the player encounters in the otherwise nondescript office building the game takes place in can be wounded and interrogated for more information, or simply killed.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Saint Seiya - Ougon Densetsu</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bandai produced this Saint Seiya RPG to cash in on a recent movie adaptation of the TV anime and manga. The manga concerns five brave souls, called "Saints", who fight for the Greek goddess Athena against the other gods of the Greek pantheon. In order to do so, they each wear sacred armor that contain signs of the zodiac. The show was popular in its native Japan and in a few other countries such as France, but would not see an English translation for some time.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]To tie-in with the astrological theme, the game will ask for the player's date of birth. Depending on which sign they have, they will be assigned a different initial stat layout. It's a concept that would later be seen in Final Fantasy Tactics.[CR]Regular gameplay plays out like a brawler: Seiya walks along and fights enemies with his punch attacks; defeating the enemy grants Seiya some amount of experience points. When faced with an important story character or boss, the game switches to a turn-based RPG mode where the player must strategically plan out their course of attack, as well as maintain their defenses. Seiyu and his opponent take turns trading blows until one of them falls.[CR]Experience points, unlike in most JRPGs, must be spent in various attributes to have any effect, with larger stats needing more experience points to increase further. This is opposed to the usual system of simply hitting a pre-determined total to level up, increasing all the character's stats instantaneously.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 999 EX (Japanese Version)[CR]While playing, press Select to enter the menu. Enter the second option (Ability). Place the cursor on "End" and press Up-Right. If done right, the cursor will place itself outside of the menu border. Now press the B button to increase your EX points to 999.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] All Stats, Cosmos, Points and Exp. at Max Level (French Version)[CR]At the title screen, select 'Suite' and enter the following password</plot>

				<title_clean>Sakigake!! Otoko Juku - Shippuu Ichi Gou Sei</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sakigake!! Otokojuku: Shippu Ichi Gou Sei is the first video game adaptation of the manga Sakigake!! Otokojuku, about a private school that teaches troubled teens ouendan - a form of male cheerleading that involves percussion instruments and chanting, best known to western gamers as the core mechanic of the Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan/Elite Beat Agents games. Both the manga and the anime series - which came out close to this game's release and is assuredly its main inspiration and reason for its existence - is extremely violent as well, and the game's nature as a brawler emphasizes this aspect.[CR]The player can select between four main characters, however they all look and play identically. Most of the game is a 2D side-scroller, though the game will switch to a depth-enhanced field - such as that seen in Double Dragon or Final Fight - for its boss battles.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>You've saved the innocent people of Gradius from the vile Bacterions. But now an even deadlier plague has slimed into the neighborhood. It's Zelos, an all-engulfing, planet-eating alien who's hungering to take a bite out of you! Only this time you don't have to rescue the millions of Gradians alone. You can call on a starfighter friend from the planet Latis, who'll fight beside you in his RoadBritish space destroyer. You'll both be gunning for max power-ups, with ripple lasers, plutonic missiles and impregnable force fields. But you better be on target. For this isn't your ordinary space scum. And to crush him you've gotta soar through his guts, blast past his death traps and ultimately blow out his heart. Good luck, Commander. The galaxy's counting on you![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 255 lives[CR]This glitch might be a bit difficult to pull off, but rest assured that it works. Start a 2 players game. Bring the first player's lives to 0 and the second player's lives to 1. Now position your ships right on top of each other. They have to basically look like 1 ship. Now let yourself be killed and rapidly press the A button on controller 1 to try to steal a life from the 2nd player. If done right, both players will come back to life and the second player will have 255 lives to spare.</plot>

There, they seem to sell only five items: a Pennant, a Jelly, a Key Chain, a Wooden Sword, and a Bear Figurine. However, between the first two items (Pennant and Jelly) is a line, which has been left blank for some inconceivable reason. If you scroll to it and try to buy the "blank" item there, you will not have a blank item added to your inventory, but rather you will end up having purchased 12 Jelly items for 5,000 Rupees - the significance of this being that 12 Jellies, at 500 Rupees each (as they are listed in that shop), cost 6,000 Rupees, saving you 1,000 Rupees!</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sanada Juu Yuushi (roughly "Sanada Ten Braves") is a Sengoku era themed RPG featuring ninjas. The Sanada in question is Yukimura Sanada, the second son of one of the more important daimyos (feudal lords) of that era, who is purported to have had ten legendary ninjas helping his war efforts - the same ten braves referred to by the game's title.[CR]The game's general plot has Sanada finding and recruiting the titular ten braves, usually with the caveat that the player helps them with a task before they'll agree to join the party. The menu-driven RPG battles are a little unusual as each is a one-on-one battle with a singular opponent - however, the player is free to choose from any of the characters they've already recruited, changing the character in the subsequent round if they so wish.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sangokushi refers to a novel written about the Three Kingdoms period of China, where the country was temporarily split into three warring states. This is different to the the Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel, a mostly fictionalized account written some considerable time after the conflict was over and has had many video game adaptations, not least of which being Koei's Romance of the Three Kingdoms and their later Dynasty Warriors series.[CR]As a war strategy game, the goal for the player and their chosen side is to reclaim all of China under their rule. Players can gather intel, invade other territories or increase their own stats and purchase weapons and supplies for their armies. The game affords the player a certain number of actions per turn before letting the CPU opponents have their turns.[CR]Though this game was created after Romance of the Three Kingdoms, it is in fact the first NES game to be based on the conflict.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Romance of the Three Kingdoms (JP: Sangokushi) is a strategy game based on the Chinese novel of the same name. The player assumes the role of one of the Chinese generals involved in the conflict, attempting to recover land from their two rival kingdoms and unite China under their kingdom's rule. [CR]The game was originally released in December 1985 for the NEC PC-88 platform. Koei would go on to port the game to many other systems, as well as create many sequels with iterative improvements.[CR]Super Sangokushi is a revamped version of the original Sangokushi for the Super Famicom that was released in 1994. It was not the first Romance of the Three Kingdoms game for the system: it followed the 1991 Sangokushi II SFC release and 1992 Sangokushi III SFC release.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The player controls a facsimile of Sanma in a detective outfit as he tracks down clues behind a grisly murder that is depicted in the opening cutscene. In spite of the macabre death that begins the game it is full of Japanese comedic touches, such as absurd non-sequitur mini-games and an instance of perverted humor where the protagonist can search a girl's bedroom and find undergarments.[CR]It is also full of unique additions to the genre, presumably suggested by Sanma Akashiya himself in much the same way Beat Takeshi directed some of Takeshi's Challenge's odder design decisions. These include a little crab as a cursor for selecting items to interact with as well as the strange designs for some of the NPCs.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Sanrio Carnival is just a hodge-podge of various puzzle games, such as "falling candy of doom," and "rearrange the picture" (better known to some as "Columns," and "Major Annoyance"). But, it throws in all those loveable Sanrio characters, which makes up for it being a mediocre game. Playing against the computer is entirely boring. However, finding another human player may inject some added fun. But then again, finding another person to play Nitendo is a game unto itself :-P[CR]Translation Description:[CR]The translation is complete!

				<title_clean>Sanrio Cup - Pon Pon Volley</title_clean>
				<plot>This is a great game. As the name implies, it's a volley ball game with Sanrio characters. Which instantly makes it fun. You basically hit the volley ball back and forth until someone misses it or hits it out of bounds. Simple? Yes! But still very fun. You also may have heard a rumor that that Kunio Volley Ball game kicks this game's ass in. Well, that rumor is just wrong. Sorry Kunio. Well-played, but you just FELL SHORT. This is the real thing folks. Because it's Sanrio. PLay it! It is commanded of you![CR]Translation Description:[CR]In playtesting, I thought I found a couple of untranslated commentator things, but maybe I just dreamed it one night. And if I say so myself, the signs totally suck. Apart from that, it's a great game and it's in English. Go play the game now.[CR]Reviewer: wraith[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/210/[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Satomi Hakkenden (usually translated as "The Eight Dog Chronicles") was a long-running 19th century novel series about eight samurais from the Sengoku period and their various adventures. It was in some ways partly inspired by the ancient Chinese epic The Water Margin, which has itself seen video game adaptations in the form of the Suikoden games. Receiving numerous TV and film adaptations, including the 1983 film known in the west as Legend of the Eight Samurai, Satomi Hakkenden would be its first video game adaptation. Makai Hakkenden Shada for the Turbografx-16, also released in 1989, would be a later adaptation.[CR]The game itself plays much like Dragon Quest; a common source of inspiration for 8-bit RPGs. The player can walk around towns conversing with NPCs, equipping themselves with weapons and armor and receiving quests and directions to new areas before leaving the safety of the town to fight random encounters on the overworld map that links locations together. Combat follows the tactical turn-based pattern, allowing the player input their characters' desired actions before watching each turn play out. Most of the enemies in the game are based on classical Japanese monsters, usually youkai.[CR]</plot>

The President of the game company only gives the protagonist three days to solve the case before they get the police involved, giving the player a strict deadline. The game's writer will introduce himself just before the player is asked to identify the culprit, and provide the game's final opportunity to save. The game also has multiple endings, depending on what the player does after the murderer has been identified.[CR]</plot>

The character has a health timer that is constantly ticking down, and drops further if the character collides with enemies, but can be replenished with potions. There are also shops the player can visit which provides players with helpful items including the most expensive available: guitars. Purchasing guitars for each member of the band will end the game.[CR]Like many games that attempted cash-in on a then-popular license, the game is of overall poor quality.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue after Game Over[CR]When you get the Game Over screen, hold down the A and B buttons on Controller 2 and press START on Controller 1 to continue in the area where you died.

				<plot>The boy Michimune and the girl Miu happily live in a small house together with their wise old grandfather. One day, just when they were about to celebrate Miu's birthday, the room suddenly became dark, and an evil demonic figure appeared out of nowhere. Ironically, the dark being addressed your grandfather, saying it's been a long time. Apparently, grandfather also knew who or what this figure was, since he called him by the name Rosenkreuz. Rosenkreuz explains that he has waited a hundred years, but now it is possible to bring back the God of Evil, and to control the world! But for an unknown reason, he needs Miu. Rosenkreuz strikes your grandfather, and kidnaps Miu! Before grandfather dies, he could only whisper: "Save... Miu...". And thus, Michimune embarks on a dangerous journey to the land of evil, to save Miu from the clutches of Rosenkreuz.[CR]"Seirei Gari" is a horror-themed adventure game along the lines of the more known  Uninvited or  Deja Vu. Every action is performed by choosing a command from the menu. You should examine every location before objects become "visible" and possible to interact with. Sometimes you'll also have companions at your side who will help you on your quest.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sekiryuou (often translated as "Red Dragon King") is a traditional Famicom adventure game from Sunsoft, in which the player controls a protagonist via a series of menus in order to solve a series of puzzles. Though Sunsoft is credited as publisher, it is unclear if the game was made in-house or contracted to another developer.[CR]The game, and the manga it is based on, depict a period of ancient Chinese history between the Qin and Han dynasties, a few decades before the Three Kingdoms era began. As expected of a transitional period, there was plenty of intrigue and conflict leading up to the change of power that future novels and mangas could draw from.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Shadowgate</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The entrance to Castle Shadowgate in the NES version.[CR]Shadowgate is a 1987 point-and-click adventure game originally released for the Mac by ICOM Simulations and is part of the MacVenture series. It has been ported to a variety of platforms including the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1989. The player takes control of a relatively faceless character who must traverse through the castle avoiding many obstacles and choosing the right course of action to proceed. The game is extremely linear and usually there is only one correct solution to every puzzle with all other solutions leading to the player's demise or an equally dire consequence. The player is required to carry a flaming torch at all times to illuminate the path ahead. If the torch dies, the player must light another as soon as possible or an unfortunate end will be met. The torches also act as a time-limiter, with only a certain number of torches in the game the player must reach the conclusion before all the torches have expired.[CR]A lot of items in the game can be used in many ways, for example, it is possible to go through the item menu screen and tell the game to use the flaming torch on the player, where upon the game will inform the player that they have received a nasty burn, and eventually burn themselves to death if repeated. The player could even thrust an arrow into his chest and commit suicide in that manner.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The player is a faceless character who is only described in the game as the "last of a great line of hero-kings". He must attempt to stop the Warlock Lord from releasing the Behemoth from Hell.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]One of the many death messages in the game.[CR]The game is a "point-and-click" adventure title that revolves around the player looking at a usually static background and scanning it for clues, possible threats and the path ahead. The player can interact with many items of interest in a lot of scenes, attempting different things, and the game relaying the outcome through its frank and often hilarious text window. The player can pick up a good deal of items on their travels, many of which will be imperative if they are to succeed in their goals. The game features many memorable foes, such as the Wraith the player encounters early in the game and the fire-breathing Dragon later down the line.[CR]Death is a very, very common thing in Shadowgate. If the player died at a point they can retrace their steps and attempt to solve the puzzle differently, and if they succeed they can proceed, but would only progress so far before being smote again and retracing their steps once more. The game is as much about thinking intelligently about solutions as it is just running in and trying everything one at a time until the correct method is used. There are a few instances where there are multiple solutions to a given problem, but these are few and far between.[CR]Shadowgate has many items that are used to solve puzzles in the game. Some of the items that appear to be normal are used in ways most people would never think of. Such as the war hammer that the player can't actually use to attack any enemies but is used to open secret portals. Some items, like the helmet or human bone, can be picked up but have no use whatsoever in the game except to clutter the inventory. Most items only have one use and are never used again. There are only a few items that can be used more than once, but even then the most they are used is twice. There are around 40 items in the game that all need to be used to solve a specific puzzle. Usually there is no hints when to use an item, which leads to a lot of guessing and trial and error to discover when each item needs to be used.[CR]Remake[CR]Initially intended to be a 25th anniversary celebration, a remake was confirmed to be in production for PC, Mac, iOS, and Android for release in 2013. Footage, art direction, and remixed music have been shown off at the game's Kickstarter. Some puzzles are new or reworked, and all of the components, including graphics and script, are being completely overhauled. The game's music is based on the much-acclaimed NES version's soundtrack. Zojoi, the company behind this new version, is made up of designers that worked on the original MacVentures version.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Broom trick[CR]Later in the game, a Sphinx usually asks you to answer a riddle with an item.If you use the broom on him before he speaks to you, he will let you pass without having to gather any other item in the game.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shanghai is a board game where the goal is to remove tiles from the board by selecting pairs of currently "free" tiles, defined as any tile with a side free (other than the front) that can be removed from the table without disturbing its neighboring tiles. If the player is able to remove every tile on the board without getting stymied by locked tiles, they win the game. Though circles, bamboos, characters and dragons must be removed in identical pairs, a flower can be paired off with any other flower and the same is also the case for seasons. This is because there is only one flower/season tile each.[CR]Shanghai is frequently mistaken for the game of Mahjong, which is considerably more in-depth and plays more like the card game Rummy. Since Shanghai uses the same tileset as Mahjong and it is a one-player game, it is often called Mahjong Solitaire.[CR]This particular version was created in the late-80s and ported to various systems courtesy of Activision. Sunsoft is credited as responsible for the Famicom version, which was only available in Japan.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] View Credits[CR]At the title screen, press Up + Left + B + Select to jump to the credits.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sherlock Holmes: Hakushaku Reijou Yuukai Jiken ("Sherlock Holmes: The Kidnapping of the Count's Daughter") is an adventure game with action elements starring Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's famous detective Sherlock Holmes. It is the first of three such Famicom games from obscure Japanese publisher Towa Chiki, the next two being Meitantei Holmes: Kiri no London Satsujin Jiken and Meitantei Holmes: M-Kara no Chousenjou.[CR]Unlike its sequels, which are more traditional Famicom text adventures, Hakushaku Reijou Yuukai Jiken is primarily an action game: Sherlock travels to various cities across the United Kingdom searching for clues behind the kidnapping of the eponymous Count's daughter. In each location, Sherlock can walk around the city and investigate suspicious locations, such as sewers and buildings. Defeating the various henchmen (or regular citizenry) roaming around the cities and sub-locations will provide Sherlock with the funds necessary to move onto the next city via the railway stations. The ultimate goal is to pinpoint where the culprit is hiding with enough clues and confront them.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue - Maximum Health[CR]At the Game Over screen, press Right + A + B on Controller 2. You'll be returned to the game with full HP and half of your money. Additionally if you hold Left + A + B on Controller 1 before press the buttons on the Controller 2, your money won't be decreased.</plot>

				<plot>This is an infuriating puzzle game. It wastes no time in holding your hand through the first few, you know, letting you understand the game's intricacies. Therefore, all of these screenshots are from the game's first level, cause I really don't want to bother with it. The manual included in the zip doesn't help either. Well anyways, all the screenshots look different because you have three different "themes" that you can use. I like the ninja cause he crawls around and he's funny. Hahaha! That's all.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]Seeing as how no one has ever beaten this game, like, ever, we can only assume that the game is completely translated.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu (New Burning!! Pro Baseball) is the sixth of Jaleco/TOSE's Moero!! series of sports games (it's occasionally referred to as Moero 6!! Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu) and the third in the series to be associated with baseball. The first two Moero!! Pro Yakyuu games saw localizations in the US as Bases Loaded and Bases Loaded 2, but Shin Moero!! Pro Yakyuu was skipped. What eventually became Bases Loaded 3 was instead the fourth Moero!! Pro Yakyuu game, Moero 8!! Pro Yakyuu '90 Kandouhen.[CR]The biggest difference between the previous Moero!! Pro Yakyuu/Bases Loaded games and this one is the slanted perspective for batting and pitching. Instead of the camera being behind the batter or pitcher, the player can see both from an angle, with the two situated diagonally from each other. Likewise, the baseball diamond is shown at an angle making it appear more like a square, with the rest of the field stretching outwards. Despite this new perspective, the game controls similarly to previous Bases Loaded games.[CR]A curious addition is that of the biorhythms, which tells the player how each athlete is feeling: If the athlete is having an off-game, one or more of these biorhythms will be low and the player will need to strategize around these dips. Though big in 70s sports punditry, the idea of mathematical biorhythms predicting an athlete's prowess in any upcoming game was all but discredited as pseudoscience by the time when this game came out.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] CHR Test[CR]Press A and B, then reset the console.</plot>

It was developed by Virgin Interactive for many home systems, such as the Commodore 64.[CR]In 1988 the game was reworked by Japanese company Hect to more closely resemble a Zelda-like top-down view (opposed to the original's side-scrolling perspective) and was drastically changed graphically.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shoukoushi Ceddie (sometimes Cedie) is the Japanese title of the 1886 Frances Hodgson Burnett novel Little Lord Fauntleroy, about a down-to-earth kid from New York discovering his heritage as the heir to an Earldom in England, moving to his inherited estate and learning how to become a nobleman. Fuji Television created a 43 episode anime series based on the novel in 1988, and this video game adaptation is based on that TV show. Fuji Television is perhaps best known in western video game circles for being responsible for Doki Doki Panic (the game the American/European Super Mario Bros 2 is based on) as well as airing GameCenter CX (or Retro Game Master).[CR]The game plays much like a regular Famicom adventure game: The player walks around, talks to people and finds items which are used to solve puzzles. However, rather than selecting destinations from a menu, the player manually walks around the different locales using a top-down perspective. There are also action sequences where the player must avoid random pedestrians when leaving the estate. If he collides with an NPC, or goes into the wrong door, he is chided by his tutor and forced to answer trivia questions.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]Hold A, B, Select &amp; Start and Reset the game. The game will restart as a black screen. Press Up or Down and A or B to hear the music.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shufflepuck Caf&#233; is a 1988 game that was originally released for the early model Apple Macintosh by Br&#248;derbund Software. It was later adapted to many other home computers. This air hockey game can be played in sessions against one opponent at a time, which the player chooses from a splash screen that features every character, or in a tournament mode where the player takes on every opponent in order of difficulty on their way to the top.[CR]The player must rebound the puck past the opponents paddle, effectively breaking the holographic "glass" at the end of the table. The winner is the first to score fifteen points.[CR]The original releases was black and white, while later versions featured color.[CR]The player faces nine distinct opponents, each with their own strategies and tricks to get past them:DC3: A waiter robot and an opponent with customizable difficulty levels that the player can practice on. Does not appear in the tournament mode.Skip Feeney: A nerdy human who is also new to the game. First opponent in tournament mode.Visine Orb: A small, nervous creature that quickly moves its paddle around but doesn't do much to block the player's shots.Vinnie The Dweeb: An easy-going and languid player that is slow to react. Looks like a giant humanoid sloth.Lexan Smythe-Worthington: An aristocratic alien who is always seen with a drink in his hand. Starts strong but constantly sips his martini throughout the match, making him less and less effective.Eneg Doowtrop: Also known as The General, this military pig alien is aggressive with his returns but can leave gaps in his defense.Nerual Ttoille: A mysterious alien that copies the player's every move, making him hard to overcome.Princess Bejin: A mysterious robed woman who occasionally cheats by using her psychic powers to move the puck.Biff Raunch: A burly biker type who is extremely competent at the game. Has no weaknesses. Presents the game's hardest challenge. [CR]The player also has the ability to adjust the bounce and power of the paddle in the options menu.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] No Loss Game[CR]Enter 326075 as a password - in doing so, you will hear the same sound as if you had entered a wrong password.

				<title_clean>Side Pocket</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Created especially for the US market by Data East (though later released in Japan), Side Pocket is a pool simulator that saw several different ports for the various consoles of the era. The game is set around the tournament scene and gets progressively more difficult as the player goes from venue to venue, eventually entering a global competition.[CR]The WonderSwan version is the last game that Data East released before their bankruptcy.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game controls like many pool simulators (as well as several golf simulators of the time) by allowing the player to select which direction they wish to hit the cue ball in, with a handy dotted line to indicate its trajectory, and then they must tap a button to start the power gauge and tap it again to stop at the desired level of power. The balls then move around and if a ball is potted (provided it wasn't the cue ball) then the player is able to take an immediate additional turn. Play continues until the 8 ball has been sunk.[CR]Side Pocket is notable for how it tabulates a player's score: As well as scoring points for winning the game, sinking several balls consecutively and sinking them in numerical order, there are occasionally times where a pocket will light up and the player is able to score a bonus if they're able to sink a ball in that particular pocket. These points are racked up at the end of the match and dictate the overall score.[CR]Occasionally there is an opportunity for a bonus trick shot after the game is over to score additional points. These tend to involve potting specific balls in specific pockets, sometimes while avoiding obstacles on the table.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 256 Balls[CR]Start the game and at the "Let's Challenge" screen, press Left, Right, Right, B, Right, Left, B, Left, B, Right, Left &amp; B. Let the game begin itself without pressing Start. If done right, you'll have 256 tries to spare.</plot>

				<title_clean>Sky Kid</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]NES title screenSky Kid is a side-scrolling horizontal shooter created by Namco. It originally ran on Namco's arcade hardware, and was later published by Sunsoft for the  Famicom and NES. It can be played solo or with two players simultaneously.StorySky Kid has the player cast in the roles of the Red Baron or the Blue Max. These two pilots are based on the famous flying ace of  World War I (Manfred von Richtofen, the Red Baron), and the Prussian order Pour le Merite (the Blue Max), though this is a very loose association with those historical figures. The game takes place in a fantastical reinterpretation of the aerial battles of World War I, where the player must dodge and shoot their way to an assigned bombing target. GameplaySky Kid is played as a  two-dimensional side-scrolling horizontal shooter, using an eight-way joystick and two buttons. One of the buttons fires the plane's gun, and the other performs a defensive flip maneuver, during which the plane cannot be harmed; hammering on the flip button will also help bring the plane out of a stall if it's been hit by gunfire or flak  cannons.Obtaining the bomb and hitting the bombing target gives lots of pointsEach level of the game tasks the player to fly through an onslaught of airborne and surface enemies. Near the end of each level there is always a main bombing target, such as a base, factory, or large battleship. In each level a bomb will be placed close to that target. The player must fly low and pick up the bomb, then deliver it to the target, taking care not to do a defensive flip as that is the same button that drops the bomb. It is not necessary to bomb a target in order to finish a level, but doing so will yield considerably more  points. Sky Kid is an odd duck among horizontal shooters in that it scrolls from right-to-left, as opposed to left-to-right like Gradius or R-Type. The plane's gun also has a very short range, so the player must be close to an enemy to successfully attack. Also contrary to the typical horizontal shooter, flying up or down will cause the plane's nose to pitch up or down 45 degrees; this pitch also changes the direction of the plane's shot until it rights itself again. Finally, the player must successfully hit a landing strip at the end of each level or run out of fuel and crash. All of these idiosyncrasies add up to a shooter that is very different, and very difficult compared to its contemporary, and even modern cousins.Sky Kid can be played by one or two players. A two-player game will be played simultaneously. In Sky Kid, firendly fire is always on, and players' shots and bombs will send the other player into a tailspin. Misplaced shots during this mode can quickly turn a cooperative game into a fiercely competitive one.[CR]Trivia and Secrets[CR]Doing a flip in some areas will change elements in the background. For example: there are some areas where the sun appears in the background, and flipping near the sun will change it into the moon, and the day will become night. This has no impact on gameplay, but it's an interesting twist.Shooting the girls at the end of the landing strip will turn them into smiling, dancing puffs of smoke.Sky Kid was the first Namco arcade game that allowed two-player cooperative play. Sky Kid has been referenced in later Namco games such as Ridge Racer, Ridge Racer 2, Ace Combat 5, Ace Combat 6, and Taiko Drum Master.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]While playing, if you are hit by an enemy, hold Up and rapidly hit A &amp; B at the same time. If done right, you'll ship will recover.</plot>

Now Nick and Tom find themselves with abilities dealing with snow and ice. These two Snow Brothers will need to hunt down the evil King Scorch and rescue the princesses.[CR]Snow Bros. is a fixed-screen platform game where players must defeat all enemies on each level (screen), 50 altogether. The Snow Bros use snow as their weapon, throwing it at the enemies to stun them. When lots of snow is thrown at an enemy, it becomes covered in a flurry and unable to move. These can be rolled into giant snowballs and pushed or kicked into other enemies. If left alone, enemies will eventually defrost and become angry at the player. The enemy filled snowballs are a much stronger weapon then the regular handful of snow and are the only effective weapon Nick and Tom have against the bosses.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/snow-bros-nick-tom[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The quest for the staff of Demnos[CR]As the full moon rose high above Kastlerock on the eve of the winter solstice, Morbius the Malevolent grinned a wicked grin and continued to ready the impending ritual, the sacrifice of a helpless damsel to the forces of darkness in return for total domination of the world. But this was no simple girl, he thought in his black and twisted mind, this was the beautiful Princess Eleanor of Arcadia, the land of his sworn enemy. It was too perfect, too perfect.[CR]Not even that accursed Staff of Demnos could stand in his way now. For years his spies had used every conceivably horrible method to find it, and if they could not succeed, surely no one else would. Besides, with or without the magic Staff, his evil plans would succeed. With or without it, he would become the supreme symbol of evil, the Black Baron of Darkness. Then all would be forced to grovel at his feet. And he would plunge the world into a deathly darkness from which it would never return. Everything was prepared. Nothing could stop him now![CR]The fearsome fortress of Kastlerock had long been the stronghold of Morbius the Malevolent. Built high atop a tremendous cliff of jagged rock, rising straight up from the Sea of Sorrows, the castle had withstood the onslaught of many great armies over the centuries.[CR]Rumors of secret halls and rooms protected by deadly black magic and ferocious man eating beasts had entered the legends of old by the few fortunate prisoners who had escaped Morbius' torturous clutches. They trembled while talking of the dreaded Caves of the Doomed Souls, an endless labyrinth of catacombs carved out of the shear rock cliff far beneath the castle walls. The words crept from their tongues when they spoke of the four deadly towers of the main castle, as if with a mere mention they could be transported back by some of Morbius' evil black magic.[CR]Brave men cowered in fear when they heard the terrible tales of torture in the Gardens of Pain and the Blood Gardens just to the west of the castle. Women and children wept when told of the grisly horrors that befell the unsuspecting who wandered aimlessly through the Slaughter Yards that protected the Tower of Tears at the northernmost boundary of Kastlerock. And few words could describe the hideous screams of terror from the foolhardy who mistakenly tumbled into the Mines of Insanity, never to be heard from again.[CR]But, no stories could compare with those of the eastern grounds of the castle where the Tower of Ultimate Terror stood surrounded by the gruesome Stonehedge Gardens whose massive walls were said to be made from the crushed bones of Morbius' unfortunate victims. Of the Tower itself, little was known. Many believed that it was the site of Morbius' secret workshop; such an overwhelming sense of fear hung about its walls. Certainly, it was the source of his evil powers; as for many days now a black cloud could be seen pouring forth from it, spreading across the land, and choking off the last hopeful rays of the sun.[CR]The old sorcerer Shadax stood at the foot of the great cliff of Kastlerock and stared into the blackness above. Having sailed unseen across the Sea of Sorrows, he now set his mind firmly on the task at hand. He knew a secret way into the castle, a way unknown to even Morbius himself. He'd discovered it by carefully translating the ancient rune maps and poetry he'd found in the Library of the Oracles in far off Arcadia. But he knew getting in was the least of his worries. After all, Morbius would never expect that someone would actually want to get into Kastlerock.[CR]Hopefully, his disguise would provide him with the element of surprise he so needed. After all, who would suspect that an old man could cause any trouble in such a deadly powerful place. But he was not the withered old beggar he appeared. His true identity remained safely concealed beneath his tattered cloak and hat, and there it would stay until he possessed the strength he needed to confront Morbius. For powerful as Shadax was, he was still no match for the vast forces of darkness growing daily in the hands of the evil Baron. For this task he needed the strongest of allies; he needed the awesome power of the Staff of Demnos.[CR]According to legend, this magical Staff had been forged long long ago in the mystical fires of the mythical Elf Kingdom of Old Earth. And legend had it that he who possessed this mighty weapon, would rule Heaven and Earth. How it had wound up in the hands of mankind is a tale far too long to tell here, but in the wise hands of the Ancient kings of Arcadea, it had provided centuries of peace and prosperity.[CR]However, many years ago, for fear that it would fall into Morbius' increasingly powerful grip, the Staff had been beoken into six pieces, a spell of invisibility had been cast upon them, and they were scattered to the far corners of the continent. But, once again Shadax knew something his enemy did not.[CR]If the ancient rune poems were true, the pieces of the staff had been hidden in the last place Morbius would ever think to look: in his own castle. And only once every hundred years, would the spell be broken, allowing the pieces of the staff to be seen once again by human eyes; on the eve of the winter solstice when the full moon rode high in the heavens. That is if the ancient poems were true... if he could even find where the staff was hidden in this deadly place... if, if, if...[CR]But, this was not a time for idle thinking. Morbius had sent most of his vile forces throughout the land in search of the broken pieces of the magical staff leaving Kastlerock thinly guarded. If ever Shadax's plan were to succeed, it would be this night. It was time to claim his rightful place as a king among men, or vanish anonymously into the black abyss of history.[CR]--From the NES Solstice instruction manual.[CR]http://consoleclassix.com/nes/solstice.html[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In this game, you play the role of either Son Son or Ton Ton as you try to rescue your three friends from the clutches of a random bad guy who kidnapped them right in front of you. This game is a side scrolling adventure, where the game field advances automatically, and the screen is divided in six different floors, all of which are populated by enemies or obstacles that will kill you if you touch them; but both Son Son and Ton Ton attack their enemies by shooting small bullets at them out of their weapons (a magic cane and a pitchfork, respectively). Their attack can also stop many enemy projectiles! Your chosen character must jump from floor to floor, evading hunters, bats, fish, statues, insects, skull coins, and mad bombers! As you advance, you can pick up several food items to increase your score. Clearing the screen of enemies will also net you several hefty bonuses.[CR]The story is heavily based upon "Journey To The West"; the player characters as well as the kidnapped ones are based upon the main characters in the story. This game is also a port of Capcom's original arcade game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Invincibility[CR]At the title screen, quickly enter:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Harder Gameplay[CR]Clear the game once, and the next playthrough will have more enemies to fight, thus making it harder.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Space Harrier (&#12473;&#12506;&#12540;&#12473;&#12495;&#12522;&#12450;&#12540; Sup&#275;su Hari&#257;) is a third-person rail shooter game. It was developed by Sega AM2 and created by legendary developer, Yu Suzuki, responsible for many popular Sega games. The game was published by Sega and originally released in the arcades in October 1985. Since then, the game has been released on a number of platforms and spawned many sequels.[CR]Using Sega's Super Scaler 16-bit graphics technology, the game produced pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates, with the ability to scale as many as 32,000 sprites and fill a moving landscape with them, along with 6144 colors on screen out of a 98,304 color palette (15-bit RGB high color depth with shadow &amp; highlight).[CR]It also introduced a true analog flight stick for movement, with the ability to register movement in any direction as well as measure the degree of push, which could move the player character at different speeds depending on how far the stick is pushed in a certain direction. It also introduced a motion-based, hydraulic cockpit arcade cabinet, which moved in the direction the player moved the joystick. The game was also an early example of a third-person shooter; it was influenced by the earlier 1982 Sega game Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom, and Space Harrier in turn influenced later 3D shooters such as Nintendo's Star Fox (Starwing) in 1993.[CR]Running on the Sega Space Harrier arcade system board previously used by Hang-On, the pseudo-3D sprite/tile scaling in the game was handled in a similar manner to textures in later texture-mapped polygonal 3D games of the 1990s. Yu Suzuki stated that his "designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from Hang-On. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D."[1] The game's success established Suzuki as the leading arcade game designer at the time.[2][CR]Space Harrier later saw ports to many home game systems.Space Harrier's release on the Sega Master System home console is particularly notable, as there were two versions: one was a port of the arcade game, while the other, entitled Space Harrier 3-D (1988), supported the SegaScope stereoscopic 3D glasses. The game also spawned the sequel Space Harrier II (1988) and the spin-off Planet Harriers (2000).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]"Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready!"[CR]The game takes place in a unique place called the "Fantasy Zone" (no deeper plot is associated with Space Harrier). The Fantasy zone is a place filled with many strange creatures like one-eyed mammoths, alien pods, strange looking dragons, robots and flying mushrooms etc. The main character is a man with a giant gun/rocket that allows him to fly around. He runs along in a pseudo 3D level blasting anything that comes at him.[CR]The game has the player moving forward at all times and many enemies will get in the player's way, blasting projectiles and moving along in a certain pattern. The player must also do his or her best to move out of harm's way while shooting at anything that's presented on screen. Most objects are destructible, but some are not. If the player gets hit once, he or she will lose a life. The player starts off with two lives, and an extra life can be gained if the player racks up 500,000 points.The arcade version.[CR]The points will gradually increase as the player keeps moving. More points will be given for every thing that is destroyed by the player.[CR]There are eighteen stages in the game and a boss fight is presented in the end of sixteen of the stages. Two of the stages, stage 5 and stage 12, are bonus levels. The main character will jump on a dragon-like creature and destroy as many objects - trees, stone poles and bushes - as he or she can.Stages:The third stage, Amar.Stage 1: MootStage 2: GeezaStage 3: AmarStage 4: CiecielStage 5: Bonus StageStage 6: OlisisStage 7: LucasiaStage 8: IdaStage 9: ReviStage 10: MiniaStage 11: ParmsStage 12: Bonus StageStage 13: DrailStage 14: AsuteStage 15: VicelStage 16: NaturaStage 17: NarkStage 18: AbsymbelThe bonus stage.[CR]Arcade cabinets[CR]There were several different arcade cabinets. The first two were the standard upright and sit-down cabinets, which introduced the use of an analog flight stick that, for the first time, detected movement in 360 directions as well as the degree of push. The first port to feature similar analog stick controls was the version that appeared in Shenmue for the Dreamcast in 1999.[CR]The third was a new type of deluxe cabinet: the "rolling" cabinet. The "rolling" type moved the entire cabinet in the direction the player moved the analog flight stick, left/right and forward/backward, simulating flight movement for the first time in an arcade cabinet. The first port to simulate the rolling type deluxe arcade cabinet was Space Harrier 3D, which utilized the Nintendo 3DS's gyroscope motion sensor, in 2012.[CR]Sega Space Harrier arcade hardware[CR]The arcade hardware used to run the game is widely known as the Sega Space Harrier system, or less commonly known as the Sega Hang-On system. It utilized two boards: the CPU (Central Processing Unit) mother board, and the Super Scaler graphics board which handled the game's complex sprite-scaling. The game displayed 128 sprites per frame, at 60 frames per second, scaling 7680 sprites per second. The graphics board itself is capable of scaling up to 32,000 sprites per second with more memory, as was the case with later Super Scaler titles.Technical specificationsCPU (Central Processing Unit) mother boardMain CPU processors: 2x Motorola MC 68000 (16/32-bit) @ 10 MHz each Performance: 3.5 MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)Additional CPU: Intel 8751 (8-bit) @ 8 MHzSound CPU: Zilog Z80 (8-bit) @ 4 MHz Performance: 580,000 IPS (Instructions Per Second)Stereo sound chips FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesis chip: Yamaha YM2203 @ 4 MHz Channels: 3 FM channels, 3 SSG (Software-controlled Sound Generator) channelsPCM (Pulse-Code Modulation) chip: SegaPCM @ 8 MHz Channels: 16 PCM 8-bit channels @ 31.25 KHz sampling rateRAM (Random Access Memory) Program RAM: 32 KBAudio RAM: 2 KBROM (Read-Only Memory) Program EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM) memory: 448 KBAudio EPROM: 192 KBAudio ROM for PCM audio samples: Up to 16 MBSuper Scaler GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) boardGPU: Sega Super Scaler 171-5320 graphics card Sega 315-5011 sprite line comparitorSega 315-5012 sprite generator2x Sega 315-5049 tilemap chipsSega PAL chipset: 2x Sega 315-5107 horizontal timing controlSega 315-5108 vertical timing controlSega 315-5122 timing chipDisplay resolution: 320 x 224 pixelsColours on screen: 6,144Colour palette: 32,768 (15-bit colour)Frame rate: 60 frames per secondSprites displayed per frame: 128Sprites displayed per second: 7680Sprites scaled per second: Up to 32,000Hardware layers: 2 tile layers1 text layer1 sprite layer with hardware sprite zooming1 road layerTranslucent shadowsVRAM (Video RAM) memory: 192 KB high-speed SRAM (Static RAM)Graphics EPROM: 1152 KB[CR]Console ports[CR]The game was ported to several Sega consoles, such as the Sega 32X, and Sega Saturn. It also found its way to numerous computers and consoles of its era, often with various compromises in quality. The 32X version is one of the earliest ports to match quality with the arcade game, though even it cuts a couple of corners here and there. The Saturn version, released in Japan as "Sega Ages: Space Harrier" is also a pretty faithful version of the game. This version of the game also appeared in the US with two other games on a compilation disc simply called Sega Ages.[CR]The two Master System versions, including Space Harrier 3-D, reduced the graphical quality and speed quite a bit, but still managed to be a recognizable port of the original game. The first Master System version, released in 1986, was the first home video game cartridge to feature 2 Megabits (256 Kilobytes) of memory. The second Master System version, Space Harrier 3-D, featured the use of stereoscopic 3D graphics. The Master System versions also contain a new final boss fight against two glowing dragon creatures known as "Haya Oh." This new boss fight also appears in the X68000 version of the game. The Game Gear version of the game shares some of the basic quality issues as the Master System release, but contains different levels, an adjusted resolution, and a password system for continuing from later levels.Space Harrier, featured in Shenmue.[CR]The game was also featured in the game Shenmue. Space Harrier was located in the "You Arcade" building in the Dobuita area of the game; the player has to pay one-hundred yen to play the game. The "Sega Saturn" version of Space Harrier was also featured as a prize in the raffle in some of the convenience stores. The Sega Saturn version can be played on Ryo's Sega Saturn that is located in his living room.[CR]A polygonal remake of the game was made as part of Sega's Sega Ages series in Japan. The polygonal version of Space Harrier was released outside of Japan in the form of Sega Classics Collection.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Arcade version[CR]The arcade game was well received upon release. It became one of 1986's chart hits in the arcades. Computer and Video Games magazine reviewed the arcade game in its March 1986 issue, after reviewer Clare Edgeley played it at the 1986 ATEI (Amusement Trades Exhibition International) show in London, along with the arcade version of Super Mario Bros. She stated, "Perhaps the games to steal the show were" Space Harrier along with Shrike Avenger (1986), praising their hydraulic cockpit cabinets that "twist, turn and move" in the same direction as the joystick, making them "the most realistic" simulators "to date". She praised Space Harrier's "excellent graphics" for being "all in 3D with amazing technicolour landscapes" and a "multitude of objects" on screen, as well as "the sounds of the battle" output by "large speakers" where "you could almost lose touch with reality". She also praised the gameplay for being "exciting" and "very fast" paced, as well as the continue feature, but stated the game can be "very difficult."[CR]Clare Edgeley gave the arcade game a retrospective review in the February 1987 issue of Sinclair User, where she noted it had one of the first hydraulic arcade cabinets she had seen, along with 1986's Shrike Avenger. She stated that Space Harrier's "fabulously colourful 3D graphics" and "the movement of the sit-in cabinet were, and still are, breathtaking", noting "the seat-belt" and "turbulent" ride which "hurls you up, down, left and right" and tilts "the cabinet in a roll in whatever direction you push your joystick", concluding the game to be "great fun."Home conversionsReview scoresPublicationScoreComputer and Video Games70% (C64)68% (ZX)40% (CPC)[3]CRASH77% (ZX)Famitsu34/40 (3DS)Sinclair User (ZX)Your Sinclair9/10 (ZX)The Milwaukee Journal9/10 (SMS)AwardsEntityAwardGolden Joystick AwardsGame of the Year (Runner&#8209;Up)[CR]The home conversions were also well received. The game was runner-up in the category of Game of the Year at the 1986 Golden Joystick Awards.[CR]The Milwaukee Journal in May 1987 gave the Master System version a positive review, rating it a score of 9 out of 10. The reviewer Edward J. Semrad described the Master System version of Space Harrier as "the latest innovation" and "the most powerful cartridge ever made for any computer or game system." He concluded it "sets new standards in audio, graphic detail, memory and price ($40 list)."[CR]The September 1988 issue of Computer Gaming World (page 50) called Space Harrier "the best arcade shoot-'em-up of the year ... as exciting a game as this reviewer has ever played".[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The flying furry creature in the bonus stages is very similar to Falkor, the flying dog-dragon from the 1984 film, The NeverEnding Story.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Space Invaders</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]One of the earliest shooting games, Space Invaders was released by Taito in Japan on June 19, 1978. Gameplay involves attempting to defeat waves of aliens cascading down from the top of the screen with a laser cannon that moves along a fixed horizontal axis. The only goal is to earn as many points as possible. Designer Tomohiro Nishikado was in charge of planning, graphic design, and programming for the game and drew creative inspiration from such diverse sources as Gun Fight, Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. The game&#8217;s development cycle lasted for one year, during which Nishikado created custom hardware and software. The game achieved massive popularity upon its release (leading to a temporary shortage of one hundred yen coins in Japan), and helped usher in the golden age of arcade video games (circa 1978-1984).[CR]Space Invaders sold over 400,000 arcade cabinets worldwide and grossed around $3.8 billion in revenue by 1982, equivalent to over $13 billion in 2014, making it the highest-grossing video game of all time.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade (cabaret/cocktail) version[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in Space Invaders is relatively simple. The player controls a small ship that can only move laterally across the bottom of the screen and fires vertically. Five rows of eleven aliens each advance slowly from one side of the screen to the other, dropping down one space and reversing direction when they reach either side. The player&#8217;s task is to acquire points by eliminating enemies and to destroy all of the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen and complete their &#8220;invasion.&#8221; As aliens are destroyed, the speed of the remaining enemies increases, as does the tempo of the music. Once all of the enemies are destroyed, the wave resets and the difficulty increases (a cycle that can continue indefinitely).[CR]The Invaders constantly shoot back at the player as they advance from side to side across the screen. To help avoid their attacks, the player can hide behind a number of destructible barriers or &#8220;bunkers&#8221; near the bottom of the screen (four in the original version). Occasionally a &#8220;mystery ship&#8221; will appear near the top of the screen and move quickly from one side to the other while making a distinctive klaxon noise. Destroying it rewards the player with a sizeable point bonus.[CR]Development[CR]While working for the Taito Corporation, designer Nishikado was inspired to create Space Invaders by an early Taito electro-mechanical game called Space Monsters, and by the Atari arcade game Breakout. The game was planned to have tanks, planes, and battleships as enemies, but Nishikado was not happy with their onscreen movements. He considered making the enemies human (which would have been easier to animate), but scrapped the idea since he thought it would be immoral for players to shoot them. After he saw a magazine featuring the 1977 film Star Wars, he decided to use a space theme, and based his alien enemies on the squid-like antagonists from the 1953 movie version of The War of the Worlds.Upright cabinet[CR]Due to the limitations of 1970s microprocessors, Nishikado was forced to design and build his own hardware and development tools. The arcade board he put together contained a variety of both Japanese and American components. It used an Intel 8080 central processing unit (designed by American and Japanese engineers), which could output raster graphics on a CRT monitor, but was slow when it came to drawing sprite graphics, so a dedicated Fujitsu MB14241 video shifter (an early example of a graphics chip) was used to accelerate the drawing of sprite graphics to a bitmap framebuffer. Monaural sound was hosted by a combination of analogue circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip. The system that he put together is now known as the Taito 8080 arcade system board.[CR]In spite of his efforts, Nishikado was unable to program the game exactly as he wanted. The hardware that he had assembled was not powerful enough to display graphics in color and the enemies moved slower than he had intended. Fortunately he discovered that the more enemies that were removed from play, the faster the processor could render those that remained. Rather than attempt to design the game to compensate for the speed increase, he opted to leave it in as a challenging gameplay mechanic.[CR]It was originally released in Japan by Taito as a cocktail cabinet, with monochrome graphics enhanced by a rainbow-colored cellophane overlay to simulate color graphics. Taito and American licence-holder Bally/Midway then created an upright cabinet that used strips of orange and green cellophane applied to the screen to simulate color graphics, though this version only simulated several colors (compared to Taito's original cocktail version simulating a wider range of colors). Both the Japanese and American upright cabinets also included a painted backdrop of a lunar surface and a starscape, and cabinet art featuring large humanoid creatures that bore little resemblance to the in-game enemies. Nishikado claims that this was due to the artist basing his interpretation on the game&#8217;s original title, Space Monsters.[CR]Impact and Legacy[CR]Soon after its release in Japan, Space Invaders became a huge success, completely taking over certain arcades and earning Taito a tidy profit. By the end of 1978, Taito had installed 100,000 machines across the country and grossed over $600 million dollars. An oft-quoted urban legend states that there was a shortage of 100-yen coins&#8212;and subsequent production increase&#8212;in Japan attributed to the game. By 1980, 300,000 cabinets had been sold in Japan and an additional 60,000 in the United States. By 1981, Space Invaders had made Taito more than $1 billion, and continued to gross an average of $600 million per year, through to 1982, by which time it had grossed $2 billion in quarters (equivalent to $4.6 billion in 2011). This made it the best-selling video game and highest-grossing entertainment product of its time, surpassing the then highest-grossing film Star Wars, which had grossed $486 million in movie tickets.Atari 2600 version[CR]The 1980 Atari 2600 version represented the first official licensed port of an arcade game to a home console, and and became the first "killer app" for video game consoles by quadrupling sales of the 2600. It sold over two million units in its first year on sale as a home console game, becoming the first title to sell over a million cartridges. Ports were also released for the Atari 8-bit computer line and the Atari 5200, as well as the Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy and SNES. Numerous unofficial clones were made as well, such as the popular computer games Super Invader (1979) and TI Invaders (1981).[CR]Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto considered Space Invaders a game that revolutionized the video game industry; he was never interested in video games before seeing it. Hideo Kojima also described it as the first video game that impressed him and got him interested in video games. Several publications ascribed the expansion of the video game industry from a novelty into a global industry to the success of the game. Edge magazine attributed the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores to Space Invaders. Its popularity was such that it was the first game where an arcade machine's owner could make up for the cost of the machine in under one month, or in some places within one week.[CR]Technology journalist Jason Whittaker credited the game's success to ending the video game crash of 1977, which had earlier been caused by Pong clones flooding the market, and beginning the golden age of video arcade games.According to The Observer, the home console versions were popular and encouraged users to learn programming; many who later became industry leaders. 1UP stated that Space Invaders showed that video games could compete against the major entertainment media at the time: movies, music, and television IGN attributed the launch of the arcade phenomenon in North America in part to Space Invaders. Electronic Games credited the game's success as the impetus behind video gaming becoming a rapidly growing hobby and as "the single most popular coin-operated attraction of all time." Game Informer considered it, along with Pac-Man, one of the most popular arcade games that tapped into popular culture and generated excitement during the golden age of arcades.IGN listed it as one of the "Top 10 Most Influential Games" in 2007, citing the source of inspiration to video game designers and the impact it had on the shooting genre. 1UP ranked it at No. 3 in its list of "The 60 Most Influential Games of All Time," stating that, in contrast to earlier arcade games which "were attempts to simulate already-existing things," Space Invaders was "the first video game as a video game, instead of merely a playable electronic representation of something else." In 2008, Guinness World Records listed it as the top-rated arcade game in technical, creative, and cultural impact.[CR]As one of the earliest shooting games, it set precedents and helped pave the way for future titles and for the shooting genre. Space Invaders popularized a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player controlled cannon's movement, and was the first video game to popularize the concept of achieving a high score, being the first to save the player's score. While earlier shooting games allowed the player to shoot at targets, Space Invaders was the first in which targets could fire back at the player. It was also the first game where players were given multiple lives, had to repel hordes of enemies, could take cover from enemy fire, and use destructible barriers,in addition to being the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack, with four simple diatonic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, which was dynamic and changed pace during stages, like a heartbeat sound that increases pace as enemies approached.[CR]It also introduced the concept of a difficulty curve, with the aliens moving faster as the player kills more of them, making the game more difficult as it progresses. The game's concept of scaling difficulty became the basis for modern single-player video gaming.[CR]Cited by influential creators like Shigeru Miyamoto and Hideo Kojima as a major inspiration, Space Invaders revolutionized the industry following the video game crash of 1977 (brought on by a glut of Pong clones on the market and the departure of manufacturers like RCA and Fairchild). Proving that video games were capable of competing with movies, music and television, Space Invaders has since become recognized as one of the most influential games ever released. It was one of the first games to utilize the concept of a &#8220;high score,&#8221; and was the first to save the player&#8217;s score. It was the first shooter that allowed enemies to shoot back at the player, the first to give the player multiple lives and provide destructible cover against enemy fire. Its success effectively launched an entire genre of space shooters, including Atari&#8217;s Asteroids, Williams&#8217; Defender, and Namco&#8217;s Galaxian series.[CR]It moved the gaming industry away from Pong-inspired sports games grounded in real-world situations towards action games involving fantastical situations. Whittaker commented that Space Invaders helped action games become the most dominant genre on both arcades and consoles, through to contemporary times. Guinness World Records considered Space Invaders one of the most successful arcade shooting games by 2008. In describing it as a "seminal arcade classic", IGN listed it as the number eight "classic shoot 'em up". Space Invaders set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. Its worldwide success created a demand for a wide variety of science fiction games, inspiring the development of arcade games, such as Atari's Asteroids, Williams Electronic's Defender, and Namco's Galaxian and Galaga, which were modeled after Space Invaders' gameplay and design. This influence extends to most shooting games released to the present day, including first-person shooters such as Wolfenstein, Doom, Halo, and Call of Duty. Space Invaders also had an influence on early computer dungeon crawl games such as Dungeons of Daggorath, which used similar heartbeat sounds to indicate player health. Space Invaders' concept of a gradually increasing difficulty level also revolutionized the gaming industry.Remakes and sequelsSpace Invaders '95, one of many sequels[CR]Recent ports and remakes include Space Invaders Anniversary, released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 and including nine variants of the core game. Space Invaders, Space Invaders Part II and Return of the Invaders were featured in the arcade compilation Taito Legends (released in 2005), and Space Invaders '91, Space Invaders '95, and Space Invaders DX were featured in Taito Legends 2 (released in 2006). A remake of the game called Space Invaders Extreme was released for the PSP and Nintendo DS in 2008 and on Xbox Live Arcade in 2009. A second remake, Space Invaders Infinity Gene, was released in 2009 on PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and iOS devices.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Spelunker</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Originally released in 1983 for Atari's 8-bit family of computers, Spelunker stars a frail, suspender-clad miner whose goal is to reach the bottom of a colossal cave and find the treasure within. Complicating this task is a variety of instantly fatal obstacles; including geysers, noxious bat guano, malevolent ghosts, and a variety of perilous terrain.[CR][B]History:[/B][CR]Spelunker was originally developed in 1983 by Micro Graphic Image, which largely consisted of former employees of Games By Apollo, an early third-party developer for the Atari 2600, as well as one of the first software companies to declare bankruptcy in the North American video game crash of '83. One of these employees was Tim Martin, whose name is attached to every version of Spelunker, including the 2009 sequel, Spelunker HD.[CR]At the time, it was fairly common practice to have a developer's name attached to the title itself, &#224; la Sid Meier or Will Wright. While Robert Barber and Cash Foley are credited as co-creating Spelunker, it was decided that Tim would receive top billing as he had developed the "game logic" and had come up with the original idea. The developers at MicroGraphic Image were confident that Spelunker would be the first of many games to come so eventually they'd all have their chance to place their name at the front of a game.[CR]Unfortunately, Spelunker was released for Atari 8-bit in 1983 while the gaming recession was in full swing. After the initial release, Micro Graphic Image turned publication of Spelunker over to Broderbund who then went on to produce the Commodore 64 version of the title, as well as license it out to IREM who created the NES and arcade versions. While Micro Graphic Image never went bankrupt, they ceased operations in 1984.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The opening moments of Spelunker on the NES.[CR]In Spelunker, the hero begins by entering the cave from the very top, with his goal to reach the treasure at the bottom of the massive cavern by traversing over obstacles, climbing ropes, utilizing mine carts, elevators and more. In order to reach his goal, the hero must collect items to replenish his constantly depleting air supply, bombs to clear rocks from the path, keys to open locked doors and other power-ups to aid his quest.[CR]Complicating this task is myriad fatal obstacles. Players are instantly killed when colliding with rushing water, uneven terrain, breakaway ledges, geysers, pillars of fire, and more all threaten the hero. As well as this, there are numerous jumps that require pinpoint accuracy.[CR]The game tends to place the hero in his last known place of safety with no warning and full control, making very rapid deaths a common occurrence for new players.[CR]Ropes are prevalent throughout the cave and represent one of the biggest hazards found in Spelunker. In the NES and MSX versions, when the hero is holding on to a rope, the player must press in the direction they want him to jump prior to actually pressing the jump button. This causes the hero to actually shimmy along the rope before jumping, and can cause him to fall off resulting in a death.[CR]Bats inhabit the cave and and drop deadly guano on the player, which can be avoided with carefully timed movements. Bats can also be temporarily neutralized via the use of a flare.[CR]The most deadly of all the creatures, however, are the ghosts that inhabit the cave and are signalled to the player with a musical theme. The hero is armed with a "flash gun" that can be used to expel the ghosts, but there are a few caveats to this. First, the player must have a flash gun item in stock, though this is a very common item. The ghost must also be visible on the screen when using the flash gun and in order to use it in the first place, the hero must be standing perfectly still, making him vulnerable to other elements of the cave, not to mention the draining of his oxygen bar.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]In recent years, a totally inexplicable wave of nostalgia for this unfairly difficult platformer has swept through a niche population of Japanese gamers, though the movement continued to gain more mainstream acceptance through the continuing efforts of the most notable licensee of the Spelunker franchise, IREM.[CR]Spelunker made its Japanese debut in December 1985 for the Nintendo Famicom where it is perceived to have sold fairly well, but was also met with a significant backlash. Many players were dismayed at the insane difficulty of the title and either returned or traded it in to used game shops. Over the years, the Famicom version of Spelunker gained a reputation in Japan as something of a mascot of used game bins, as its not uncommon to find dozens of copies of the game at used game shops throughout Japan. This distinction led to many gamers of its era to look back pseudo-fondly on the time they received Spelunker as a child and were utterly destroyed by it.[CR]Spelunker nostalgia is most common in Japanese Internet culture, where the hero can be found starring in videos such as the popular "Michael Quest III" flash animation, fan art on the popular 2ch forum, music recitals, cosplay and of course, countless videos found on Nico Video, the "YouTube of Japan".[CR]At TGS 2008, IREM announced an HD update to Spelunker called Minna de Spelunker to be released in 2009 for the PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network. While it's commonly referred to as a "remake", that is not technically accurate, as Spelunker HD, as the game is called in English-speaking territories, does not contain any of the levels found in any of the original game. Instead, it features a "retro" mode that features the classic graphics of the NES version of the title, only with whole new levels and gameplay elements, including online co-op play.[CR]Since the success of Spelunker HD, the nostalgia has only grown stronger; From Software used a 3D version of the game's fragile hero as one of the pre-designed templates for the customizable hero in their action-RPG, 3D Dot Game Heroes.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Spelunker, originally created by Tim Martin and published by Broderbund in 1983, was at one point licensed out to Irem so that they could create a Famicom version a few years later in 1985. Spelunker II is the sequel to that Famicom version. Its subtitle means something like "Challenge of the Hero".[CR]Spelunker II was notable for its infusion of RPG elements to the standard Spelunker frame of exploring caves in a side-scrolling platformer fashion. For one, the player can choose between multiple characters to play as, each with varying stats and abilities, and equip them. The player character now has a health bar, rather than the "one hit kill" status of Spelunker's fragile protagonist.[CR]Odder is the concept of "toku", or virtue. Performing heinous acts such as slaughtering innocent wildlife will, upon entering one of the holes of the game, send the player directly to the underworld to be judged by a demon for their actions. Players must ensure their actions are moral if they are to proceed with purloining artifacts from pre-industrial societies.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Spelunker II uses a 3/4 view that had recently been popularized by Konami's Ganbare Goemon, allowing the player to move left and right but also up and down at specifically marked locations to enter new areas. Players can attack with the default sword, a short-range weapon, or attack from a distance with a long-range weapon with limited ammo.[CR]Players can also explore dungeons and caves, much like the original Spelunker, though these tend to be filled with tough enemies. Worse are the supernatural enemies like ghosts and zombies, which are immune to the player's default weapons until they can locate a crucifix item with which to combat them. Even so, the player needs high toku in order to use it.[CR]The three heroes the player can choose from include: The Explorer, the default gun-toting character and one of the few carry-overs from the first Spelunker; the Esper, a psionics user that can fire lightning; and the Wizard, who sends out fireballs.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue (Start of World)[CR]At the game over screen, hold Up and then press Start. You'll continue at the start of the current world, not at where you died. You can only use it on World 2 &amp; 3.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Splatterhouse: Wanpaku Graffiti is the second game in the Splatterhouse franchise. It was only released in Japan on July 31, 1989 for the Famicom. The game was developed and published by Namco. Unlike the first Splatterhouse, Wanpaku Graffiti had "super-deformed" characters, probably due to the hardware of the Famicom. The game is a prequel to Splatterhouse. In Wanpaku Graffiti, the player takes on the role of Rick as he hunts the evil Pumpkin King though seven levels of gameplay.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Despite the game's cuter style, there is a lot of gore.[CR]Wanpaku Graffiti is a beat-'em-up, just like the other games in the Splatterhouse franchise. Despite the game's "cuter" tone, there is still gore (as with other games in the franchise). Rick fights his way through seven levels, filled with a variety of enemies. Wanpaku Graffiti also has a level system. The higher the level, the larger the life bar is. Wanpaku Graffiti also contains numerous references to horror movies such as Alien, The Exorcist, Jaws, and Friday the 13th.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Credits[CR]Press and hold Up, A &amp; Select on the 1st controller, then press Reset. If done right, the credits will be shown.</plot>

				<title_clean>Sqoon</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sqoon is a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System and published by   Irem and developed by  Home Data. It is a side scrolling style of game where you play a pink submarine who must defend earth from the evil aliens of Neptune. At the same time the player must attempt to rescue human survivors and drop them on an island. It had very little adoption in North American and thus was considered a flop.   [CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Earth is being attacked by the Neptunians, an underwater race of alien beings. They do this by melting the polar ice caps, flooding every country across the world. The Neptunians did this because their source of food, man-ham, was depleting due to meteorites turning their world into a desert. So they moved to Earth because of its abundant source of man-ham.  While all of this was taking place, a pirate named Narikeen was mining gold under the oceans of the world using his submarine, named SQOON. When his SQOON was full of gold, he would go into port and trade his gold for grog. But when he tried to go to the port, he realized that it was gone. In fact, all the land was gone!  It was then when he received a message on the radio from the General of the Earth Defense Army warning Narikeen of the Neptunian invasion of the planet Earth. After refusing at first, Narikeen finally agrees to save the trapped humans underwater with his SQOON. He can only carry nine people at a time, transferring them from the underwater base to his motorized floating island.      [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Sqoon borrows plenty of ideas from Gradius, and lays out a lot of ground for Irem's big shooter series, R-Type. The game is a classic example of the side-scrolling shooter genre. What seperates Sqoon from the rest is it's upgrade system, which requires you to release the captured humans, capture nine of them, and successfully stow them away on your motorized floating island in order to upgrade your guns. The main gun has two upgrades. The secondary gun is your classic "below fire" gun, which is used to break open ocean bottom domes, freeing humans.  Another unique gameplay feature found in Sqoon is the fuel meter. In order to keep moving forward, you need to constantly replenish your fuel meter, which starts out at sixty. You lose fuel every second. In order to replenish your fuel, you're given a refill of fuel every time you rescue nine prisoners. You can also gain a full refill by killing one of the crabs on the ground, and exchanging what the crab leaves behind with your motorized floating island. Also on the top left, there is a score counter.       [CR][B]Upgrades:[/B][CR]Starting Weapons:  Horizon Missile - Kills the NeptuniansIce Ball Gun - Destroys bio hot water factory and enemies. When you break the ocean bottom dome with the iceball gun, the humans come swimming out. Rescue them quickly and transfer them to the small motorized island to receive energy for SQOON.  Upgraded Weapons: Bow-wow missile - The first time you power-up, your weapon will be upgraded to the Bob-wow missile. It moves at the same speed as the horizon missile, but it goes through enemies, allowing it to hit any remaining enemies behind it.Adenoid missile - If you have the Bow-wow missile and power-up again, you will have this weapon at your disposal. It is the most powerful missile available, giving the SQOON a spread-shot.   [CR][B]Worlds:[/B][CR]JapanChinaIndiaSaudi ArabiaSwitzerlandHungaryUnited StatesDreamland      [CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]All information is from the games' manual: Sea SlugLook for it around the cities. It picks up the magic necklace that the mermaid Kazumi has dropped. If you hit it with the ice ball a number of times, it will turn into a necklace. If you pick up this necklace and destroy the bio hot water factory the balance of ocean energy will be disturbed and you may be able to go to some other dimension of the world. This is a magical lifeform.CrabIf you shoot it with the ice ball gun, the shell of the crab comes off and you can get the gold inside. Touch the gold to collect it. In a few seconds though, the shell will return and the crab will start walking again. Use your gold well. One gold and one person allows you to refuel from the small motorized island.FlounderThis is the Neptunian scout. If you are killed by this, you're not doing very well. The Pirame dance around the screen.OttottoBaruban (the ruler of the Neptunians) asked someone to create a smart robot, but this is the result. This is a smart robot that needs more brains.TurtleGet away, get away! This turtle is coming! Try to steer clear of this enemy.Neptunian MineAvoid the mines floating in the ocean. You can destroy them with the ice ball gun.KazumiBaruban turned Miss Neptune into a mermaid when they reached Earth to confuse the Earth people. However, Kazumi is innocent Miss Neptune. What should you do?SnailIt used to be a toy for Yarukisu, the son of Baruban. Don't restrain your attack just because it's a child's toy.Spear ShellfishThis is the guard for the Neptunians base. Its thick and hard shell is indestructible, even with horizon missles or ice balls. Avoid them. SunfishIt's the only bio-fish that has a family. It spends all of its time looking for food for the mambouya (little mambo).Child MamboDon't restrain your attack just because this is a little mambo. It's brave and quick. Angler FishLook out! This fish swims extremely fast and straight.SquidThis creature rushes forward suddenly and then stops when it moves. It doesn't play fair-be careful!Flying FishJUMP-JUMP-JUMP! If this is around, you can't get close to the surface of the ocean.Nautilus ShellIt takes three horizon missiles to kill this enemy. If something is spinning and coming, it must be Paachiki.FrogThis amphibian is expressionless because it's actually a statue of a sitting frog.ShrimpIt looks strong, but it can be killed with the ice ball gun. It makes good sushi.Sea HorseThis is a lost sea horse child, looking for its mother across the oceans. Neptunian GhostsThis is a strange ghost which followed Baruban from the planet Neptune.ShellfishIf this sees an enemy, it wants to kill, Look out!SharkIt's the only Earth fish which has been conquered by the Neptunians. It knows that if it follows SQOON, it can get food. It's a man-eating shark.         [CR]Extra[CR] Every time you pass a church, touch a surfer, panda bear, etc., you receive a 1UPThroughout the game's quest, you travel throughout many major countries in the world, including America and China.It is said that Dave from Giant Bomb is a fan of this game.[CR]</plot>

After refusing at first, Narikeen finally agrees to save the trapped humans underwater with his SQOON. He can only carry nine people at a time, transferring them from the underwater base to his motorized floating island.      [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Sqoon borrows plenty of ideas from Gradius, and lays out a lot of ground for Irem's big shooter series, R-Type. The game is a classic example of the side-scrolling shooter genre. What seperates Sqoon from the rest is it's upgrade system, which requires you to release the captured humans, capture nine of them, and successfully stow them away on your motorized floating island in order to upgrade your guns. The main gun has two upgrades. The secondary gun is your classic "below fire" gun, which is used to break open ocean bottom domes, freeing humans.  Another unique gameplay feature found in Sqoon is the fuel meter. In order to keep moving forward, you need to constantly replenish your fuel meter, which starts out at sixty. You lose fuel every second. In order to replenish your fuel, you're given a refill of fuel every time you rescue nine prisoners. You can also gain a full refill by killing one of the crabs on the ground, and exchanging what the crab leaves behind with your motorized floating island. Also on the top left, there is a score counter.       [CR][B]Upgrades:[/B][CR]Starting Weapons:  Horizon Missile - Kills the NeptuniansIce Ball Gun - Destroys bio hot water factory and enemies. When you break the ocean bottom dome with the iceball gun, the humans come swimming out. Rescue them quickly and transfer them to the small motorized island to receive energy for SQOON.  Upgraded Weapons: Bow-wow missile - The first time you power-up, your weapon will be upgraded to the Bob-wow missile. It moves at the same speed as the horizon missile, but it goes through enemies, allowing it to hit any remaining enemies behind it.Adenoid missile - If you have the Bow-wow missile and power-up again, you will have this weapon at your disposal. It is the most powerful missile available, giving the SQOON a spread-shot.

It picks up the magic necklace that the mermaid Kazumi has dropped. If you hit it with the ice ball a number of times, it will turn into a necklace. If you pick up this necklace and destroy the bio hot water factory the balance of ocean energy will be disturbed and you may be able to go to some other dimension of the world. This is a magical lifeform.CrabIf you shoot it with the ice ball gun, the shell of the crab comes off and you can get the gold inside. Touch the gold to collect it. In a few seconds though, the shell will return and the crab will start walking again. Use your gold well. One gold and one person allows you to refuel from the small motorized island.FlounderThis is the Neptunian scout. If you are killed by this, you're not doing very well.

				<plot>In 1855, Tom Sawyer and his friends are growing up in the town of St. Petersburg, Missouri in the United States. Being wild children, Tom Sawyer and his best friend Huckleberry Finn are always getting into new adventures and one kind of trouble or another. So it's not entirely unexpected one day when Tom Sawyer heads off to school and realizes he is late...[CR]Square no Tom Sawyer is a side-scrolling RPG that features characters and situations from Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer novels. Players control Tom himself and up to three other characters who can join his party at any one time. In town, there are a variety of people that can be talked to and shops where items can be bought and sold. Outside of towns, monsters and fierce woodland animals are randomly encountered and must be battled with. When entering battle mode, the game shifts to a third-person view behind Tom's party. The player can issue commands such as Fight, Item and Run to each of the characters in the party and these actions will occur in turn. Battles that are won earn the participating characters experience points. These experience points can be allocated to increase specific stats of characters. Players can accumulate new items for use in battle but never have to deal with equipping characters.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]Insert the code at the game's menu (where you choose whether to start, continue, or adjust the game's speed) using controller 2.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Special Name Passwords[CR]Begin by entering one of the names from the table below as a master name for Tom - this can be done by starting a new game, pressing Select, then choosing the "Master" option and then the "Select" option.

				<plot>Set up R.O.B. with the colored discs included in the game and then control his movements in the game by using Professor Hector to jump onto various blocks. The blocks represent commands given to R.O.B. in sequence.[CR]This game can be played in several different ways.  In the regular game, you have to stack up the colored discs as fast as possible and in a certain pattern and sequence. In memory mode you program an entire sequence of movements to move the discs and won't know if it actually works until you RUN the program. Finally there is a 1 or 2 player bingo mode in which you align different columns and rows to BINGO and activate rob commands. An opponent will also hop around activating commands. Your goal is to have R.O.B. move as many of the colored discs without dropping them.</plot>

				<title_clean>Star Luster</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Star Luster is a space sim/shoot-em-up for the Arcade and Nintendo Famicom (and much later, the Sharp X68000) that uses the Star Raiders model of having everything viewed first-person from the cockpit, and having to manually select which region of space to visit next and travel there by hyperspace. The goal is to intercept the "E"s on the starmap, which stands for "Enemies". The player can also visit friendly space stations (represented as "B"s, for "Base") to refuel and repair damage. The player can also opt to use one of their limited torpedoes to target an enemy region remotely, though this tactic must be used sparingly.[CR]In combat, the player must roll, pitch and yaw their craft to center the enemies on their screen before shooting them down. The player's map changes to a radar in order to help them search for enemies easier. Enemy attacks can also damage the player's ship, but they have to break through a regenerating shield before any permanent damage can be done. It is possible for the player to lose access to their radar and other computer systems after receiving heavy damage, in which case they must return to a base for repairs before they can be used again.[CR]Unlike Namco's previous games for the system, which were ports of their Arcade hits, Star Luster was the first to be created specifically for the Famicom. The Arcade version was released slightly later the same year (1985) with a graphically-enhanced Sharp X68000 version released almost a decade later in 1994.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Color Selection[CR]After the title screen stops scrolling and the name starts flashing, quickly press Select, B, A, Right, Left, Up, Select, B, Down &amp; Right before it stops flashing. If done right, you'll go to a Color selection screen for your ship and text.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hidden Ship Repair[CR]There is a way to repair your ship without docking at a base. If you are very low on energy, and any of your systems are on "NG" status, hold A + B on the second player's controller, and use the microphone. If done correctly, a shuttle will appear and repair your ship as usual. This only works once per game.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Originally intended to be a sequel to Star Force, it was re-named Star Soldier due to a change in Hudson's relationship with Tecmo. It has received many upgraded remakes on various platforms. The series was hugely popular in Japan at the time, but never attracted the same popularity overseas. It was the contest game at Hudson's "2nd National TDK Famicom Caravan" in 1986 and remained popular and made frequent appearances at the Caravan while it was still being held; there was even a movie produced by Toho detailing the battle between the two top competitors, one of them being the famous Toshiyuki Takahashi.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A "Big Star Brain".[CR]The game features 16 stages; at the end of each stage is a boss called a "Star Brain" which must be destroyed; if the player cannot destroy a Star Brain within a certain period of time, they are returned to a midway point in the stage and must try again.[CR]The player ship (called Caesar) has 4 levels of shot power. Level 1 is a basic shot; level 2 allows Caesar to move and shoot faster. Level 3 results in a change in the appearance of Caesar and a "rear-fire" ability. Level 4 grants Caesar a barrier which protects from enemy bullets and allows Caesar to shoot rapidly in 5 directions! Caesar also becomes temporarily invincible. The music changes when the player reaches level 3, and remains changed until the player loses this level of power. There are several other variations on this which are triggered by other conditions (I.E., losing the barrier downgrades Caesar to a three way shot) There are also various hidden power-ups throughout the game, often triggered by being able to shoot an object a certain number of times in a second. As another unusual feature, it is possible to hide under some pieces of the terrain: The player cannot be hit while doing this, but they cannot shoot either. This feature, while interesting, can lead to some degree of confusion.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Lazarus.Melth: Resembling a red water beetle, these are the first enemy encountered. They approach in a zig-zagging pattern, but are very weak. Worth 100 points.Tyula: Spherical enemies that approach from the top, move in an arc, and exit again. 100 points.Riad: A tyula with a slightly different arc. 100 points.Jella: Disembodied flying wasp heads that sometimes shoot at the player. 100 points.Pring: Prings bounce downwards, much like their namesake the spring. They are of little threat. 100 points.Deida: Oddly shaped enemies that gyrate towards the player in an odd way. 100 points.Kalgo: Space snails the enter, shoot bullets wildly in all directions, and leave. 100 points.Atolis: Fast moving ships that are easily destroyed. 100 points.Bataf: Simple space butterflies that fly in various arcs. They sometimes will fly in lines, depending on where the player is. 100 points.Temis: Non-threatening wasps which enter from the sides. 100 points.Meeba: Amoebas that move slowly and come in groups. 100 points.Stellia: They enter from the top of the screen and fire at the player. 100 points.Reus: Saucer-type enemies that like to enter from the lower right or left corners, and then fly in a large arc in front of the player. 100 points.Rudan: Ships that gather in the center of the screen and then move off slowly. 100 points.Yaar: Fast moving dragonflies that fly in formation. 200 points.Prizun: Yellow ships which enter from the left side of the screen and sometimes shoot at the player. 200 points.Ruid: Another saucer-type, these turn in to sopplers when destroyed. 200 points.Kadeath: Yellow butterflies that zigzag fairly quickly. 200 points.Beeg: Disembodied flying bee heads that are fairly durable and shoot at the player. They can be a nuisance. 200 points.Solel: Blue ships that maneuver back and forth while advancing slowly and shooting at the player. Fairly durable. 200 points.Guha: They charge to the center of the screen, slow down, then charge away again. 200 points.Drak: Red shrimp that enter from the bottom of the screen slowly, then rapidly charge at the player. 300 points.Ache: Tadpoles that enter from the lower left and fly to the upper right at high speed. They often approach at difficult to hit angles. 300 points.Ri-de: Blue discs which appear in large numbers and shoot at the player. Relatively slow moving. 300 points.Pendo: Ships that fly in, break formation in various manners, then leave again. They are surprisingly threatening. 300 points.Slant: Extremely fast moving enemies which can enter from anywhere; they often simply try to collide with the player. 400 points.Patra: Enemies that try to attack the player from the side, on Caesar's blind spots. Quite menacing! 400 points.Soppler: Essentially a projectile, these are formed when ruids are destroyed; they are also fired by star brains. They are indestructible.Lazarus: A stone head which assembles itself after 4 pieces enter the screen from the corners. Worth 1000 points, but if the player can destroy one before it assembles they get an 80,000 point bonus!Jericho: A giant mechanical eye that shoots bullets rapidly in all directions. 1000 points.Star Brain: A star brain, regular sized. They shoot bullets and sopplers at the player. Worth 5000 points.Big Star Brain: A star brain... super sized! Similar to a regular star brain, but they're so big it's difficult to maneuver! The big star brain also has multiple parts: Each part is worth 5000 points.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Change Graphics (Japanese version)[CR]This cheat will work only if the Famicom's internal microphone is triggered on by loud voice.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]This game is based entirely on the first Star Wars movie, Episode IV: A New Hope. The opening of the game features an animated cinematic of the opening scene of the film. After that the player takes control of  Luke Skywalker, driving the  landspeeder across  Tatooine in search of  R2-D2.   Luke Skywalker explores various locations throughout Tatooine, fighting numerous enemies including Jawas and Stormtroopers. The game features many locations from the movie including the Chalmun's Cantina in Mos Eisley where Luke meets Han Solo for the first time. This section of the game features a classic 8-bit rendition of the "Cantina Band" theme as played by the fictitious band, Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes, in the feature film. The game also contains many famous lines from the movie including Obi-Wan Kenobi's plea to Luke to join him in his trip to Alderann and Han Solo's description of the smell from the Death Star's trash compactor.   The player eventually lands on the  Death Star and has to destroy the tractor beam to escape. The game also features first person segments of piloting the  Millenium Falcon through that Asteroid field that was once  Alderaan, and shooting down  Tie Fighters in both the Millenium Falcon and an  X-Wing fighter. The finale of the game features a top down view of Luke Skywalker's X-Wing flying through the Death Star trenches. After the player successfully fires a torpedo into the Death Star's exposed exhaust port, a cinematic of the Death Star exploding and Luke Skywalker being awarded a medal on Yavin IV is shown. The game featured the characters Luke Skywalker,  Han Solo,  Obi-Wan Kenobi,  Princess Leia, R2-D2, and C-3PO. The game however does not feature  Darth Vader or  Chewbacca, both of whom are major characters in the film.[CR]</plot>

You play as Luke Skywalker, and using your blaster, lightsaber and force power skills, you must journey through Hoth, Echo Base, Dagobah, Bespin and Cloud City. Enemies such as Darth Vader and Boba Fett will appear along the way, while R2, Yoda and Obi-Wan appear to give you tips on enemy weakness. Also keep and eye out for things you won't see in the movie, such as trying to beat Slave 1 (Boba Fett's ship) and fighting Cloud Cars.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]At the message "A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away", press Left &amp; Select at the same time.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sukeban Deka III is based on the Sukeban Deka manga and anime license. Specifically, it is based on the third TV series (hence the "III", as this game is not the sequel to anything), which involves three sisters taking up the mantle of the Sukeban Deka (Female Delinquent Cop) and fighting crime.[CR]The player can switch between the three sisters at any time, and is automatically prompted to do so should they ever lose a life. Each fights with a different weapon: The eldest, and default, sister Yuka fights with metallic origami cranes; the middle sister, Yuma, fights with yarn needles; and the youngest, Yui, fights with the Sukeban Deka's trademark steel yo-yo.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Summer Carnival '92 - Recca</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Recca 92 is a classic scrolling shooter set in space played from the overhead perspective. The player's ship, Recca, must navigate numerous enemy waves per stage culminating in a large boss encounter. To aid the player Recca may collect power-ups and option units that appear after defeating on screen enemies. Finally, Recca can store plasma energy by not firing its weapons. Plasma energy will build up over time indicated by a meter on the bottom of the screen. This forms a barrier in front of Recca which can absorb enemy bullets, however enemies can still collide with the player and destroy them. This energy can be launched creating a large explosion that can destroy enemy units and projectiles.Power-upsThere are five power-ups that can be equipped by Recca altering the mechanics of its shot. By picking up multiple of the same power-up in a row their power and effects will increase.Balkan - A spread shot upgrade that makes bullets fire in a wider arc.Laser - A penetrative shot upgrade that allows bullets to continue through enemies.Beam - An almost straight power upgrade to Recca's shots. Bullets travel straight forward, similar to default shots, but do more damage.5-Way - Lowers firepower but shoots bullets in five directions around Recca.Homing - Bullets will now track enemies upon being shot.Option UnitsThere are five option unites that can be equipped by Recca giving the player various types of shields that will absorb enemy bullets and provide additional firepower. By picking up multiple of the same options in a row their number will increase.Option B - Flies behind Recca and will fire backwards.Option C - Moves and faces in the opposite direction Recca is traveling.Option R - Rotates around Recca automatically.Option S - Moves and faces in the same direction Recca is traveling.Option F - Stays beside Recca's side and fires forwards.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Change Limit and Infinite Lives[CR]Change Limit: After a reset, before the title screen, some swirling text appears. Hold Select while this text fades, and a dialog saying "CHANGE LIMIT" will appear. Press Start to exit.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound Test + Odd Image[CR]To access the Sound Test menu in Recca, hold Select and press a confiramtion button at the title screen (after the Naxatsoft logo). If you get to a small menu that says ''Change Limit'', just press B and you'll go to the title screen where you'll be able to use the code.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Second part of the game.[CR]When you cleared the game, and are confronted with the "to be continued" message, don't shutdown your console! Reset it, and you'll start the amazing second part of the game, featuring new levels even harder than the first ones.</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Arabian</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The player controls the Arabian who must jump his way through a variety of environments in order to save the princess that has been captured by a band of crows. The only way he can safely make it though each level is to collect the letters hidden in different vases. Once he does that he may proceed to the next level.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]This is pretty much a exact copy of the game Donkey Kong with a different theme. This means the Arabian can only jump over enemies rather than attack them directly and has to evade a lot in order to collect the vases scattered around each level. Each environment has a different type of object that he can climb: For instance, in the first level he has to scale the poles of the ship in order to collect everything. On level 3 he will also have to deal with flying carpets that he must scale to reach all of the letters. Once he gets past the 4 levels they will start to repeat until the player has run out of lives.EnemiesSmall Crows: They walk around the level going up and down to stop the Arabian's progress. They will periodically fly directly at him from wherever they are in the level.Pink Monsters: Most of the time they just go back and forth. But sometimes they will jump at the Arabian instead of letting him jump over them.Giant Crow: He stays the the top of the screen. Going back and forth. For whatever reason he doesn't attack the Arabian unless he runs into him.[CR]</plot>

To support his disguised forces of doom, he's recruited Jagger Froid, a demented alien from the Black Hole Galaxy. He's also shuttled in The Babula Destructoid Mechanism with its Beam of Death. With torrential terror about to rain down upon civilization, Earth's only hope rests with you, Scorpion, and your pal, the Dogster. And if your spread guns, lasers, flame throwers and mega shells fail to destroy Red Falcon's eight levels of terror, including radioactive lava fields, it's all over but for the shouting, the screaming and the cries from a disintegrating world![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 30 Live Code (Probotector II EU Version)[CR]On the title screen, press Right, Left, Down, Up, A, B, then Start.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Dyna'mix Badminton is the first game for the Famicom to cover the sport of badminton. It was created by the developer/publisher team Pax Softnica and Vap Inc., previously behind Super Real Baseball '88.[CR]The game is depicted by a side-view, more commonly associated with volleyball video games than tennis video games, the latter favoring a viewpoint from behind one of the competitors. This comparison is also true for the sport of badminton itself, which has a similar focus on performing hard-to-counter spike attacks close to the net in order to score points. Because of the irregular flight path of a shuttlecock, the player needs to focus more on its shadow than the projectile itself in order to play effectively.[CR]Though the game has options for both male and female characters every character sprite is the same androgynous black-haired person. The only real change is that games are shorter for female competitors as they would be in real life. The game also allows for four different "coats" on the main menu - as these change the venue the competitors are playing in, this is presumably a mistranslation of "courts".[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] See The Ending[CR]At the password screen, type "BOMP", hold A &amp; B on controller 2 and press Start on Controller 1.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Mario Bros. title screen.[CR]Super Mario Bros. is a fantasy platformer created by  Shigeru Miyamoto, and published by  Nintendo. The game was released in 1985 for the  Nintendo Entertainment System. Super Mario Bros. has gone on to be considered by many to be one of the best platformers ever created. The  Guinness World Records Gamer&#8217;s Edition, a record keeping organization, declared Super Mario Bros. for the NES as the  best selling video game of all time with more than 40 million copies sold worldwide.[CR]Super Mario Bros. has two direct sequels, numerous spin-offs, and has also crossed mediums--most notably into television and movies. Super Mario Bros., the movie, was the first  movie to be based on a video game.  Mario, the main character of the game, is one of Nintendo&#8217;s most recognizable mascots, and has become so famous that he is recognized worldwide.[CR]The game has been released in a variety of forms. It has been released on the  Game Boy Advance,  Super Nintendo Entertainment System,  Nintendo Entertainment System,  Wii Virtual Console, and has been featured in  Animal Crossing as a game that can be obtained through use of an  Action Replay. The game was later repackaged in  Super Mario All-Stars, along with several other early  Super Mario games.[CR]The music for the game is composed by  Koji Kondo, also well known for his compositions in games such as  The Legend of Zelda. The game's iconic "Ground Theme" has been used in dozens of games since, and it is now considered the "theme song" of the  Mario series. The game's other songs, such as the Starman theme, underwater, underground, the game over jingle, and the castle themes have also been featured in dozens of future games, not limited to the Mario series.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR] The Mushroom Kingdom is invaded by the  Koopas. The Koopas are a tribe of turtle-like creatures versed in the ways of black magic. Using their black magic abilities they have turned all the Mushroom people into various objects like stones and bricks. Their leader, the evil Koopa King  Bowser, has kidnapped the only person who can undo the black magic that has trapped the Mushroom people,  Princess Toadstool. Mario hears of the plight of the Mushroom people, grabs his brother  Luigi, and sets out on a quest to free Princess Toadstool.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay of Super Mario Bros. is simple. The game has eight worlds, and each world has four sub-levels. Basically, Mario must travel through all eight worlds, avoiding obstacles and enemies along the way. At the end of each world is a castle, in which Mario must fight one of Bowser&#8217;s evil minions; with the exception of the last castle in which Mario fights Bowser himself.Mario swims through World 2-2.[CR]There were also several chances to  Warp ahead and skip levels. World 1-2 had the ability to warp to Worlds 2, 3 or 4, and World 4-2 had the ability to warp worlds 6, 7 and 8. This allowed for the  Speedruns to become common.[CR]The weapons in Mario's arsenal are not vast by any means. Mario can  jump on enemy&#8217;s heads, shoot  fireballs (by picking up a Fire Flower) at them, or use &#8220;Star Power&#8221; by picking up a Starman, which makes him an  invincible machine of destruction, laying waste to everything in his path. Mario can also use the occasional  Koopa shell to kill enemies. This four pronged offensive is how Mario will dispatch of most enemies, with the exception of Bowser and his castle minions. When it comes to the bosses of the game there is another way of dealing with them that is presented. Jumping on their heads will only get Mario killed, and there are no Starmen to be had during these instances. They can be killed with fireballs, if Mario somehow makes it to the end of the level with with that ability; but if Mario doesn't, there aren't many other approaches to dispatching these enemies.[CR]Mario begins the game with 3 lives, and can earn more by obtaining 1-up mushrooms, collecting 100  coins, or by jumping on multiple enemies (or a single enemy multiple times) without touching the ground. It is possible to earn many lives very quickly by using exploits such as repeatedly jumping on a Koopa shell, kicking it into a block, and jumping on it again as it returns. If Mario loses all his lives, the player is returned to the start screen.[CR]All of the the bosses in the game are standing on bridges over pits of lava, blocking the way to the end of the level. At the end of each bridge is an ax. Using a platform above the boss or running underneath the boss when he jumps, and then touching the ax at the end of the bridge will cause the bridge to collapse, sending the boss into the lava below.[CR]After each one of the &#8220;boss&#8221; battles a mushroom retainer (aka  Toads) is saved who says this  famous line, &#8220;Thank you Mario! But our princess is in another castle!&#8221; The exception is, of course, when Mario finally beats Bowser in World 8-4 and rescues  Princess Peach.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR] Mario - Main character of the game. The character the player assumes when playing the game in single player mode, and the character used by player one in two player mode. Bowser - King of the Koopas and the main boss of the game. Luigi - Secondary character of the game. Mario&#8217;s brother and character used by player two when in two player mode. Mushroom Retainer (Toads) - The mushroom person that is saved in the castles at the end of each world, with the exception of the last castle. Princess Toadstool - Princess of Mushroom Kingdom and the only one who can undo the Koopa&#8217;s black magic.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR] Blooper &#8211; Underwater squid-like creatures that must be killed with fireballs. Bullet Bill &#8211; Bullets that are fired, either with a cannon, or off-screen, at Mario. Buzzy Beetle &#8211; A tough beetle-like creature with a hard, outer shell that cannot be hurt by fire. Cheep Cheep &#8211; Red and yellow fish with white undersides. Under water this enemy must be killed using fireballs. Out of water they can be killed by fireball, jumping on them, or touching them when the player possesses "Star-Power." Goomba &#8211; A small mushroom like enemy with feet that is susceptible to any of the four main attack methods. Koopa Troopa &#8211; A turtle-like enemy. Jumping on this enemy will cause it to go into its shell, and if the shell is then jumped on it will send it traveling either right or left and take out any enemies in its path. This enemy is susceptible to any of the four main attack methods. Lakitu &#8211; A koopa who rides on a cloud, showering Mario with spiny eggs. These eggs turn into Spinies (see below). Paratroopa &#8211; Basically Koopa Troopas with wings. When jumped on, they lose their wings and turn into Koopa Troopas. This enemy is susceptible to any of the four main attack methods. Spiny &#8211; These koopas are thrown by Lakitu, and come covered in spikes. They can be hurt by fireballs, or when touched by a player possessing "Star-Power."[CR]Power Ups[CR] 1-UP &#8211; A green mushroom that grants Mario an extra life. Fire Flower &#8211; Gives Mario the ability to shoot fireballs. Mario must already be in the &#8220;Super&#8221; form to gain the fireball ability; otherwise it has the same affect as the Super Mushroom. Starman &#8211; Makes Mario or Luigi invincible, with the exception of falling into holes, and grants the ability to kill enemies just by touching them. Normally Mario must jump on an enemy, shoot it with fireballs, or use a Koopa shell to kill them. Super  Mushroom &#8211; This makes Mario bigger. In essence it transforms Mario or Luigi into &#8220;Super Mario&#8221; or &#8220;Super Luigi.&#8221; It also gives them the ability to take an extra hit; however, when hit they lose the &#8220;Super,&#8221; and are reduced to regular Mario or Luigi.[CR]Notable Ports and Remakes[CR] Vs. Super Mario Bros. All Night Nippon Super Mario Bros. Super Mario Bros. Special Super Mario Bros. Deluxe Super Mario All-Stars Super Mario All-Stars &amp; Super Mario World Classic NES Series: Super Mario Bros. Super Mario Bros. / Duck Hunt Super Mario Bros. / Duck Hunt / World Class Track Meet[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]In November 1986, the Milwaukee Journal described the original NES version of Super Mario Bros as "the best video game this year".[CR]In the March 1986 issue of Computer and Video Games, Clare Edgeley gave the arcade version, Vs. Super Mario Bros, a positive review.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Super Mario Bros. (and the Nintendo Entertainment System) were released at a major turning point in video game history, shortly after the infamous video game market crash in 1983 (caused by oversaturation of the market with budget, low-quality games). Marketed as more of a toy than a "video game console," the NES was able to find its success due, in part, to Super Mario Bros., which was offered along with a purchase of a new console, rendering it one of the best selling games of all time.[CR]The game popularized the "side-scrolling platformer" genre, inspiring clones and lookalikes for several generations following its initial release. Even the NES itself found dozens upon dozens of side-scrolling platformers released for it, indicative of Super Mario Bros.'s effect on game development.[CR]Since its release, Super Mario Bros. has been regarded as one of the most influential games of all time. It is consistently placed on official "top games of all time" lists, including lists from publications such as Nintendo Power, Electronic Gaming Monthly, IGN, Screw Attack, Game Informer, and many, many more.Release Date Controversy[CR]There is minor controversy regarding the actual date of Super Mario Bros.'s release. While the game's official release date in Japan is recorded and well known, its release date in North America is highly disputed, and even the year is uncertain. Several sources cite the release date as 1986, including video game historian Steven Kent.[CR]Official Nintendo sources state the release date is October 18, 1985, which is reciprocated in  Super Smash Bros. Brawl's "Chronicle" section. Supposedly, the game was released coinciding with the release of the NES, however, its original release date is also lost. Other possible release dates include October 12, October 19, and another official Nintendo provided date of November 17, 1985.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Access 5-1 from 1-2[CR]To access this warp, you must be Super or Fiery Mario. Go to the pipe at the end of the level and jump on top of it. Jump up and break the block over top of the part of the pipe farthest left. Then, position Mario on the edge of the pipe, with one foot hanging off the edge. Duck, then jump backwards as far right as possible.  If done just right, Mario will slide through the pipe and the bricks. Walk over to the warp zone area and enter the middle pipe. This pipe will take you to world 5, level 1. The same area can be acessed from a pipe in the same place in 4-2. However, this is meant to be a warp zone to 5-1, whereas the 1-2 warp to 5-1 is a glitch. After completing the jump trick in level 1-2, you can also go down either of the other two pipes, both of which will take you to Minus World -1. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] World Select[CR]After beating the game, if you do not turn off the console, you will return to the title screen. There, you can press the B Button to start as desired in World 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Blooper Dodge[CR]If you just walk along the sea floor, Bloopers will never be able to kill you because they are forced back up just before they hit the floor(or you).</plot>

Bullet Bill &#8211; Bullets that are fired, either with a cannon, or off-screen, at Mario. Buzzy Beetle &#8211; A tough beetle-like creature with a hard, outer shell that cannot be hurt by fire. Cheep Cheep &#8211; Red and yellow fish with white undersides. Under water this enemy must be killed using fireballs. Out of water they can be killed by fireball, jumping on them, or touching them when the player possesses "Star-Power." Goomba &#8211; A small mushroom like enemy with feet that is susceptible to any of the four main attack methods. Koopa Troopa &#8211; A turtle-like enemy. Jumping on this enemy will cause it to go into its shell, and if the shell is then jumped on it will send it traveling either right or left and take out any enemies in its path. This enemy is susceptible to any of the four main attack methods. Lakitu &#8211; A koopa who rides on a cloud, showering Mario with spiny eggs. These eggs turn into Spinies (see below). Paratroopa &#8211; Basically Koopa Troopas with wings. When jumped on, they lose their wings and turn into Koopa Troopas. This enemy is susceptible to any of the four main attack methods. Spiny &#8211; These koopas are thrown by Lakitu, and come covered in spikes. They can be hurt by fireballs, or when touched by a player possessing "Star-Power."[CR]Power Ups[CR] 1-UP &#8211; A green mushroom that grants Mario an extra life. Fire Flower &#8211; Gives Mario the ability to shoot fireballs. Mario must already be in the &#8220;Super&#8221; form to gain the fireball ability; otherwise it has the same affect as the Super Mushroom. Starman &#8211; Makes Mario or Luigi invincible, with the exception of falling into holes, and grants the ability to kill enemies just by touching them. Normally Mario must jump on an enemy, shoot it with fireballs, or use a Koopa shell to kill them. Super  Mushroom &#8211; This makes Mario bigger. In essence it transforms Mario or Luigi into &#8220;Super Mario&#8221; or &#8220;Super Luigi.&#8221; It also gives them the ability to take an extra hit; however, when hit they lose the &#8220;Super,&#8221; and are reduced to regular Mario or Luigi.[CR]Notable Ports and Remakes[CR] Vs. Super Mario Bros. All Night Nippon Super Mario Bros. Super Mario Bros. Special Super Mario Bros. Deluxe Super Mario All-Stars Super Mario All-Stars &amp; Super Mario World Classic NES Series: Super Mario Bros. Super Mario Bros. / Duck Hunt Super Mario Bros. / Duck Hunt / World Class Track Meet[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]In November 1986, the Milwaukee Journal described the original NES version of Super Mario Bros as "the best video game this year".[CR]In the March 1986 issue of Computer and Video Games, Clare Edgeley gave the arcade version, Vs. Super Mario Bros, a positive review.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Super Mario Bros. (and the Nintendo Entertainment System) were released at a major turning point in video game history, shortly after the infamous video game market crash in 1983 (caused by oversaturation of the market with budget, low-quality games). Marketed as more of a toy than a "video game console," the NES was able to find its success due, in part, to Super Mario Bros., which was offered along with a purchase of a new console, rendering it one of the best selling games of all time.[CR]The game popularized the "side-scrolling platformer" genre, inspiring clones and lookalikes for several generations following its initial release. Even the NES itself found dozens upon dozens of side-scrolling platformers released for it, indicative of Super Mario Bros.'s effect on game development.[CR]Since its release, Super Mario Bros. has been regarded as one of the most influential games of all time. It is consistently placed on official "top games of all time" lists, including lists from publications such as Nintendo Power, Electronic Gaming Monthly, IGN, Screw Attack, Game Informer, and many, many more.Release Date Controversy[CR]There is minor controversy regarding the actual date of Super Mario Bros.'s release. While the game's official release date in Japan is recorded and well known, its release date in North America is highly disputed, and even the year is uncertain. Several sources cite the release date as 1986, including video game historian Steven Kent.[CR]Official Nintendo sources state the release date is October 18, 1985, which is reciprocated in  Super Smash Bros. Brawl's "Chronicle" section. Supposedly, the game was released coinciding with the release of the NES, however, its original release date is also lost. Other possible release dates include October 12, October 19, and another official Nintendo provided date of November 17, 1985.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Access 5-1 from 1-2[CR]To access this warp, you must be Super or Fiery Mario. Go to the pipe at the end of the level and jump on top of it. Jump up and break the block over top of the part of the pipe farthest left. Then, position Mario on the edge of the pipe, with one foot hanging off the edge. Duck, then jump backwards as far right as possible.  If done just right, Mario will slide through the pipe and the bricks. Walk over to the warp zone area and enter the middle pipe. This pipe will take you to world 5, level 1. The same area can be acessed from a pipe in the same place in 4-2. However, this is meant to be a warp zone to 5-1, whereas the 1-2 warp to 5-1 is a glitch. After completing the jump trick in level 1-2, you can also go down either of the other two pipes, both of which will take you to Minus World -1. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] World Select[CR]After beating the game, if you do not turn off the console, you will return to the title screen. There, you can press the B Button to start as desired in World 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Blooper Dodge[CR]If you just walk along the sea floor, Bloopers will never be able to kill you because they are forced back up just before they hit the floor(or you).</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The title screen.[CR]Released in the United States in 1990, Super Mario Bros. 3 was one of the most highly anticipated games of its time. Nintendo's promotional campaign leading up to the game's release was unprecedented for a video game in the US, and included a key role in the climactic moments of the video-game-themed movie The Wizard. While the film was universally panned by movie critics and video gamers alike, it was successful in its ulterior purpose of promoting Super Mario Bros. 3.[CR]Super Mario Bros. 3 is generally considered to be one of the Nintendo Entertainment System's best, one of the greatest Nintendo games of all time, and also one of the best Mario games ever created. It was noted for being the top selling video game of all time, before being surpassed by Wii Sports.[CR]The game's popularity has resulted in a few ports and remakes, including Super Mario All-Stars (a compilation of early Mario games), Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3, and a Virtual Console port.[CR]Shigeru Miyamoto returned as lead designer along with Takashi Tezuka, and Koji Kondo as the game's music composer.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Super Mario Bros. 3 brings back the series' traditional gameplay.[CR]The gameplay in Super Mario Bros. 3 is more akin to the original Super Mario Bros. than the deviation found in Super Mario Bros. 2. The game also expands on and introduces many new concepts, some of which stayed for future Mario titles. Notably, Super Mario Bros. 3 was the first Mario game to feature a world map, allowing the player a certain level of freedom, including the occasional opportunity to skip sections of levels.[CR]The game follows the traditional formula of Mario chasing down Bowser to rescue the kidnapped Princess Peach, though this time around Mario also has to deal with Bowser's children and their powerful airships.[CR]Because of the new world map, certain areas are blocked by Hammer Bros., which Mario must defeat (or he can put them to sleep using an item found in the game). Along with these dangerous obstacles, there are minigames found in a Toad's house. The minigames allow Mario to win items such as Super Mushrooms that can be stored in a bar at the bottom of the screen for future use in individual levels.[CR]Super Mario Bros. 3 also includes a simultaneous multiplayer mode. Player one controls Mario while player two controls Luigi, as the two traverse the game's eight worlds. Through this mode, even more minigames are accessible, including a retouched version of the original Mario Bros.[CR][B]Worlds:[/B][CR]Grass Land is the first world.Grass Land (World One) - Grass Land is a basic Mario world, featuring a mix of slightly varied Mario environments such as straightforward outdoor stages, auto-scrolling stages that take place in the air, and even an underground stage. It is the smallest world in the game, its map taking up only one screen.Desert Land (World Two) - A desert world, as the name implies. Quicksand becomes a common obstacle, and one stage takes place inside of a pyramid.Water Land (World Three) - This world takes place next to the ocean. Levels begin to take place underwater, and even levels that are not underwater usually feature water of some kind.Giant Land (World Four) - Giant Land is very similar to Grass Land. The difference is that enemies and objects are all more than twice their normal size! Even so, most of them can be destroyed with the same amount of effort.Sky Land (World Five) - The first half of sky land is also similar to Grass Land. However, the tower stage that exists at the midpoint of this level will take Mario up into the sky, which means that the latter half of this world is composed mostly of air stages.Ice Land (World Six) - Ice Land's stages are all covered in ice. Mario will slip on ice if he is not carefully controlled, making control even more important than ever.Pipe Land (World Seven) - Pipe Land's stages feature an abundance of pipes! While the environments may be similar to Grass Land, pipes are absolutely everywhere in these stages, and Piranha Plants come with them.Dark Land (World Eight) - Dark Land features many stages that are similar to the auto-scrolling airship stages that end the other worlds. It does eventually feature a few "normal" stages that resemble earlier worlds, but even these appear to take place at night. Watch out, because nearly every enemy in the game can appear at any time. At the end waits Bowser's Castle.[CR]Power-Ups[CR]Super Mario Bros. 3 brings back the old powers from the first game, and it also adds some new, more abstract upgrades.Super Mushroom[CR]The classic Super Mario Bros. item returns in Super Mario Bros. 3. It turns Mario into Super Mario, allowing him to take one more hit before he dies.Fire Flower[CR]The Fire Flower is another classic Super Mario Bros. item. It gives Mario the ability to shoot fireballs and quickly destroy enemies. If he is hurt, Mario reverts to his Super Mario stage.Raccoon SuitTanooki Suit[CR]A new item, this gives Mario the ability to fly for short periods of time. If he runs for a while and gets his P-Meter high up, Mario can soar through the sky. Pressing B makes Mario spin, which slows down his descent and hits enemies that get whacked by the raccoon tail.Frog Suit[CR]The Frog Suit is another new item, giving Mario the ability to swim faster in the water. However, he hops around on land, making him harder to control.Tanooki Suit[CR]Very similar to the Raccoon Suit, this item allows Mario to turn into a stone statue, making him invincible to enemies. In addition to that, it has all of the abilities of the Raccoon Suit.Hammer Bro. SuitHammer Bro. Suit[CR]The Hammer Bro. Suit gives Mario the ability to throw hammers. Mario can also go into the shell and protect himself from enemies.Kuribo's ShoeKuribo's Shoe[CR]A unique power-up, this allows Mario to stomp around in a giant Goomba's shoe. He is impervious to attack from below while he is in Kuribo's Shoe, like Piranha Plants. It is only available in level 5-3. The shoe has not appeared as a power up in any game since Super Mario Bros. 3Starman[CR]Another classic Super Mario Bros. power-up, this makes Mario temporarily invincible. In certain levels, Mario can string Starmen one after the other to the end of a level by hitting the right blocks along the way before running out of invincibility.Warp Whistle[CR]A rare power-up that could only be found in some areas, this lets Mario skip a world at any time, mimicking the pipe zones from the first game. Mario can only move between tiers of levels in this way, so the tiers were: Worlds 2-4, Worlds 5-7, and World 8.[CR]Bowser's Children[CR]Bowser's seven children are the bosses of each world preceding World Eight (Dark Land), in which the player faces Bowser himself. Each child is actually named after a famous musician. Each Koopa is felled after three hits.Larry Koopa[CR]Larry has no real special abilities beyond jumping high after taking two hits. He is the boss of Grass Land. It is uncertain who Larry is actually named after, but it is speculated to be Lawrence Welk, a well-known accordionist.Morton Koopa, Jr.[CR]Morton is the boss of Desert Land, and the second youngest of the Koopalings. He is loud-mouthed and hot-tempered. While his facial features (the star on his left eye) resemble those of KISS member Paul Stanley, Morton is actually named after Morton Downey, Jr. (which also explains the "Jr." in Morton's name, not insinuating that Bowser's real name is Morton).Wendy O. Koopa[CR]Wendy is the only female Koopaling, and also the only Koopaling to have completely circular magical attacks. She is the third youngest, and is often portrayed as a whiny, spoiled brat. Wendy is named after Wendy O. Williams, the singer for the band The Plasmatics.Iggy Koopa[CR]Iggy is the middle child of the Koopalings. He is considered a "genius", particularly in the cartoons, where he is twin brothers with Lemmy Koopa. His in-game representation differs from his artwork, in which he sports a rainbow mohawk. In-game, he lacks this, and only has a blonde tuft of hair. Iggy is named after the influential punk artist Iggy Pop.Roy Koopa[CR]Roy is the third oldest Koopaling. He is a bully, and enjoys seeing others' pain. He is the largest of the Koopalings, and thus, the worst at jumping. However, when he lands, he causes a ground-shaking blast, which stuns the player if they are still on the ground. Roy is based on Roy Orbison, who inspired Roy Koopa's shades.Lemmy Koopa[CR]Lemmy is the only Koopaling to ride around on a green ball. He uses this same green ball as a weapon in some cases, launching it with his magic wand. He is the second oldest of the Koopalings, and is based on Ian "Lemmy" Kilmister of the band Mot&#246;rhead.Ludwig von Koopa[CR]The oldest of the Koopa kids, Ludwig is also able to create ground-shaking blasts like Roy Koopa. Naturally, he is based on the famous composer Ludwig van Beethoven, and even has a hairstyle similar to that of the well-known German composer.[CR]TV Series[CR]The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3.[CR]In addition to the video game itself, Super Mario Bros. 3 also has a TV show and it is called The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3. The show introduced the Koopalings and it is the second Mario animated series following The Super Mario Bros. Super Show. The show was produced by Nintendo in association with DiC Entertainment and spanned a total of 26 episodes.[CR]The Wizard[CR]The game as seen in the finals of the video game tournament in The Wizard.[CR]The game also appeared in the last scene of The Wizard where Jimmy Woods competed in the final round of the video game tournament. In this scene, Jimmy, Lucas, and Mora battled in the final round where the rules was to get the most points in 10 minutes using the game. At the final 60 seconds of play, Jimmy used a Warp Whistle to give him big points and the win.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Avoid Damage From Bowser[CR]When fighting Bowser in the final level of the game, his lower half will not do damage to you. That means you can avoid damage from his ground-pound attack by ducking if you have obtained a power-up at some point, or, if Small Mario, you can walk under him and through him without sustaining damage![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 28 P-Wings[CR]Complete the game and watch the ending. Now start a new game. You got 28 P-Wings! [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Fight Bowser With No Fireballs[CR]In Bowsers castle at the end of the game, it is possible to make it so he DOES NOT SPIT FIRE AT YOU.  This trick is easy and only requires getting to world 8 with a P-wing.  First off, use your P-wing on the map before entering the Final Castle.  YOU MUST GET TO BOWSER INTACT.  If you get to the Bowser fight room and the Bricks that he smashes through are not flush with the rest of the floor, then you are in the wrong room.  Now, when you reach Bowsers room, FLY straight up and to the left.  You will be able to walk on a wall above the screen.  Drop down on the other side. You will be in another room to Fight Bowser in.  When you drop, you will be on a door that opens to the princess.  Ignore this room and DO NOT GO TOO FAR TO THE LEFT.  If you do, you will have to fight Bowser and he will still have his Fire Balls. Fly back over the wall to the first room you were in and start the Bowser fight.  He will still throw his head back and make the sound of spitting fire, but nothing will come out.   ;)</plot>

However, the tower stage that exists at the midpoint of this level will take Mario up into the sky, which means that the latter half of this world is composed mostly of air stages.Ice Land (World Six) - Ice Land's stages are all covered in ice. Mario will slip on ice if he is not carefully controlled, making control even more important than ever.Pipe Land (World Seven) - Pipe Land's stages feature an abundance of pipes! While the environments may be similar to Grass Land, pipes are absolutely everywhere in these stages, and Piranha Plants come with them.Dark Land (World Eight) - Dark Land features many stages that are similar to the auto-scrolling airship stages that end the other worlds. It does eventually feature a few "normal" stages that resemble earlier worlds, but even these appear to take place at night. Watch out, because nearly every enemy in the game can appear at any time. At the end waits Bowser's Castle.[CR]Power-Ups[CR]Super Mario Bros. 3 brings back the old powers from the first game, and it also adds some new, more abstract upgrades.Super Mushroom[CR]The classic Super Mario Bros. item returns in Super Mario Bros. 3. It turns Mario into Super Mario, allowing him to take one more hit before he dies.Fire Flower[CR]The Fire Flower is another classic Super Mario Bros. item. It gives Mario the ability to shoot fireballs and quickly destroy enemies. If he is hurt, Mario reverts to his Super Mario stage.Raccoon SuitTanooki Suit[CR]A new item, this gives Mario the ability to fly for short periods of time. If he runs for a while and gets his P-Meter high up, Mario can soar through the sky. Pressing B makes Mario spin, which slows down his descent and hits enemies that get whacked by the raccoon tail.Frog Suit[CR]The Frog Suit is another new item, giving Mario the ability to swim faster in the water. However, he hops around on land, making him harder to control.Tanooki Suit[CR]Very similar to the Raccoon Suit, this item allows Mario to turn into a stone statue, making him invincible to enemies. In addition to that, it has all of the abilities of the Raccoon Suit.Hammer Bro. SuitHammer Bro. Suit[CR]The Hammer Bro. Suit gives Mario the ability to throw hammers. Mario can also go into the shell and protect himself from enemies.Kuribo's ShoeKuribo's Shoe[CR]A unique power-up, this allows Mario to stomp around in a giant Goomba's shoe. He is impervious to attack from below while he is in Kuribo's Shoe, like Piranha Plants. It is only available in level 5-3. The shoe has not appeared as a power up in any game since Super Mario Bros. 3Starman[CR]Another classic Super Mario Bros. power-up, this makes Mario temporarily invincible. In certain levels, Mario can string Starmen one after the other to the end of a level by hitting the right blocks along the way before running out of invincibility.Warp Whistle[CR]A rare power-up that could only be found in some areas, this lets Mario skip a world at any time, mimicking the pipe zones from the first game. Mario can only move between tiers of levels in this way, so the tiers were: Worlds 2-4, Worlds 5-7, and World 8.[CR]Bowser's Children[CR]Bowser's seven children are the bosses of each world preceding World Eight (Dark Land), in which the player faces Bowser himself. Each child is actually named after a famous musician. Each Koopa is felled after three hits.Larry Koopa[CR]Larry has no real special abilities beyond jumping high after taking two hits. He is the boss of Grass Land. It is uncertain who Larry is actually named after, but it is speculated to be Lawrence Welk, a well-known accordionist.Morton Koopa, Jr.[CR]Morton is the boss of Desert Land, and the second youngest of the Koopalings. He is loud-mouthed and hot-tempered. While his facial features (the star on his left eye) resemble those of KISS member Paul Stanley, Morton is actually named after Morton Downey, Jr. (which also explains the "Jr." in Morton's name, not insinuating that Bowser's real name is Morton).Wendy O. Koopa[CR]Wendy is the only female Koopaling, and also the only Koopaling to have completely circular magical attacks. She is the third youngest, and is often portrayed as a whiny, spoiled brat. Wendy is named after Wendy O. Williams, the singer for the band The Plasmatics.Iggy Koopa[CR]Iggy is the middle child of the Koopalings. He is considered a "genius", particularly in the cartoons, where he is twin brothers with Lemmy Koopa. His in-game representation differs from his artwork, in which he sports a rainbow mohawk. In-game, he lacks this, and only has a blonde tuft of hair. Iggy is named after the influential punk artist Iggy Pop.Roy Koopa[CR]Roy is the third oldest Koopaling. He is a bully, and enjoys seeing others' pain. He is the largest of the Koopalings, and thus, the worst at jumping. However, when he lands, he causes a ground-shaking blast, which stuns the player if they are still on the ground. Roy is based on Roy Orbison, who inspired Roy Koopa's shades.Lemmy Koopa[CR]Lemmy is the only Koopaling to ride around on a green ball. He uses this same green ball as a weapon in some cases, launching it with his magic wand. He is the second oldest of the Koopalings, and is based on Ian "Lemmy" Kilmister of the band Mot&#246;rhead.Ludwig von Koopa[CR]The oldest of the Koopa kids, Ludwig is also able to create ground-shaking blasts like Roy Koopa. Naturally, he is based on the famous composer Ludwig van Beethoven, and even has a hairstyle similar to that of the well-known German composer.[CR]TV Series[CR]The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3.[CR]In addition to the video game itself, Super Mario Bros. 3 also has a TV show and it is called The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3. The show introduced the Koopalings and it is the second Mario animated series following The Super Mario Bros. Super Show. The show was produced by Nintendo in association with DiC Entertainment and spanned a total of 26 episodes.[CR]The Wizard[CR]The game as seen in the finals of the video game tournament in The Wizard.[CR]The game also appeared in the last scene of The Wizard where Jimmy Woods competed in the final round of the video game tournament. In this scene, Jimmy, Lucas, and Mora battled in the final round where the rules was to get the most points in 10 minutes using the game. At the final 60 seconds of play, Jimmy used a Warp Whistle to give him big points and the win.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Avoid Damage From Bowser[CR]When fighting Bowser in the final level of the game, his lower half will not do damage to you. That means you can avoid damage from his ground-pound attack by ducking if you have obtained a power-up at some point, or, if Small Mario, you can walk under him and through him without sustaining damage![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 28 P-Wings[CR]Complete the game and watch the ending. Now start a new game. You got 28 P-Wings! [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Fight Bowser With No Fireballs[CR]In Bowsers castle at the end of the game, it is possible to make it so he DOES NOT SPIT FIRE AT YOU.  This trick is easy and only requires getting to world 8 with a P-wing.  First off, use your P-wing on the map before entering the Final Castle.  YOU MUST GET TO BOWSER INTACT.  If you get to the Bowser fight room and the Bricks that he smashes through are not flush with the rest of the floor, then you are in the wrong room.  Now, when you reach Bowsers room, FLY straight up and to the left.  You will be able to walk on a wall above the screen.  Drop down on the other side. You will be in another room to Fight Bowser in.  When you drop, you will be on a door that opens to the princess.  Ignore this room and DO NOT GO TOO FAR TO THE LEFT.  If you do, you will have to fight Bowser and he will still have his Fire Balls. Fly back over the wall to the first room you were in and start the Bowser fight.  He will still throw his head back and make the sound of spitting fire, but nothing will come out.   ;)</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Pinball</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Pinball is a NES pinball sim, providing six inter-connected tables for the player to explore and get high scores on. The overall goal of the game is to actually find and collect certain Mahjong pieces to complete a winning hand, but the Mahjong game itself has little to do with the actual gameplay besides providing a winning condition.[CR]The game was published by Coconuts Japan, a company best known for publishing the Pachio-kun pachinko games. Pachio-kun himself makes a brief cameo on Super Pinball's title screen.The Tables[CR]The two immediate tables that the player can visit are the lower and upper screens with an automobile theme, which depict a car in the middle of a race (upper) and a pit-stop (lower). Hitting the right zones scores points and, in the case of the lower screen, provides a few ball-saving measures to help prevent an early game over. Astute players will find a route to the third screen hidden on the top screen, which will take them to a screen filled with robotic foes and a series of bonuses to find in the middle. This in turn leads to a well-hidden UFO screen and finally to a sci-fi themed "brain" screen or a Breakout-themed screen called "Complete Crush". Defeating the brain in the former and destroying all the blocks in the latter will result in the two missing mahjong tiles the player needs to win the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Control The Ball[CR]While playing, lose the ball, hold B &amp; Select until you get to shoot the ball again. Do so and the ball will become red. Press Select to stop the ball in its tracks and you can use the cross-pad in controller 2 to move it anywhere you want.</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Real Baseball '88</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Real Baseball was developed by Pax Softnica and published by Vap Inc., it was released in Japan only. It depicted a more "realistic" take on baseball when compared to its contemporaries at the time such as Pro Yakyuu Family Stadium and Moero! Pro Yakyuu (or R.B.I. Baseball and Bases Loaded, as they were known in the US), which generally involved more cartoonish characters. Unlike many baseball games, Super Real Baseball actually had the licenses needed to use official names and teams from the Nippon Professional Baseball league.[CR]Also different was how the game chose to view the wider field: While most games at this time would switch to a bird's eye view once the ball had been struck and sent flying into the outfield, Super Real Baseball kept the perspective on the same "behind the batter" eye-height level.[CR]Pax Softnica had a good reputation for sports games enthusiasts at this time due to having been behind many of Nintendo's own core sports series such as Ice Hockey. Vap's reputation was considerably less glowing as they were responsible for the risible Super Monkey Daibouken.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Sprint</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Racing Action[CR]Super Sprint is a racing game with a top down perspective. The game has only 8 circuits, but cycles through them repeatedly, for a total of 85 races. Each cycle gets progressively more difficult by the addition of new obstacles, such as oil slicks and tornadoes. Wrenches could be obtained during races, which could then be used to upgrade the player's car in-between races. Upgrading the car allowed a certain degree of customization, since the car's traction, speed, and acceleration were upgrading independently.[CR]In arcades, the game could be played by up to three human players. The arcade version was controlled with a steering wheel and foot pedal.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Infinite Continues[CR]Power the console off, press and hold A + B on controller 1, then power it on again to have unlimited continues.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Add Extra Laps[CR]When your car is about to cross the line after completing a lap, repeatedly pause and unpause your game (if you have a controller with a Slow-Mo function, enable it here) as it goes over the line.  If your timing is right, your lap counter will increase every time you unpause your game.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Star Force, like Tecmo's earlier Star Force, is a vertical-scrolling shoot-em-up. It has two elements that differentiate it from its predecessor, however: The first is that it was made originally for the NES, rather than being an Arcade conversion like Star Force. The other is the introduction of minor non-linear adventure elements, such as the ability to purchases power-ups from stores and teleport to different time periods.[CR]Super Star Force also features special areas where the player proceeds on foot, similar to other vehicle action games like Blaster Master and Ginga Denshou: Galaxy Odyssey. These sections need to be unlocked by following specific instructions hinted at by NPCs in the regular shoot-em-up levels before they can be accessed, occasionally requiring that the player backtrack to earlier levels or shoot at an unusual fixture in the stage. In each of these special areas, the player must find two special crests that unlock the path to a Time Stone, and every Time Stone from every stage needs to be found in order to complete the game.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Superman</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Superman is a 1987 NES game developed by Seika and published by Kemco. The game loosely follows the plot of the first two films in the Superman series starring Christopher Reeve. The enemies in the game are Lex Luthor and General Zod. The player is given a map of Metropolis and is told where to go in the game. Oddly though, Superman is not able to fly anywhere unless he gets a special powerup. Most of the time he has to walk, battling enemies on the way. The player starts out in the game as Clark Kent, but is able to change into Superman in a telephone booth if they have enough super powers built up. The game is played in a sidescrolling view and, like most Superman games, is of a generally poor quality.Super PowersX-Ray visionSuper FlightSuper SpinHeat VisionSuper HearingSuper Breath ISuper Breath II[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] RH- Blood Type (Japan-only)[CR]In the Japanese version, you need to enter your name and select a blood type before the game starts. Depending on selected blood type, you'll have different parameters on your character. The available blood types are RH+ A, B, O and AB - at least initially. While selecting the blood type, press Up + A + B on controller 2 and RH will change to RH-, now the whole set of blood types will be different: RH- in addition to the normal A, B, O and AB. RH-'s parameters are higher than RH+.</plot>

				<title_clean>Sweet Home</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sweet Home is a Japan-only Famicom release that was produced by Capcom and developed as a tie-in for a Japanese horror film of the same name. It is one of the earliest entries in the survival horror genre, if not the very first. The game is also one of the sources of inspiration that would influence the design of the original Resident Evil. Many elements seen in Sweet Home are also present in the latter horror title, including the isolated mansion setting, use of puzzles, and the door animations that Resident Evil used for its loading screens.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Unlike Resident Evil and other modern survivial horror titles, Sweet Home was structured as a horror-themed RPG. The characters in the player's party earn experience from winning turn-based battles and can level up. However, if a character runs out of hit points, they are killed permanently. The game features multiple endings that are dependent on how many party members survive through to the end.[CR]Each of the party members also has a unique skill that they are able to perform. The effects of all of these character-specific skills are required to progress through the game, but in the event that any character is killed, there are items that will allow other characters to use the skill of the fallen party member.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The plot of the game focuses on a team of five people that enter Lady Mamiya's mansion in order to photograph her frescoes for a documentary. However, when they step inside, the doors shut behind them and they become trapped in what they soon learn is a haunted house. The team must then work together to escape before they become victims of the angered spirits within.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Kazuo[CR]The team leader and producer of the documentary. He carries a lighter, an important item which can burn ropes and hurt some enemies.Taguchi[CR]The team's cameraman. His camera is able to decode hidden messages in the frescoes when a photo of one is taken. The camera can also damage some enemies.Akiko[CR]The team's nurse. She can heal team members with her first-aid kit.Asuka[CR]A maid. She can use her vacuum to clean dirty frescoes and clear away broken glass.Emi[CR]Emi has no stated occupation within the game, but she has a key which can open locked doors.Lady Mamiya[CR]The game's primary villain. She went insane following the death of her child and murdered other children to ensure that her child could have playmates in the afterlife.Ichirou Mamiya[CR]Lady Mamiya's husband, as well as a famous painter. He left clues scattered around the mansion.Yamamura[CR]A mysterious old man who helps the team in later sections of the game.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Sword Master</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Sword Master you play as a knight who has been summoned to defeat a evil wizard who in-turn has summoned a demon. The world consists of seven stages starting from the outskirts of a village forest to the Wizards castle.[CR]You are able to swing your sword high, medium and low, as well as being able to block high attacks and low attacks.[CR]At the end of the second stage the player is able to transform into a wizard who has a magic bolt attack. However this attack has no extra range than that of the Knight&#8217; sword and he is also unable to block.[CR]There is a experience system that will increase as you kill more enemies, once your experience bar fills you are given some extra life and your experience resets. This is a crucial part of the game as you are only given 5 credits to complete the game, however as long as you don&#8217;t turn off the system your life and experience will remain the same.[CR]A cheat code which may be helpful for players wanting to complete the game but not having to start from the beginning is a free-play cheat.[CR]At the Title Screen hold DOWN and SELECT while pressing START.[CR]If you press UP rather than down you will get access to a boss rush mode.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]First LevelBat[CR]Can be troublesome at first as they have a S pattern as they pass across the screenWolf[CR]Will sometimes do a jump attack, they move very quickly so it&#8217;s important to stay as far back as possible.Skeleton x2 (challenge boss)[CR]The skeleton is a simple mid level boss, he has the same abilities you have except his sword is shorter.Ogre (challenge boss)[CR]Probably the easiest enemy in the level, he has longer range than you but will not block. Jump in, attack then jump out and he will go down easy.Wizard (boss)[CR]The Wizard is the first boss enemy you&#8217;ll encounter and he has two attacks and can also teleport. The attacks can be blocked high and low but they do come quickly, the Wizard can also teleport on top of the player damaging him.Second LevelZombie[CR]These basic Zombies have no special abilities or attacks, they will simply keep walking towards the player.Crawling zombie[CR]Same as the regular Zombie except they will need to be killed with a low attackFlying fire ball[CR]They move in a S pattern like the Bat from Level one, but also spit fire.Floating eyeball[CR]These are more obstacles than enemies, they can't be killed and can only be jumped over or under. You will find two just before the boss that can prove troublesome to jump over if you aren't able to perform a double-jump over.Blue Knight (boss)[CR]The hardest enemy so far, he has the same abilities as yourself except his sword is longer. Jumping in and attacking along with some well timed blocks is the only way to defeat this tough enemy.[CR][B]Oddities:[/B][CR]The rear of the box has a specific point about a double-jump feature calling it &#8220;multi-jump&#8221;[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]Enter the following on the title screen:</plot>

				<title_clean>TM Network - Live in Power Bowl</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story starts on New Year's Eve in the year 1999. The player is enjoying the morning lounging around in his room generally doing nothing. After turning on his computer, he suddenly acquires information that the strategic defense satellite "Colosseum" has picked up some nuclear weapons being fired. These nuclear weapons are being fired at a rapid pace between two forces (presumably the USA and USSR). Without knowing it, World War III is breaking out in front of the player. A nuclear blast mysteriously sends the player back in time to December 22, 1989. The nuclear war will not be prevented and civilization will destroy itself unless the player can manage to get the Japanese rock band TM Network to a concert for world peace even if he has to drive a truck to get them to their destination.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Using his musical influence inspired by rock music, the player must persuade the world to declare global peace so that the nuclear war never happens. Using an interface that is utilized in visual novels and point &amp; click adventures, the player interacts with the various members of the all-male rock band and various strangers. These people include the security guard, the office lady, and normal citizens of Japan. While some action components exist in the game, TM Network: Live in Power Bowl is mostly an adventure in the vein of the classic time travel stories. However, the player must watch how much information they let out. If he tells the wrong person that he is from 1999, then the game ends with him going to prison and the world is destroyed is eventually destroyed due to World War III.

You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again.[CR]However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal. Each arrest is based on a "suspicion".[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/nes/chase-hq[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Instant Level Completion[CR]While playing, simultaneously press A, B, Down, and Start on Player 2's controller to win immediately.</plot>

				<title_clean>Takeshi no Chousenjou</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Takeshi's Challenge (Takeshi no Ch&#333;senj&#333;) is a game for the Nintendo Famicom designed by Japanese comedian Takeshi Kitano, who is better known under his alias Beat Takeshi. Unlike conventional games from that era, however, Takeshi's Challenge is infamous for its masochistic design philosophies. Indeed, the creator himself took this to heart by mentioning on the very title screen that "This game is made by a man who hates video games." As such, the game's notoriety is derived from the absurd challenges it poses to players in order to progress to the next sequence, some of which require unique uses of the Famicom hardware itself. Despite its high difficulty level and perceived mediocrity, Takeshi's Challenge sold approximately 80,000 copies in Japan and can also be bought on the Japanese Wii Virtual Console.[CR]Originally released in 1986, the game appears to have anticipated the open world, sandbox gameplay of the Grand Theft Auto series. Not only could the player roam freely across the city, but could also randomly attack pedestrians (and, much like GTA, the police chase the player character if he murders a non-player character) or punch random objects (and that includes even punching a menu). The game was considered unusual for its time, not to mention controversial because of its violent content (which may have been a reason why it was never released in the Western world at the time).[CR]The game features ridiculous challenges, including a karaoke sequence that made use of the Famicom's built-in microphone (though a button-pressing minigame was also available as an alternative) and the option to let a treasure map sit out in the sunlight, a task that requires players to set the controller down and touch nothing for a full hour. Upon finishing the game and letting it sit at its lackluster ending screen for five minutes, Beat Takeshi appears to chide players for taking his deliberately bad game so seriously.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Revive yourself[CR]If your energy gets drained, press the A and B buttons at the same time 3 times in a row. If done right, your character should get back up with full energy.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Pacific Island Password[CR]At the password screen, press Left 2 times, Down 2 times and enter the Japanese character. Then Up 1 time, Right 1 time and enter the Japanese character. Now repeat that same pair of Japanese characters 8 more times. Then for the final two characters, press Up 1 time, Left 6 times and enter the Japanese character. Right 6 times, Down 1 time and enter the Japanese character. Hit "End" to start on the Pacific Island.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Clear the screen of enemies[CR]While playing the game, you can clear the screen of enemies by just pressing Select to go to the menu screen and then exiting it. If done right, all the enemies will be gone. You can do this as many times as you wish.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Microphone substitute[CR]There are three parts in the game where you must use the Famicom's 2nd controller built-in microphone, the Pachinko Parlor, the Karaoke Bar and to reveal the map. If you don't have the microphone available, you can alternatively press Down + A at the same time on the second controller to manually switch from microphone input to controller input. That way when you are required to use the microphone, just press the A button on the second controller and that will qualify as using the microphone.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Takeshi no Sengoku Fuuunko is a board game simulation starring Japanese comedian-turned-actor "Beat" Takeshi Kitano. Similar to the Game of Life, players move around a board earning money and occasionally encountering events such as a minigame - in which the player can increase their wealth should they succeed - or a penalty. The game has a Sengoku era theme running throughout, from its samurai characters to the tattooed gambler that rolls a dice for determining how many places a player can move around the board that turn. [CR]Beat Takeshi appears frequently while the game is being played dressed in traditional Sengoku era clothing. The game is presumably in reference to the TV show Takeshi's Castle, which also starred Beat Takeshi and had a Sengoku era theme.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] CPU Gameplay[CR]Start a new "SENGOKU GAME", and when asked "How many players would you like?", choose the number of players,. Before pressing the A button on Controller 1, press and hold Up + Left + B on Controller 2. You'll be asked for another question: "How many human players would you like?", so you can select from one to four human controlled players; the rest of the players will be CPU controlled.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]One of the many Bandai anime license games for the NES, Tatakae!! Ramenman: Sakuretsu Choujin 102 Gei follows the eponymous warrior Ramenman as he attempts to track down his father's killers and bring them to justice with his many years of martial arts training.[CR]Tatakae!! Ramenman is a spin-off of the Kinnukiman franchise, known in the US as M.U.S.C.L.E.. Ramenman was among the many characters of that franchise. Though the game's title screen credits a company called Shinsei as the publisher, it was a toy company with no prior game publishing that would soon be merged with Bandai, suggesting it was used in a subsidiary role by the toy-producing giant.[CR]Notably, this game is the first true point-and-click adventure game for the system. While there had been many adventure games made for the NES, such as Portopia or Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom, they had been largely driven by menus. Ramenman is directed by using the cursor to select an area to walk to or interact with instead much like classic Sierra adventure games such as King's Quest.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Tecmo Bowl</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tecmo Bowl is an American Football game, originally released by Tecmo for arcades in 1987 and ported to the NES in 1989.[CR]Arcade Original[CR]Wildcats vs. Bulldogs (Arcade)[CR]The original arcade version was distinguished by a large two-monitor cabinet, support for up to four players, and the ability to break tackles. Only two fictional teams can be chosen: the Wildcats and the Bulldogs. The 2D graphics were also more advanced than the NES version, with the arcade original having a larger color palette and more detailed sprites.[CR]NES Port[CR]The NES version features 12 NFL franchises from the year 1989. Although they didn&#8217;t have the official NFL license to use the actual team names and logos they were able to use the names of the players on those teams due to being licensed by the NFLPA (National Football League Players Association).[CR]Though the NES version was released in 1989, the player rosters are based on actual team rosters from the 1988 season. This is probably due to the game being developed and released prior to the start 1989 NFL season, which obviously made the 1989 rosters unavailable.NY vs. Miami (NES)[CR]The franchises are as follows:[CR]Indianapolis (Colts)[CR]Washington (Redskins)[CR]Miami (Dolphins)[CR]San Francisco (49ers)[CR]Cleveland (Browns)[CR]Dallas (Cowboys)[CR]Denver (Broncos)[CR]New York (Giants)[CR]Seattle (Seahawks)[CR]Chicago (Bears)[CR]Los Angeles (Raiders)[CR]Minnesota (Vikings)[CR]The rosters of the teams are pretty much complete except the offensive lineman are not named, and a couple of defensive positions are missing giving Tecmo Bowl football nine players on each side of the ball instead of the standard eleven. It should be noted however that later copies of the game had slightly different rosters. Example: Eric Dickerson, typically the starting running back for Indianapolis, was replaced by Albert Bentley. There are others differences but not many.Game Options[CR]1 Player Game &#8211; Consists of your chosen team going through the list of other teams at random. That&#8217;s if you continue to win. One loss and you are done. The difficulty of the game gets a little harder with each team you face, which means that the computer controlled players progressively move faster.[CR]2 Player Game &#8211; One game featuring the standard vs. mode. You against a friend[CR]Coach -- This mode is like the 2 Player Game. The major difference is that it still allows each player to pick the plays, but the computer controls the football players and how the play is carried out.Gameplay[CR]Each team has four offensive plays to choose from. Most teams have 2 running plays and 2 passing plays. The exceptions being Miami and San Fransisco, they have 3 passing plays. The team on offense and the team on defense pick from those four offensive plays. Of course the team with the ball picks the play they want to run. The defense picks the play that they think the offense is going to pick, and if they choose correctly it&#8217;s an almost certain loss of yards or an interception. Once the plays are picked it goes to the field to be carried out. It plays like any other standard football game but with a couple notable exceptions. One, the defensive player only gets to control one defender the whole play, no switching to a guy that is closer. Two, if the QB throws to a receiver that is covered by either a human-controlled or computer-controlled player then it almost always results an automatic interception, even if that player is a defensive lineman. Because of this, it's important to pick/control you fastest, most talented defensive player regardless of what position he plays and always cover a receiver. The fastest, most talented defensive players on each team are easy to identify because they have the best (highest) stats. Most teams have one really good defensive player, several have more than one and a couple don't have anyone who is all that good. Sacks are not recognized in Tecmo Bowl and there aren't any fumbles, so interceptions are the only turnovers.[CR]Also, one last tidbit of information. The defensive players, and only the defensive players, have the ability to dive. Usually when you want to tackle someone the defender runs right up to the ball carrier and tries to wrestle him down. For a second or two both players tap the A button to try to either break the tackle or in the case of the defender, bring the runner down. The only draw back to this tactic is that sometimes an Offensive Lineman will come along to help the runner and instantly throw the defender, basically rendering the defender useless for the rest of the play. Using a dive tackle, if it successfully connects, instantly brings the ball carrier down. But if the dive misses then it will take a while for that player to not only get back to his feet, but also get back up to top speed. And by then the runner is long gone. As a rule of thumb, only use the a dive when you know an OL is coming for you.Field Goal/Punt Kicking[CR]Since this game is in essence a 2D side-scoller, when kicking field goals or punts, you only have to worry about power. When the meter fills to your desired level just hit the button. Simple as that.[CR]When the game was released for the Game Boy Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the scores of 8,8,6,4 saying, "...a fantastic translation of football from the programmers of one of the best sports simulations ever".[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes for Chicago Team[CR]When starting the game, select 1 Player, move cursor to Password, push A.  Use Up/Down to change the flashing digit, and Left/Right to shift into another digit.</plot>

				<title_clean>Tecmo Super Bowl</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tecmo Super Bowl is the followup to the successful Tecmo Bowl. The format roughly follows a standard game of American football, where each team has 11 players and attempts to move the ball into the opponent's end zone by using a combination of running and throwing the ball. Between possessions, the teams switch sides and the player takes on the opposite role of attempting to keep the opponent from scoring in their end zone.[CR]Tecmo Super Bowl would be remade for the SNES and Genesis platforms two years later in 1993. This version was also named Tecmo Super Bowl, and should not be mistaken for this one.[CR]Improvements[CR]Tecmo Super Bowl does not depart much from Tecmo Bowl's formula, but rather focuses on perfecting the system already laid down.[CR]Additional play mechanics include Most significantly, playbooks are expanded from four plays to eight, allowing each team to double their selection of plays before each snap. Additionally, before the game, players can customize their team's playbook to better fit their play style and team's strengths. If the defense picks the same play as the offense, they will likely cause the offensive team to lose yardage or turn over the ball, but with more plays to choose from, the likelihood of the defense picking the right play is significantly reduced. Additional new mechanics include the ability to substitute players, varying conditions of players, fumbles, and player injuries.[CR]Place kicking is modified significantly by adding the option to perform an "onside kick." By putting very little force behind the kickoff, the kicking team can attempt to steal the ball away from the receiving team, with the risk that the receiving team will have excellent field position if they manage to hold onto the ball. Additionally, players do not control how hard the kicker kicks during extra point attempts and field goals. Rather, an arrow moves back and forth to determine if the kick will be on target, as opposed to wide right or left.[CR]While Tecmo Bowl had all of the players from the National Football League, they did not have the license to use the NFL team names. With Tecmo Super Bowl, they've added the NFL team license, allowing them to use team names and colors, and the actual NFL schedule from the year appropriate to when the game came out. Some players though, like Jim Kelly, only appear as "QB Bills." Additionally, after the regular season, players that make the playoffs will then play playoff games, including conference championship games, in an attempt to get to and win the Super Bowl and take home the title of NFL Champion. One of the biggest improvements to scheduling is that players can take control of multiple teams, skip any game that they're not interested in, or let the computer play out the season for them. This feature has been copied in many football games that have come out since Tecmo Super Bowl.[CR]A Pro Bowl option was also added to Tecmo Super Bowl. This option is a feature which allows users/players to fill out All-Star rosters with whichever players they choose for both the AFC (American Football Conference) and the NFC (National Football Conference) and have them play the actual All-Star game; the Pro Bowl.[CR]Cult following and legacy[CR]In Tecmo Super Bowl tournaments, it is common to make the Buffalo Bills and L.A. Raiders off limits since both Thurman Thomas and Bo Jackson are so overpowered, they can essentially break the game because they are so fast.Tecmo Bowl tournaments still exist today, with people hacking the game and modifying teams to fit modern expansion teams with full rosters and updated logos. The most prolific tournament takes place in Madison, WI and will feature 72 players in 2010 to accommodate for its increased popularity.Tecmo Super Bowl has been adorned on many "Best Video Games of All Time" lists. These lists include a Top 100 ranking from both Electronic Gaming Monthly and IGN.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]During the starting logos or the game intro, prior to the title screen's appearance, press Down seven times on Controller 1. After doing this, you can hold Select and press A to pause the game or press B to slow down the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Nose Guard Sack Glitch[CR]While on defense, take control of the nose guard (the defensive player who lines up directly over the ball). When the ball is hiked, move the nose guard down at a 45 degree angle, then run directly right. If done correctly, this tactic will guarantee you a sack on any passing plat in which the QB goes straight backwards, which is nearly every passing play in the game with how the AI works.</plot>

				<title_clean>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is an action game based that was developed by Konami and published in North America under their Ultra Games label in 1989. Based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles license and taking cues from the 1987 animated series, it is a single-player game in which the player can switch freely between the four turtles at will.[CR]The box art to the game is taken from a reprint of Eastman &amp; Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #4 Vol. 1, which depicts all four turtles wearing red headbands. The original comics were in black and white so there was little reason to give each turtle differing colors. The full cover has Donatello swinging his Bo at an alien named the Utrom, which was used as the basis for Krang in the classic cartoon. The image was cropped so consumers who were more familiar with the cartoon would not get confused from it.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game's story begins with Shredder, Bebop, and Rocksteady having kidnapped April O'Neil. The initial motivation for the turtles is to come to her rescue, but as the game proceeds, the turtles must foil further plans including the attempting destruction of a dam and the abduction of their master, Splinter. At the game's conclusion, once Shredder is defeated and the Technodrome is destroyed, Splinter inexplicably returns to his human form without explanation, and the turtles celebrate with a pizza party.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is divided into two primary modes of gameplay. When in exterior locations, the action is seen from a high top-down overhead view. The area can be freely explored to locate entrances to buildings and sewers while fighting off or avoiding enemies. The player will eventually be able also drive the Turtle Van and use its weaponry to clear some obstacles.[CR]When inside buildings or underground, the action switches to a side-scrolling perspective with platforms and obstacles that need to be jumped on or over. The player is able to jump, duck, or attack using either the selected turtle's primary weapon or a subweapon found during exploration. Boss fights are also encountered in this perspective. Once the player has completed he primary objective of a stage, the game moves on to the next.[CR]The player can freely switch between control of any of the four turtles at any time. Each has his own health gauge, and upon running out of health is captured. Players can restore the active turtle's health by collecting pizza in the environment. If a turtle runs out of health, he is captured and must be rescued by finding him in the environment, though captured turtles are not able to be rescued until stage three. If all four turtles are captured, a game over occurs.[CR]Each turtle can attack in four directions using their signature weapons, including up and down. Donatello's attack range with his bo staff is longest, and he also swings around to hit in the opposite direction. Leonardo uses his katanas, which provide the second-largest attack range, followed by Michelangelo's nunchuks and Raphael's sais.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]The game is divided into five stages:Rescuing April from Rocksteady and Bebop.Disarming bombs placed at the dam.Using the Turtle Van to reach the center of a city.Infiltrating a Foot Clan base to acquire the Turtle Blimp.Locating and infiltrating the Technodrome.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Of the game's non-boss enemies, only the mouser and the Foot Clan soldier appeared in previous TMNT media. The rest of the game's standard enemies were created for the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra Continues[CR]Believe it or not the famous Konami Code works here as well. Though it won't give you extra lives it will give you extra continues.Just enter the following code at the title screen.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Giant Mouser boss glitch[CR]The Giant Mouser at the end of level 4 can be beaten even more easily than normal with this trick. Just stand under him and wait for his mouth to open. When his mouth opens to reveal the "weak spot", pause the game. Unpause the game, and the Mouser's mouth will be closed again, but his weak spot will be slightly visible from behind his mouth. You can now hit it to cause damage while his mouth is closed! Repeat this every time he opens his mouth for an easy victory.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy way to restore power[CR]Find a doorway that has a pizza slice or full pizza right at the beginning. Enter, grab the pizza, and exit. If you go back in the pizza will regenerate. Use this to restore power to all your turtles.</plot>

				<plot>In the era known as the Later Han, the people of China were plagued by a bandit horde called the Yellow Scarves. They searched for a hero that could amass a force strong enough to conquer these cutthroats and thieves. At that time, three men were separately gaining power by attaining the service of many Warlords. They each planned on ridding their country of the Yellow Scarves, but when that task is finished there will only be room for one Emperor. Return to a time of sword and honor, where an oath was signed in blood. Master the strategies in this role-playing game for the NES.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Fight Weaker Enemies In Caves![CR]First, get into a fight somewhere around Xu Zhou castle where the enemies are very weak. After that battle, enter the cave you want to enter without getting into anymore fights. When you are on your way to the cave, it might help to get a gullwing and maybe some smokepots. Once you get into another fight on the overworld or into any boss fight, though, the enemies are back to normal.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Get Chi Tu Ma[CR]You can find Lu Bu's horse (aka Red hare) its just past the encampment to the south of The first castle. After beating Hua Xiong there, search around the encampment on the overworld slightly to the south west of the gate. You'll find it. Whatever general has it will automatically get the benefit of an agility up spell. </plot>

Combat is controlled with a single attack button which can unleash all sorts of moves when pressed in conjunction with the directional arrows. These moves vary among each fighter, as players can choose from 15 different fighters, each with their own stats and moves, and then compete against the others to see who gets the honor of becoming grandmaster.[CR]Additionally the game includes a story mode in which players can take control of a single martial artist and roam the countryside looking for challengers (the later done from a top-down map view). Starting abilities and health are minimal, but successfully defeating opponents will increase the player's health and allow the fighter to learn new moves and turn into the ultimate combatant.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] See The Credits[CR]At the password screen, press Right 3 times, Down 4 times and enter the Japanese character.

Protect John Connor (before a 23,000 lb. tow-rig plows your Harley into tomorrow). Save humanity (while Uzi-armed SWAT teams try to blow you away). Terminate the T-1000 (steel mill metldown!)... or mankind is history.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Terra Cresta is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up from Nihon Bussan (a.k.a. Nichibutsu) and is one of their earliest games. While a fairly straightforward example of the genre at the time, it featured a few interesting design choices. The chief of which was the ability for the player's ship to enhance its firepower by collecting weapon pods: Doing this would also change the appearance of the ship, making it larger and appear more elaborate. Should the player collect the fifth and final weapon pod, the ship temporarily transforms into a fiery phoenix that is utterly invulnerable for a brief spell. Should the player get hit at any other time, they either lose the last upgrade they found or are destroyed entirely if their ship is in its least powered-up state.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>At first glance, this may just appear to be a neat little Space Harrier-type game, but actually it turns out to be a really cool neat little Space Harrier-type game. I know the screenshots are kind of confusing and don't really show much, but it really has to be seen to be appreciated.. Some of the effects are just incredible, especially for the NES. Not much to be said about the gameplay, really.. You fly around and shoot stuff. However, the tricky part is that you also have to dodge all the stuff that might kill you. That's the part that most people have trouble with, anyway. I don't know, maybe it's more complicated than that, but I never bothered to find out. I just kept hitting the B button. And that's good enough for me, dammit.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]This game has a surprising amount of story for a shooter. Fortunately everything is translated, so enjoy dammit![CR]Reviewer: Spinner 8[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/227/[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Cheat Menu[CR]At the title screen, press and hold A &amp; B and press Start. If done right, you'll enter the cheat menu. Only "Sound" is available. To enable the other options, make sure Sound is 00 and press Down to enable "Sampling". Now, set Sound to 65 and Sampling to 02 and press Down to enable "Rest", which modify your lives. Set Sound to 68, Sampling to 0B and Rest to 09 and press Down to enable "Phoenix", which gives you invincibility. Now, press and hold the Right button on Phoenix to turn it on and off rapidly, hold it until it stops changing and stays On, when that happens press Left twice to turn it Off and then On again, then hold Select and press Down. If done right, you'll enable "Stage" and "Visual", which warps you to any stage and lets you see the cutscenes.</plot>

The name Tetris is a portmanteau of the Greek prefix "tetra", which means "four", and Pajitnov's favorite sport, tennis.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Tetris challenges the player's spatial relation abilities by presenting them with different shapes made of four square blocks. The blocks are presented one at a time at the top of a rectangular play field, and quickly begin descending toward the bottom. The player can rotate the shapes and move them horizontally as they descend, and if you are able to make a complete horizontal line of blocks, that line will clear from the field. In its original form, Tetris was an endurance test, as the speed of the descending shapes would constantly increase as time went on, and the game would end when the play field filled completely with blocks.[CR]Tetris Variants[CR]A number of Tetris variations, both official and otherwise, have been released over the years, including Hatris, Welltris, Super Tetris 2, Tetris Blast and Tetris Attack. Aside from spawning its own spin-offs, Tetris has been highly influential on a large number of puzzle games released in its wake.[CR]IP Rights[CR]The rights to Tetris have been greatly disputed over the years. At one point a British software house named Andromeda was going to purchase the rights, but before the deal with Pajitnov was settled, they sold the rights to Spectrum Holobyte. Even though Andromeda's original deal with Pajitnov fell through, Spectrum Holobyte released what was essentially an unlicensed version of Tetris. After that point the rights began bouncing around, with Atari, Nintendo, the Soviet government, and other entities claiming ownership at various points.[CR]Additional Information[CR]Tetris Giant[CR]Tetris became even more popular when the game was packaged with the Nintendo Gameboy and helped sell millions of handheld systems.[CR]Sega also published a game known as Tetris Giant, the largest licensed Tetris arcade machine.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] More Choice Pieces[CR]Every time you move a piece over, the game counts it.

				<title_clean>Tetris 2 + Bombliss</title_clean>
				<plot>Tetris 2 + BomBliss is one of the many versions of the famous soviet puzzle game. There are, naturally, two variations featured on this cartridge: regular Tetris with several modes, as well as a new game called BomBliss. Also included is a two-player battle version of regular Tetris.[CR]Tetris mode includes three game types. First is A-Type, which is a standard endless mode that continually increases pace until the player loses. Next is B-Type, which is a race to 25 lines under increasingly tough conditions. Last is C-Type, which is similar to A-Type, but adds a continually-rising stack of garbage appearing from the bottom of the well.[CR]BomBliss is slightly different from regular Tetris. In each stage, the well is filled with a preset pattern of blocks and bombs. Completing a line will, unlike Tetris, not clear it. It will, however, activate any bombs within the completed line, which can then destroy the blocks. The goal is to clear the entire well of blocks.[CR]BomBliss also includes three different modes of play. Contest mode tasks the player with clearing out a preset field in as few blocks as possible; the top three scores for each stage are saved. Puzzle mode tasks the player with clearing a preset field with a preset sequence of pieces. Last, there is Construction mode, which allows the player to build their own puzzle stages.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Change Music[CR]The game doesn't present you an option to change the music, but if you pause the game while playing and then press Select, you can choose from 7 songs.</plot>

				<title_clean>Tetris 2 + Bombliss</title_clean>
				<plot>Tetris 2 + BomBliss is one of the many versions of the famous soviet puzzle game. There are, naturally, two variations featured on this cartridge: regular Tetris with several modes, as well as a new game called BomBliss. Also included is a two-player battle version of regular Tetris.[CR]Tetris mode includes three game types. First is A-Type, which is a standard endless mode that continually increases pace until the player loses. Next is B-Type, which is a race to 25 lines under increasingly tough conditions. Last is C-Type, which is similar to A-Type, but adds a continually-rising stack of garbage appearing from the bottom of the well.[CR]BomBliss is slightly different from regular Tetris. In each stage, the well is filled with a preset pattern of blocks and bombs. Completing a line will, unlike Tetris, not clear it. It will, however, activate any bombs within the completed line, which can then destroy the blocks. The goal is to clear the entire well of blocks.[CR]BomBliss also includes three different modes of play. Contest mode tasks the player with clearing out a preset field in as few blocks as possible; the top three scores for each stage are saved. Puzzle mode tasks the player with clearing a preset field with a preset sequence of pieces. Last, there is Construction mode, which allows the player to build their own puzzle stages.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Change Music[CR]The game doesn't present you an option to change the music, but if you pause the game while playing and then press Select, you can choose from 7 songs.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tetsuwan Atom, also known as Astro Boy, is a famous robotic child created by famed manga writer and artist Osamu Tezuka. This NES title is the first of a series of games based on that manga and anime.[CR]The goal of the game is to locate the thieves that broke into the home of the kindly Professor Ochanomizu and stole a considerable sum of money and return said stolen funds to the professor. Astro Boy has a series of powers in his arsenal, but is powered by uranium which steadily depletes as the game progresses. He has a basic punch and is able to triple jump and even fly in brief spurts.[CR]The game is notably odd as there are several different actions that are required to recover all the money, some of which are ambiguous and poorly conveyed to the player.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Thexder</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Thexder was created by Hibiki Godai and Satoshi Uesaka, two programmers for Japanese developer Game Arts, and released in 1985. The game was massively popular and famously went on to sell over 500,000 copies in Japan. Because of this success, publisher/developer Sierra On-Line licensed the property for release in the United States. Sierra's ported version was released in 1987, and also became a best-seller. The game sold over one million copies worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling computer games up until that time. Thexder was an important breakthrough title for the run-and-gun shooter genre, paving the way for titles such as Contra and Metal Slug.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The Thexder Assault Vehicle is a "hyper dual-armor robot-jet transformer" (which basically means it can transform between robot and fighter jet modes). Equipped with heat-seeking lasers, a special shield system, and touch controlled flight mechanisms, Thexder is the ultimate fighting machine. There is only one Thexder in existence, and the protagonist is at its control.As the game opens, Thexder becomes locked in a mysterious facility with no means of escape. The mission is to survive all 16 levels and disable the central computer, which creates the evil creatures that dwell in this forbidden world.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Each level is a massive side-scrolling map filled with obstacles, enemies, and various maze-like twists and turns. Play always begins on the far left side of the map and ends on the far right. The goal is simple: get from the beginning to the end whilst still having energy.The Thexder Assault Vehicle can transform between two modes at any time: robot and jet. In robot mode, it can fire heat-seeking lasers to destroy enemies and obstacles. Although it has the ability to jump, Thexder's robot form is generally less mobile than its jet counterpart and therefore can't access certain areas of the level. In fighter jet mode, lasers can only be fired in a straight line, making the vehicle much less useful in combat. However, the jet's increased mobility allows it to reach areas that are higher and/or smaller than the robot's larger size would otherwise allow. To be successful, players need to master the balance between these two vehicle modes.In addition to its offensive capabilities, Thexder is also equipped with an energy shield. At any time, players can choose to engage the shield by sacrificing a percentage of their current energy level. The shield provides invulnerability, but decreases with time and with each hit taken from an enemy. Completing a level without using the shield awards a sizable bonus to your "ENMAX" (the total possible energy points that are available to Thexder). Since later levels become much more difficult, it is important to have as much ENMAX as possible. Because of this, strategic use of the shield is essential for success.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Thexder is comprised of 16 levels, which become increasingly complex and/or difficult as the game goes on. The first four levels take place within some sort of ship or cargo hold, and are generally not too difficult. The next three levels (5-7) shift location to a series of underground caverns, where the enemies begin to become more difficult. Levels 8 through 12 mark a return to the earlier area, only this time the maps are significantly more maze-like and feature even tougher enemies. The final stretch features a quick return to the caverns (levels 13-15) which culminates in a confrontation with the central computer in level 16.Each level contains a number of enemies and secret areas. Enemies can do serious damage to the vehicle and should typically be avoided or destroyed. However, there are a number of special creature types which, when destroyed, award increases to Thexder's ENMAX level. These special creatures are typically hidden away in secret areas, which can be uncovered with creative use of the laser. Finding as many of these ENMAX-increasing creatures as possible is critical.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]There is no traditional "ending" to the game. Completing all 16 levels just resets the game at level 1.The title screen music is Beethoven's "Moonlight Sonata".The Tandy version of Thexder is arguably the best, as it features 16-color 320x200 resolution graphics and full 3-channel sound.The TRS-80 Color Computer version of the game only contains five levels. The size was reduced to fit onto a 32 kB ROM cartridge (instead of a 720 kB floppy disk).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Credits Screen[CR]This is a really complicated code to do, I have tested the code 3 times and it works. If you fail, you have to reset the game. Now, on the title screen, you need to input this sequence: Up, Right, Down, Left, Up, Right, Down, Left, Up, Left, Down, Right, Up, Right, Down, Left, Up, Right, Down, Left, Up, Right, Down, Left &amp; Up. But you can't just press the buttons, you have to hold a button, press and hold the next one, release the previous one, then hold the next one and release the previous one, etc, etc. For example, hold UP, then hold Right, release Up, then hold Down, release Right, then hold Left, release Down, etc.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra Energy And Harder Game[CR]This is a bit difficult to pull off. When you start the game, you begin going to the right through a narrow shaft. Notice the blue row of squares on the top of the screen. When the tip of your ship is on the 5th or 6th blue square column, hold Left to turn back and once you hit the invisible boundary, hold A for about 10 seconds. If done right, your energy will increase to 255. Sometimes, you have to hold A for less time and sometimes, you have to turn back left from a different distance. Sometimes you even get infinite energy. This game is crazy. Just keep trying different distances to turn left until you pull it off. Now, after you managed to increase your energy, press Reset and you'll start an even harder game. You'll know you did it right because everything will be green.</plot>

The Thunderbirds figure he needs the 60 days to prepare to come through with his threat so they decide to go looking for places which may contain his energy sources for his power.[CR]The game takes place over North America, the Indian Ocean, and Asia as you fly through doing different missions in each location.  As a Thunderbird, you'll  fly 5 different futuristic aircraft such as a Mach 20 Thunderbird 1 Rocket, the Neptune Hydro-Turbojet, and the Fire Flash Atomic plane.

These 3 days will be subtracted from your overall 60 days you have to beat the entire game. [CR]Your enemies consists of such exotic fare as poisonous space scorpions, mutant sea worms and even environmental adversaries such as fire spitting volcanoes. By defeating certain enemies, you aircraft can gain powerups such as replenishing delpleted heath, increased firepower, or adding orbital ships to fly by the side of your main ship to assist you in combat.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]Any time during game, hold B + Select to stop game operation.

				<title_clean>Tiger-Heli</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tiger Heli is a 1942-style vertical scrolling shooter. The game was developed by Toaplan from Japan. Tiger Heli found its way to arcades, the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Playstation One. Taito published the game in Japanese arcades; as for the NES, Acclaim and Pony Inc. distributed the game in the US and Japan respectively, and Banpresto brought it to the Playstation as part of a Toaplan collection.[CR]The gameplay is relatively simple: Shots by enemies are one-hit kills. Players have an unlimited supply of missiles that go as far as about half to three quarters of the screen length. They also have two bombs that take out all enemies in a circular area around where the bomb is dropped. These bombs could be shot and destroyed by enemy fire, but the player could replenish them by picking up the green cross power-ups. There are two other cross power-ups that give the player mini-helis that either shoot parallel or perpendicular to the heli's main fire. A red cross gives you the sideways shooting helis and white crosses shoot straight ahead.[CR]Enemies and terrain vary from tanks to other helis, and from urban settings to battle ships. The game was notorious for its high level of difficulty. Almost everything in the environment is destructible and gives the player points which will yield extra lives every 20,000 and 80,000 points.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]This is the first Shoot-Em-Up to use the smart bomb concept.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Times of Lore</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]   Times of Lore is a top down, action RPG featuring three character classes, a simple dialogue system, and a seamless world with no load times which was a triumph for the time. A quest to recover three, powerful artifacts is the main focus of the game, although the player is free to explore the land and encounter its dangers without having to follow it. It's difficulty level, action-oriented gameplay, and simple dialogue made it easy for anyone to get into. It's relative simplicity made it an ideal starting point for newcomers to the RPG genre.    The real-time action of the gameplay has also invited comparisons to    Gauntlet.  The game also has the distinction of being Chris Roberts' (of   Wing Commander fame) first title for  Origin.  [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]   The story of Times of Lore starts with the retelling of an old tale by a Grandfather to his grandchildren...  Long ago, before there ever was a High King, chaos ruled a land divided. It was then that the first of the Elden people arrived along the shore of the Great Sea. At first, the native people of the land attacked the newcomers, seeing them as a threat. After a century of war, the Kingdom of Albareth unified the land and began to prosper. The Elden earned the respect of the people that had once called them enemies and seven hundred years ago, an Elden prince was named the first High King of Albareth with the people's blessing.  He had also brought three powerful relics from the homeland of the Elden: the Tablet of Truth, the Foretelling Stones, and the Golden Medallion of Power. The Tablet allowed the king to answer any question of import to the kingdom and only an Elden of the purest blood were able to call upon it. The Warden of the Southern Marches was found worthy of keeping this great treasure.  The Foretelling Stones enabled the King to see places and times, aiding any who sought its wisdom. These the High King left with the Prior of Marabout, a great monastery built near Rhyder in the far North.  But it was the Medallion of Power that was the most sacred of these three. No High King can hold the throne without it, and its magical essence only recognizes those worthy of the title as a descendant of High King Strebor (Roberts, in reflection). The Medallion allowed the wielder to command entire armies as one force, but its strength was only as strong as the heart of the one who wore it. Therefore, only an Elden with kingly blood could bear it.  Peace reigned until the arrival of the Barbarians from the South. Ganestor was overrun and the armies of Albareth did all they could to break their march. Both armies fought each other for ten long years as High King Valwyn looked for a way to stop the bloodshed.    He then took the best of his forces and confronted the Barbarians in what would become known as the Battle of Ganestor, inflicting terrible losses on the Barbarians whose seemingly endless numbers continued to pour more soldiers into the field. It was a stalemate that neither side could break. The High King finally used the Medallion to pause the battle and parlay with Heidric, the Barbarian leader. Many days passed and at last, a treaty was hammered out.  Ganestor would go to the Barbarians, but in return, they were to swear fealty to the throne of Albareth. The two men grew to respect each other over time and in commemoration of the truce several years later, Valwyn presented Heidric with the Tablet of Truth. Heidric was also named the Warden of Ganestor and peace seemed guaranteed once again.  Valwyn was growing old and the Ten Year war had drained even more of his dwindling strength. Taking his child and the Medallion, he departed for the Elden homelands back across the sea to rest and recover his spirit, leaving the kingdom in the hands of his steward, Dariel.  Unfortunately for Albareth, Dariel proved to be less of an able ruler than Valwyn.  Many Elden lords did not agree with the truce signed with Heidric and had fostered hate for him and his people over the years since. With Valwyn gone and Dariel seen as a weak replacement, these Elden lords attacked Ganestor hoping to tear it from the grip of Heidric's son, Prince Avar.  So it is that Dariel remains as a prisoner within the city of Eralan, fearful of his enemies and unable to stop the growing chaos festering in the land. Orcs have also been sighted coming in from the North and with Albareth's own forces stretched thin, bandits freely rob travelers on the roads in between each city.   A savior was needed. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]   Starting the game presented a storybook that told the story of the kingdom of Albareth and its current troubles. Upon starting play, the character would be able to chose from one of three characters to represent them in the game:Stalwart Knight - armored and equipped with a swordFierce Valkyrie - fast and lightly armoredPowerful Barbarian - Very strong but no armor The main character was always fixed in the center of the screen and the adventure took place in both outdoor and indoor environments. Upon walking into a building or an underground area such as cave, the "top" of the area would cut away to show the player and their surroundings.  Saves were handled only at the inn after paying for a stay. This could make the game extremely difficult due to the size of the overland map and the number of dungeons on it. Dying so far from an inn would result in quite a bit of lost progress on the player's part.Unlike other traditional RPGs, there are no statistics to roll or assign in the game. There is no leveling involved. Health was represented by a candle that slowly burned down on being injured. Recovery was handled either by standing still (during which health would slowly recover) or through the use of certain potions. Item collection consisted of picking up potions, although only one of every type of potion was allowed to be carried. Money can also be gathered and used to purchase potions or better weapons.   Interacting with the environment, the interface displayed basic actions such as picking up objects, dropping them, a "look" command to examine things, and a "talk" option to engage NPCs in simple dialogue.  A day and night cycle as also integrated into the gameplay. Encounters at night were considerably more difficult than during the day. Enemies would spawn while the player was in motion.[CR]Combat[CR]The combat is in real-time with the player controlling the main character which is fixed in the center. The player would normally walk up to monsters and use the attack button to inflict damage. Monsters would drop gold, potions, or even items.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Skip[CR]Enter at the password screen</plot>

The player simply visits important people throughout Japanese history as a time-travelling cop, answering their questions and incrementally moving forwards through time towards the present. Most of the game is depicted in a first-person mode where the other person sits across from the main character, who then asks and answers questions. There are a few third-person sequences where the player must get back inside their spaceship-like time machine before it leaves.[CR]While there are a few branching paths depending on dialogue choices taken, the game's narrative is fairly linear.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tokoro-san no Mamorumo Semerumo is an action platformer that stars real-life Japanese musician/comedian/voice-actor Tokoro Jouji, a.k.a. George Tokoro. Armed with a water pistol with a finite supply of water, Toroko-san must make his way across various levels either shooting or avoiding the various enemies along the way.[CR]This game has some notoriously poor game design, such as ammo replenishing items being hidden, which means the player needs to shoot randomly to find them which simply depletes their finite ammo supply even faster. If the player takes too long in any one world, a massive vision-obscuring storm will roll in and make the game considerably more difficult to play. The game, however, does feature an early example of a non-linear stage selection progress as different paths become available after defeating each boss.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Infinite Energy[CR]At the title screen, press Up, Down, Down, B, Right, A, Left and then press and hold B and press A up to 14 times.

				<title_clean>Top Gun</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Top Gun is an air combat game for the NES produced by Konami that was released in 1987. It is very loosely based on the the 1986 Tom Cruise movie of the same name. The game later received a sequel in Top Gun: The Second Mission.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Basics:[/B][CR]Air combat in Top Gun takes place from a first-person cockpit perspective. The player has access to a standard Vulcan cannon machine gun as well as an armament of missiles. The player must take out targets by lining them up with the on-screen cross hair. Missiles also have the capability of locking on to targets.Single-Player[CR]Top Gun is comprised of four missions. Each mission consists of objectives such as destroying enemy bases and shooting down enemy fighters. The player must also remain aware of their plane's fuel level and will at times have to refuel in midair by docking with a refueling aircraft. Each mission ends with the act of landing the plane on an aircraft carrier.[CR]Intentional or not, the act of landing the plane at the end of a mission is among the most challenging aspects of the game. The player must maintain a very specific altitude and speed during the landing sequence, or else the plane will crash and the mission will end in failure.Multiplayer[CR]Top Gun can be played in a two-player split-screen competitive mode in which the sole objective is to shoot the other player out of the sky. Refueling and landing are not a part of this mode.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the GameBoy version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 4,5,4,5 adding, "...This type of game shouldn't have been attempted [on the GameBoy]. While the basics of the game's engine are impressive, overall this game just doesn't stack up. It tries to be something that is next to impossible due to the limitations of the hardware".[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Call the Refuel Plane on mission 1[CR]In an ordinary game, you can only refuel in missions 2, 3, and 4. This little trick let's you call the refuel plane on mission one. I did it with T-33 Tiger missiles, I'm not sure if it works with other types. Anyway, shoot off all your missles. When your fuel bar is down to 4 bars, press start. You'll hear the beep, and the refuel plan will come in.</plot>

				<plot>So you think you're a Top Gun hero, just because you splashed a few bogeys in the Persian Gulf. Well, before polishing your ego, you've gotta survive a second mission that's ten times more deadly than the first. Soaring against an Armageddon bound armada of planes, tanks, ships, and satellite laser beams, every ounce of your skill and courage will be drained as you fight fire with fire, while out-maneuvering anti-aircraft blasts, cannon bursts and heat seeking missiles that are looking to roast your tail.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Top Racer is a motorcycle racing game from a behind-the-bike perspective. In both these respects, it's a very similar game to Sega's Hang-On series of motorcycle racers. The player can choose from two modes: Grand Prix, in which the player partakes in several consecutive races and Touring, in which the player can choose one of four courses for a single race.[CR]The game is notable for its unusual peripheral: An inflatable motorcycle with a special handlebar controller built-in. The player can sit on the peripheral once fully inflated and use the handlebars to control the on-screen bike.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Play With Normal Controller[CR]At the title screen press A, B, Right, Down, Left, Up, Right, B, A on the second controller. See, Top Rider normally requires a special controller. However, using this code should let you use a standard NES/Famicom controller.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Special Name Passwords[CR]Enter one of these as your name during the Grand Prix mode for the specified effects.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Amagon, developed by Aicom and published by American Sammy, is a side-scrolling platformer and run-and-gun in which the player controls a particularly fragile marine by the name of Amagon. He is stranded on an island when his plane crashes down and must make his way across to where a boat can be found. Between him and the boat are all the island's hostile inhabitants.[CR]Amagon was originally released in Japan as Totsuzen! Macho Man and that version was published by Vic Tokai instead.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Amagon must make his way to the end of the stage and defeat a boss before moving onto the next. The player must keep track of their ammo: This is Amagon's only means of attack and should his ammunition run out he will be unable to attack enemies.[CR]Amagon can upgrade his strength after collecting enough points - either from defeating enemies or collecting items - and a special Megagon Key power-up. Hitting Select when these conditions are met turns him into Megagon, a considerably more powerful alter ego. Megagon can take several hits and has a powerful wave beam attack that also drops his health. When Megagon runs out of health he simply reverts back to Amagon's weaker form.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Select[CR]Start game play and reach level 4. A level select and continue option will now be enabled. Note: This option will disappear if you select to play levels 1 through 3 and lose before returning to level 4.</plot>

The game works like any other tournament-based fighter: The player character must fight a series of increasingly difficult opponents until they reach the top and are declared Yokozuna: The highest rank of Sumo.[CR]The Tsuppari Oozumou series would later see a PC Engine graphically-enhanced remake and a Super Famicom sequel. There is also a Wii Shop reimagining of sorts.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player has two moves at their disposal: A shove attack that will send an unprepared opponent reeling backwards and a grapple move that will wear down the opponent's stamina. With the judicious use of both attacks, the player must move the opponent to the edge of the ring and then find a way to push them out after draining their stamina.[CR]Between matches the player can take part in training exercises, such as eating a lot of rice, in order to refill and increase the player character's stamina bar.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Play As Professional Sumo Wrestler Nine Mountains[CR]At the password screen enter the following Japanese characters.

Occasionally, you may find hostages when a building is destroyed; try to rescue as many of the hostages as you can to earn extra points. Your helicopter has the ability to pick up extra weapons. After destroying certain enemies, a power up will be left behind which can give you one of four different types of firepower (the regular machine gun, canon, two way fire, or missiles). Other power ups that can be found include bombs (which can be used to destroy everything on the screen), extra speed, and weapon power up (increases the capabilities of whatever type of weapon you currently have).</plot>

				<title_clean>TwinBee</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]TwinBee is a 1985 shoot 'em up that, after originally being released to arcade, was released on numerous platforms including the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the first game in the Twinbee series of games that includes both shoot 'em ups and platformers. It has been rereleased most recently as a "3D Classics" title for the Nintendo 3DS.[CR]TwinBee is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up that is unlike any others during the time. Instead of "gritty" alien and military plane shooters, Konami decided to make a very cutesy shoot 'em up that retains all of the fun of others in its genre, but paints it with a thick coat of famed Japanese cuteness.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]TwinBee has fairly typically shoot 'em up gameplay. The player is in an anthropomorphic ship named Twinbee, scrollings upwards and shooting enemies. It is all in the visual design of the game that makes it different. The game has very bright colors and everything is designed in a very cartoony manner.[CR]Levels are structured in a standard shoot 'em up manner. The player flies through an area and at the end has to fight a larger boss ship.[CR]TwinBee features multiplayer co-op in which the second player commands a pink ship named Winbee.AbilitiesHealth: Twinbee can be hit up to two times. The first time he is hit he loses his wings, moves slower and can not use his ground attack.Aerial Attack: Mash the primary button and Twinbee will shoot pellets forward that will damage enemies. This is Twinbee's main weapon.Ground Attack: Perhaps the primary original feature to this game is the separation of aerial and ground attacks. Twinbee's primary attack only does damage to air. If he is being fired at by an enemy on the ground the player can toss a bomb towards the ground that will destroy whatever baddie is shooting from there. When Twinbee attacks the ground a crosshair shows up that shows where the attack will go. If Twinbee is within reasonable distance of an enemy then he will automatically aim for that enemy so that the player doesn't have to worry about perfectly aiming the ground atacks.Collectibles[CR]There are a number of collectibles in TwinBee that will either give the player points or power up Twinbee.Fruit and Pellets: Twinbee can collect both various kinds of fruit and pellets to simply give the player some extra points.Bells: Bells can be found by destroying enemies or shooting clouds. When a bell appears it floats towards the bottom of the screen and Twinbee can either collect it or shoot it to juggle it. Juggling the bell awards more points to the player once the bell is actually collected.Twinbee Orbs: These items that resemble a fatter version of Twinbee cause Twinbee to bloat then shoot out the orb a second later. The orb inflicts a large amount of damage on enemies.Bells[CR]Throughout TwinBee, while juggling the bells awards points, they can also be hit to change their color between a flashing red, pale blue, and white. Collecting these bells during this event causes different power-ups to be applied to the ship.Flashing Red: This power-up adds an extra two ships that follow Twinbee and fire an identical stream of bullets like the Original Twinbee.White: When collecting a white bell, the power-up changes Twinbee's weapon to a smaller white dot that builds every time Twinbee collects another White bell.Pale Blue: Pale Blue bell's enhances the ship's speed, stacking as more are collected. These are the most common bell.Enemy Bell: Sometimes the bell will turn into an enemy and the player needs to be careful when attempting to collect. Simply shooting this enemy once will destroy it and provide points.[CR]Be careful, hitting a bell too many times can destroy it and lose any points that could be earned.EnemiesTwinbee fights some ornery radishes.[CR]Throughout the game Twinbee fights a number of regular household objects including flying vegetables and flying kitchen utensils. The basic ground enemy resembles an animated pine cone. Twinbee has to fight boss enemies at the end of each level that often look more like a airplane/spaceship.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 5 Lives (2 Player Mode)[CR]At the title screen, start a 2 Players game. While on the black screen, with the "Today's Score", hold B and press Up, Down, Left, Right on controller 2.

				<plot>The Untouchables is based on the 1987 film by Brian De Palma and works to correspond to the movie's plot outline. In 1920s Chicago, Eliot Ness and his small crew of law enforcement professionals are determined to bring down Al Capone and his gang. [CR]The game features 7 levels of action named The Street, The Warehouse, The Bridge, The Alleys, The Train station, The Hostage, and The Rooftop. Some of the levels feature traditional jumping and shooting action. Other levels pit you against the gangsters in a first person shooter-style of gameplay where your character begins behind a wall, wraps around into an open area, and must take out the bad guys. When your character runs out of ammo, he slips back behind the wall to reload. These levels are accompanied with time limits and goals for the number of enemies you must kill.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Skip[CR]To enable level skipping, you first need to get a highscore and write down name as "XVQ". You'll be sent back to the title screen, press Start and on the stage number screen, press Up, A &amp; B at the same time. You'll be sent back to the title screen again, press Start and you'll see you skipped a level. Press Up, A &amp; B again to keep increasing levels.</plot>

				<title_clean>Urban Champion</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Urban Champion is an NES game released in 1986. Developed and published by Nintendo, it is an early entry in the one-on-one fighting game genre.  The game has since been re-released in various forms on platforms including the Game Boy Advance and 3DS, with the 3DS receiving a special remake as part of Nintendo's downloadable 3D Classics series developed by Arika. Elements of Urban Champion are also used in the Nintendo minigame challenge collection NES Remix.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Basic FightingGettin' rowdy at the SNACK BAR.Urban Champion is a one-on-one fighting game on a 2D plane. It can be played in a single-player mode against the computer, or two-players can face off against each other.The two fighters each have the ability to throw high and low punches, with light and heavy variants. Heavy punches are more powerful than light punches, but also take longer to deliver. Each player also has a stamina meter, which depletes as the player fights. If a character completely runs out of stamina, then they will become exhausted and unable to fight back for a short period of time.ObjectiveEach punch that connects sends the struck fighter backwards. If a fighter is knocked off the edge of the sidewalk, he will tumble to the next sidewalk. If a fighter is knocked to a third sidewalk, the next loss will send him tumbling down a manhole and lose the match.Environmental HazardsLocal residents will occasionally lean out of the buildings the characters are fighting in front of to pelt them with flower pots. If a fighter is struck by a falling pot, he will be left tempoarily dazed and lose a portion of his stamina. Periodically, a police car will cruise by, causing the fighters to retreat to opposite ends of the sidewalk to avoid suspicion. If time runs out, the player closest to the edge of the pavement will be arrested, giving his opponent an automatic victory.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Turn off the music[CR]While playing, rapidly pause and unpause the game 2 times in a row to disable the music. To turn it back on, pause the game, wait a couple of seconds and then unpause.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Valkyrie no Bouken: Toki no Kagi Densetsu ("Valkyrie's Adventure: The Legend of the Key of Time") is a top-down action-adventure game with RPG elements. The player, as the warrior from heaven Valkyrie, must defeat the evil lord Zouna and restore peace and order to Marvel Land.[CR]The game plays similarly to that of The Legend of Zelda, which was released seven months prior, and could be considered one of the first games to follow in its incredibly popular footsteps. It also has a few elements from Japanese RPGs such as Dragon Quest. Players explore Marvel Land on a scrolling overworld, finding money and equipment to make Valkyrie more formidable. Valkyrie also earns experience from defeating monsters, which will eventually level her up and make her stronger, as well as give her access to powerful magic spells.[CR]Though it borrows a lot from its influences, it itself has also influenced other games: For instance, persistent negative status effects that continue to harm after a battle is over, tents that restore the party's HP/MP on the overworld and using a boat to explore more of the world are all common console RPG elements that were first seen in Valkyrie no Bouken.[CR]The game's Arcade and TurboGrafx-16 sequel, Valkyrie no Densetsu, would prove to be considerably more popular. The character of Valkyrie makes cameo appearances in many other Namco properties, most frequently in their Tales RPG series.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Suicide[CR]To commit suicide, pause gameplay and then press A and B simultaneously on Controller 2.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Last Password[CR]With this password, the last dungeon will be accessible.</plot>

				<title_clean>Wagyan Land</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wagyan Land was developed by Now Production and published by Namco, and it was released only in Japan on Feburary 9, 1989. The player plays as a dinosaur named Wagyan who is on a quest to save the people of Wagyan Land from Dr. Devil. The game is primarily a side-scrolling platforming game where Wagyan must avoid enemies and make it to the end of each stage. Most stages feature a boss at the end where Wagyan must defeat them in a card minigame in order to move on to the next stage. There are also hidden warps hidden throughout the stages that can transport Wagyan to a later stage. The game spawned several sequels including two other games for the Famicom, three games for the Super Famicom, one mobile game, and one game for the Nintendo DS.[CR]Wagyan Land would eventually receive a Japan-only 2008 re-release on the Wii's Virtual Console.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Along the way there are several enemies trying to prevent Wagyan from proceeding. Wagyan has the ability to roar at enemies which can temporarily stun enemies but it cannot kill them, there are also small Wagyan powerups that can be picked up to make his roar cover a wider radius and stun enemies for longer periods of time. Once Wagyan picks up four of these powerups he will become temporarily invincible, be able to move quicker, and kill enemies on contact. Later on in the game Wagyan will receive a powerup that gives him the ability to kill enemies with his roar attack.Boss battles are really just card minigames[CR]The boss battles are unconventional; the bosses will challenge Wagyan to one of two different types of mini-games. The first type of mini-game is a word chain game, known in Japan as shiritori ("taking the end"). In this game there are 24 cards laid across the screen, the boss will pick a card with a picture on it and say what the card is. Then the player must pick a card where the first kana matches the last kana of the card the boss picked. This goes back and forth until there is no card that can match the last kana of the last card picked, the player wins if the boss can't find a card. On the other hand, the boss wins if either the player can't find a match or the player runs out of time. The second type of mini-game is a simple memory game where 24 cards are laid faced down across the screen and the player must find matching pairs. If the player finds a pair they get to go again, but if they don't the boss gets to go and the same rules apply for the boss. The player with the most pairs at the end wins. If the player loses to the boss they go back to the beginning of the stage.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Ending[CR]At the title screen, press Up, Down, Right, Right, A, B, Left, Left, Down, Up, B &amp; A. If done right, you'll watch the ending.</plot>

				<title_clean>Wagyan Land 2</title_clean>
				<plot>Wagyan Land 2 plays pretty much identically to the first Wagyan Land. You're a cute green lizard dinosaur thing, and you walk to the right and shoot various syllables out of your mouth, which don't actually hurt enemies. They just remain frozen for a certain period of time, depending on how powered-up your attack is. Once you get four power-ups you become invincible, and you can finally kill the damned things. Which doesn't happen often.[CR]So, how can you defeat the bosses with a crappy syllable that can't hurt anybody? Why you play minigames with them, of course! The whole game's pretty frustrating, with the whole "one-hit-and-you-start-the-entire-level-over" thing that's so popular in the world of videogaming. Honestly, it's fun and all, but I don't understand why the game needed to have two sequels.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]While this isn't iquite/i as polished as a href="http://www.spoony-bard.com/alanmidas/" target="_blank"Midas/a's translation of the first Wagyan Land game (the title screen, for instance, and the GYA syllables that he shoots out are left in Japanese), it's still all in English, and pretty fun to play. You can just pretend those projectiles are magical, uh, runes, or something.[CR]Reviewer: Spinner 8[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/635/[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Wild Gunman</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR]Early arcade game[CR]The original version of Wild Gunman was one of Nintendo's early electronic arcade games created by Gunpei Yokoi and released in 1974. Like Sega's 1969 arcade game Duck Hunt, Wild Gunman was a first-person light-gun shooter, yet was not a true video game, but rather an electro-mechanical arcade game that used rear image projection on the screen. This gave it the appearance of a video game, but it was more sophisticated than what was possible in video games at the time, incorporating full-motion video as well as voice acting for the first time in the arcades and anticipating the cinematic laserdisc games of the 1980s.[CR]The game consisted of a light gun connected to a 16mm film projection screen. Full-motion video footage of a Wild West gunslinger was projected onto the screen and when his eyes flashed, the player needed to draw and shoot, much like a quick time event. If the player was fast enough, the projection would change to that of the shot gunman falling down, otherwise it would show the gunman drawing and firing his gun. If the player won, then they would face off against several more gunslinger opponents.[CR]The second version of the game had a plastic gunman figure mounted on top of a plastic battery box called Custom Gunman, which later became one of the microgames in the Game Boy Advance title, WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgame$![CR]Later video game[CR]An updated video game version of the game, replacing photographic images and live-action video footage with cartoon-style video game sprites, was released for Family Computer in 1984 and the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. This version is by far more widely known than its 1974 ancestor.[CR]In this version the player also waited for the opponent's eyes to flash (accompanied by a speech bubble reading "FIRE!!") before shooting. This was the first NES game that used voice synthesis. It also featured a shooting gallery where opponents had to be shot from the windows of a saloon. A piece of Chopin's "Funeral March" indicates the player's defeat.[CR]Fun facts[CR]This game makes an appearance as a microgame in Warioware Inc.: Mega Microgames$!The game is featured in the 1989 movie Back to the Future Part II as an arcade cabinet. The game was never actually released in arcades and a specialized Wild Gunman arcade cabinet was made just for the movie. There was however, an earlier version that was released in arcades.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Willow was developed by       Mindscape (computer versions) and      Capcom (Arcade and NES versions). The home computer, Arcade, and NES versions are all quite different from each other. All three are based on the movie from 1988 of the same name.[CR]Computer Versions[CR]The home computer version of the game (Atari ST, Amiga, and PC) were the  first versions released. This game is split into five different gameplay  sections.The first section is a first person perspective maze.  First Person Maze The second section is another one from a first person perspective, this time around the player is sliding down an ice tunnel and must choose various paths along the way. First Person Ice Tunnel The third section is a top down perspective one where the goal is to avoid oncoming enemy attacks.  Top Down Stage The fourth section is a side scrolling scene where the goal is to reach  the end while avoiding oncoming attacks and defeating the enemies. Side Scrolling Stage The fifth and final stage is one where a spell must be cast on a rat using the correct rune symbols. Spell Casting Stage [CR]NES Version[CR]The NES version of Willow plays much more like a traditional RPG. Willow for the NES deviates quite a bit from the movie, but still uses many of the same characters. Plot Speaking with the High Aldwin.There are two different spirits that watch over the world, the Spirit of the Sky and the Spirit of the Earth.

				<title_clean>Wily &amp; Right no Rockboard - That's Paradise</title_clean>
				<plot>Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard: That's Paradise is a boardgame adaptation of the Rock Man (Mega Man) series of games. It plays somewhat similar to Monopoly in that there are the buying and selling of properties and construction of "labs", however RockBoard remains it's own unique game. Between 2 and 4 players can play, being controlled either by human players or the computer.[CR]Choosing the number of players and one of five characters: Dr. Wily, Dr. Right, Dr. Cossack, Kalinka and Roll, players must select which of four different boards to play. Upon starting, players begin each turn by rolling the dice and moving to the appropriate position on the board. Different squares on the board trigger events which can include receiving special cards, betting on hardhat races and random events. Players typically go around and around the board, collecting money every time they pass or land on the "E Canister" start square. Some boards feature different paths for the player to choose. Players landing on property are given the opportunity to buy it or pay rent to the player that owns it. Additionally, players can elect to build a lab on the property, even if they themselves don't own it. Thus it is possible to have separate owners for the property and lab. In those cases, rent is split between the two parties. Rent becomes more expensive when it is situated next to owners of the same kind. Thus, a line of labs or a line of properties owned by the same player will connect to each other and make the rent more expensive on each. Each property can only be bought once, however labs can be upgraded through four different phases, which is done only when the player lands on the property or activates a special bonus event. Players can also "take over" a lab or property from a player at any time, however the cost in doing so is more expensive than obtaining the property from the bank. Players can use cards they have collected at the beginning of each turn, each with it's own unique effects. Additionally many boards feature a "Robot Transform" square that will change the player into one of Dr. Wily's robot masters for one complete rotation around the board. Transformations include Guts Man who will destroy labs he lands on, Shadow Man who will steal other player's cards and Dust Man who will steal the rent of properties he lands on.[CR]Each board has a specific objective in amount of money, property and labs required to win. The first player who reaches this amount ends the game. Rankings are then displayed for all players.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] See the credits[CR]To see the game's super secret credits you need to play the last map (Megalopolis) in Battle Royale Mode, change the goal to the absolute maximum (so you don't win before the process ends), achieve over 70% on property ownerships (thanks ugetab) and make all the other players go bankrupt. After owning most of the map, making them go bankrupt will not be too hard. If you did it correctly, you should see the elusive credits after the closing ceremonies!</plot>

				<plot>Did you ever watch Tron? Thought the Light Cycle scene was really cool? Well, this game is very similar to that, only with a few tweaks and one of the most abysmally bad storylines I've ever seen.[CR]The gameplay itself isn't bad; it's actually pretty fun. Like in Tron, the goal is to get your opponent to cross either the line you leave behind when you move, or to cross over their own line. However, unlike those lame Light Cycles, you can actually jump over a line or two in this game, a maneuver that will save your ass quite frequently. The difficulty isn't too bad, since most of your opponents will fall for the same trick over and over again, but environmental effects like the ice level can throw you off badly, since you'll slide 3 or 4 lines over whenever you pull a corner.[CR]Now, let me state that this game has one of the most retarded storylines I've ever seen in a game; a storyline so bad it makes the one from Blaster Master seem believable and brilliant. Any explanation I'll give won't come close to explaining it, so here it is:[CR]"Joe was a teacher.."[CR]"He saved a student."[CR]"A car hit him!"[CR]"Dr. Wit asked him to join his Joke Army and take over the world. Joe refused and became Naked Man!"[CR]"Now save the world!!"[CR]Oh god, where to begin.. First of all, seeing the pictures during this intro will help, I guess.. But I have to wonder; since when does getting mangled by a car suddenly make you a candidate for some evil genius's army? I guess that's why it's called the Joke Army; I know I'd think it was a joke if some guy in a full body cast came wheeling at me in a gurney groaning that he was here to kick my ass and take over the world.[CR]But, Joe refuses, and becomes.. Naked Man? Way to go there, Dr. Wit; give the person who refuses to work for you Super Powers. Maybe he isn't so much a genius as he is evil. At least Naked Man's powers seem to suck really badly compared to most super heroes.[CR]Oh, and most of the Joke Army lives up to its name, with one opponent who's apparently a relative of the Invisible Dick Licking Clown from Citizen X.[CR]But, if you basically ignore the story Wit's is a pretty fun, albeit short game to kill some time with.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]Well, the translation is good, especially since there seemed to be some technical issues with hacking this game. The only japanese text was the intro, which you can read in the game review above.[CR]Reviewer: Silver X[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/652/[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Wizardry - Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]   Wizardry is a first-person,                       grid-based,  RPG that had helped to set many standards within the PC-RPG genre with its graphical interface and gameplay mechanics. It is regarded as the first true party-based RPG for computers and one of the first to feature a game system styled after TSR's Dungeons and Dragons. At the time, its graphical capabilities and gameplay mechanics were considered revolutionary and innovative for PCs. After assembling their party of adventurers, the player will confront many challenges and puzzles as they attempt to penetrate the dangers surrounding the ten-level Maze. The gameplay style of the title has been compared to that of a dungeon crawl in which players simply fight monsters for experience, treasure, and the necessary equipment to deal with the wizard, Werdna.The relatively simple and clear interface is organized around a series of commands and actions listed at the bottom of the screen as well as a combined inventory and statistics screen. Completing Wizardry was required if the player wished to transfer characters into the next two sequels,    Wizardry II: Knight of Diamonds and   Wizardry III: Legacy of Llylgamyn.  Among the other features of the game were: Over 50 spells were available for casting4 basic classes to choose from and four elite classes to upgrade to5 races to create classes with The game did not have any copy protection and creating  a Scenario Diskette was needed in order the game on. The CD-ROM version of the game automatically circumvented this by creating one on the drive when installed.  The manual was also noteworthy for being written in a way that made Wizardry appear appealing to newcomers with little to no experience with an RPG. Illustrated with humorous drawings and a great deal of detail worked into its text. A section walked a player through a fictional scenario that might occur within the game while explaining its concepts with several examples.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]   Wizardry's story is firmly rooted within fantasy and is considered the first module in a set of four that would end with  Wizardry IV: The Return of Werdna.  The Land of Llylgamyn is the home to many legends. It is considered the center of commerce and the home of an academy where the bravest would train themselves. It was ruled by a monarchy with a royal family, but as time passed, power shifted to the aristocrats and the theocrats and eventually, the royal family became a symbol of the land than a central source of power.  Under a more democratic system, the High Council of Sages appointed an overlord to govern over the kingdom, eliminating any power that hte royal family had left. The Overlord, Trebor, was a former warrior and a local hero. He governed wisely at first, but his thirst for power eventually led him to search for ways in which to expand his power. Eventually, through unknown means, he discovered the existence of an ancient amulet kept in a forgotten temple outside of the kingdom.  According to legend, it had great powers that were the stuff that legends were made of. Founding an expedition, he sent his best men out to find the temple and retrieve the amulet which they did with much success.  But only hours after the party had retrieved the amulet, an evil wizard named Werdna had follows his own trail to the amulet only to find it gone. Werdna, Trebor's arch-nemesis, was infuriated that someone had gotten to it first and using his considerable talents, used magic to discover who it was. When he found that it was Trebor, he plotted and schemed of a way to steal the amulet away.   As Trebor and a group of sages sat in his throne room studying the amulet, a great terror suddenly froze them cold as if the shadow of death has passed across their faces. When they came to, they discovered that his amulet was gone. Werdna knew that once they had recovered their senses, they would immediately cast their suspicions towards him. He couldn't return to his tower and wait for them to come for him anyway, so he needed a new place in which to hide. He decided on a bold plan. Werdna decided to use the amulet to make a new home right beneath the city of Llylgamym itself!  There was enough underground mining activity already and he should be able to go unnoticed within its depths. Upon the thought of this plan, the amulet began to glow. Suddenly, a tremendous earthquake shook the area and Werdna suddenly found himself within a giant, ten-level labyrinth in the ground below the city. Summoning monsters as allies, he made his way to the lowest levels where he could study the powers of the amulet undisturbed. In away, he also felt that he was secretly taunting his arch-nemesis by hiding right beneath his very nose with the object of his desire.    Trebor became unhinged at losing the amulet and surrounded himself with an elite guard of the best characters from each class all the while plotting to get his amulet back. He knew that the underground Maze was where his enemy had fled, but he could not get to him even with the best at his command. A year following his discovery of the Maze, he had managed to secure the first four floors. Most of the warriors that went deeper, however, never returned.  Trebor ordered the the passages to the deeper areas of the Maze sealed thus preventing the creatures there from finding their way to the surface. He also ordered that traps be set in the first three levels. Once all of this was done, he declared the Maze a Proving Ground for new cadets at the academy to prove their worth in the hopes of becoming one of the Elite guards. Trebor further sweetened the pot by saying that upon discovering the 'secret prize' at the lowest levels of the Maze. Those that survived their way down to the fourth level would be told the real reason for the Maze and the traps. The first four levels were only a test to see if those that survived were worthy of taking on the final challenges past them. It was then that they were told of Werdna and the amulet and be given permission to head deeper into the dungeon. Any adventurers who did recover the amulet would be inducted into his Elite guard, even by force if it comes to that. This is the situation that the player's party will find themselves in and it is from Trebor's castle that they will start their journey.  A journal entry from an adventurer named Hawkwind has also set the tone for the adventure to follow as he relates the story of his party getting ready to invade the the lower levels of the dungeon. He goes on to describe the pleasures that each of his party dream about in succeeding with their quest.   The journal describes how they made their way through zigzagging corridors down to the lower levels, suddenly discovering a secret door. Kicking it open, they enter the room and engage in battle against a myriad number of terrible beasts: hellhouds, demons, and even creeping coins. They fight their best, shaking the walls, and with a combination of hard steel and fantastic magic, destroy the enemy.   In the terrible battle, they discover a chute leading down into the bowels of the dungeon to the final level, setting the stage for the characters to do the same.  Ultimately, an unlikely group of characters prove themselves worthy of the challenge and manage to find their way down into the final level, confronting Werdna, and seizing back the amulet. As a reward, Trebor makes them Elite Guards and awards them a chevron for their troubles along with quite a prize in treasure.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]   Wizardry is a tile, or                                             grid based movement, first-person RPG starting out within the Castle that serves as the base for party management and the Maze in which the adventure takes place. Party size is limited to six members, although smaller parties are even allowed but not suggested for survival. The player must find penetrate the dangers and mysteries of the Maze in order to seize a magical amulet held by the evil wizard, Werdna. But, in order to do, the party must also negotiate the Maze and deal with its dangerous inhabitants as well as solve the puzzles that stand in their way. The Maze comprises the central theater for the adventure and is comprised of several levels, each with its own distinct dangers and puzzles to solve. The lack of an automap  means that the player is required to draw his or her own maps or otherwise rely on unofficial game guides and walkthroughs in order to navigate the mazelike multi-level dungeon.  Saves could only be made anywhere, but Wizardry's setup on PCs had an additional side-benefit to doing so. It would allow players to quick-save their progress and quit out of the scenario and if they chose to start at the Castle with a fresh party, they could wander back into the Maze and even encounter their old party where they had left them. This was also treated as a backup in case of PC failure. The party would be marked as OUT until the player decided to restart the group or create another party of adventurers and headed down to find them. Levels were earned after gaining the requisite experience as well as resting at the Inn back at the Castle. It was possible to continue adventuring well after the previous experience limit was met and earning several levels at once after a restful stay at the Inn.  The CastleThis was the central location for the player's management options concerning their party. Here, several locations were available by hotkey: Gilgamesh's Tavern - A dim and smoke filled place with a perpetual haunch of boar roasting over the fire, small groups of adventurers congregate here discussing their latest exploits or hoping to join a party. This is where the player will build their party from characters they create.Adventurer's Inn - Rest is offered as long as the party can afford their stay. Several different rooms are provided ranging from the Stables to a Royal Suite, each with their own rate of healing. This is also where resting characters can level up once they have the requisite experience.Temple of Cant - More severe ailments are handled here, again for the right 'donation'. Paralysis, poison, and even the dead can be brought back to a sense of normalcy after enough coins are shared with the faithful. Boltac's Trading Post - A friendly dwarf named Boltac operates this in the Castle's market area, providing his services to anyone that can afford them. Arms, goods, and even his experience in identifying certain items can all be purchased with the right coin. The party can even sell their ill gotten gains here to free up their pockets for even more loot that they might come across. Boltac can even remove cursed items, although the party will also lose the item once it's "uncursed."Edge of Town - From here, the party can visit the Training Grounds, enter the Maze, or head back to the Castle.The Maze - Many adventurers seeking fame, glory, and experience eagerly dive into the dangers of the Maze otherwise known as the Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord.Training Grounds - New characters are created here and players can also inspect older characters to see if they need a few changes of their own. Picking Locks and Disarming Traps There were no locks to pick in the game. Disarming traps, on the other hand, on treasure chests, was much more different. A character with the proper skill could inspect the chest and determine what kind of trap was on it. Once they made their assessment, it was up to the player to disarm the trap by opting to do so and then typing the trap's name in. If they are correct, the trap is disarmed. Spells could also be used to help disarm chests. CampingThis command allowed the party to camp out in the middle of the dungeon. This also enabled the player to inspect their party members and also re-order their party's marching order. This also allows the player to equip their entire party at once if they so choose. [CR]Character Development[CR]The player can opt to start with the batch of pre-made character provided for them by the game or create their own.  AgeCharacters can actually age in Wizardry V if they rest too much. Resting at the Inn can last anywhere from a single day to a year depending on how much gold you have in reserve. Resting replenishes a party's health and stamina, readying them for the road ahead, but rest enough times and a character will start to age. But when they first start out in the game, they are at an extremely young age. Death by old age is hardly expected, but it is a possibility.  Classes   The character classes belong to one of two categories; Base or Elite. Base classes (Fighter, Mage, Priest, Thief) are often considered the 'starting' class for a character whereas Elite classes (Lord, Bishop, Samurai, Lord, Ninja) typically benefit from having better fighting skills and eventual proficiency in magic. The initial statistics requirements for Elite classes are noticably higher than for the Base classes, making the former much more difficult to create at the start of the game.   As with quite a few RPGs, Wizardry includes the option to change character class during the course of the game at the Training Grounds when inspecting a character. The incentives to do so in Wizardry are comparatively strong as many abilities are retained from the original classes, and since characters who recently changed classes during mid-game can often gain levels rapidly (thus enabling the player to raise skill points and fill out spell books much faster than would otherwise have been possibly).    Alignment largely determines what kind of class a particular character can be. The four basic classes are:Fighter - High hit points and experts at using any weapon and piece of armor, they are a grounded class that can dish out the damage as well as take it. Thief - No party is complete without a competent thief to help disarm traps. While they aren't the greatest of fighters, they rely on their sneakiness to backstab their enemies.Priest - Long known as skilled healers, their talents are important for any party heading out into danger. They cannot be of neutral alignment.Mage - The classic wizard. As they become more powerful, their spellbooks will continue to add many new pages filled with deadly spells.  The four elite classes are: Bishop - Like a Priest, they are able to heal their friends and dispel the undead. They are also able to uncurse items that become permanently stuck to a character, freeing them. They can also learn any spell from any of the other schools. The downside is that their learning rate is also a bit slower, so the selection of spells that they may have will take more time to develop. But they can identify items without fear of being cursed. They must not be neutral.Samurai - A true swordsman. At the fourth level of experience, they begin to learn Mage spells. They cannot be of evil alignment because of their adherence to the code of Bushido.Lord - Skilled as a fighter as well as being pious enough to cast a few spells, they are likened to paladins and crusader knights. They start learning priestly spells around the fourth level of experience. They can also only be of good alignment.Ninja - An assassin and a rogue, they can kill with weapons or their bare hands, sometimes being able to kill the strongest enemy with a single blow. They disdain armor and become far harder to hit and tougher to kill as they gain levels. They also have all of the skills of thief and are able to disarm traps. They can also hide in shadows and ambush enemies. They must also be of evil alignment. RacesThe races include familiar fantasy characters such as the Elf, the Dwarf, the Gnome and the Hobbit.Humans - Balanced without any serious flaws, a good, even keeled race that can belong and excel at any profession.Elf - They excel at the intellectual classes, such as Mages, or Bishops. Keenly interested in study.Dwarf - Gruff, short in stature, but tough and reliable, dwarves make excellent Fighters while their piety can also find them a career as a Priest.Gnomes - Found underground and often overlooked by the larger races, their quiet and studious nature make them ideal as Mages or Priests.Hobbit - Friendly, nimble, and otherwise unassuming, they make surprisingly decent Ninja, Samurai, or Thieves.Statistics Attribute scores had a maximum value of 18 and determined a variety of effects and class eligibility requirements. Many of these attributes were particularly important across many classes across a variety of skills. Characters can improve their attributes thanks to the investment of points earned with every level.  Strength - Determines how much damage a character can lay into a monster as well as how much weight they can carry around with them. It also affects certain weapon skills and plays into staminaI.Q. - Important for spellcasters.Piety - This is important for a character's ability to concentrate on the task at hand. It also affects how many spells a character may be able to learn and their effectiveness with them.Vitality - Very important for hit points, the chance for resurrection, the ability to resist damage and disease, and general health.Luck - Ambiguous but it also has mysterious effects on many other factorsAs with many RPGs, character development was driven by experience points which translated into levels. When a character gains a level after resting an an inn: Spellcasters may be able to learn a new spellDepending on their statistics, a character may even change their classHit points will also improve [CR]Combat[CR]   Combat in Wizardry was a turn based affair with random encounters providing the cannon fodder that would feed the party's thirst for experience points.  When enemies encountered the party, a list of enemies along with a picture showing what they were onscreen would appear.   Similar to other RPGs of the era, its strict turn-based system halts the passage of time until the player performs an action (such as moving around or casting spells). In combat, the order in which characters act is determined primarily by their statistics, although the player issues orders to every character in the party before commencing a turn. Besides using melee and/or ranged weapons and casting spells, characters with the appropriate skills can hide (which means enemies cannot hurt them), use items in their inventory, equip new weapons or items or try to run away from battle which, if successful, results in the entire party fleeing from the enemies. It is not possible to save the game or restore a saved game while in combat mode, but there are no other restrictions on when and where the player can save the game.  In each round of combat, everyone makes their selection of actions as the game calculates who will have initiative and then executing their orders.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Free Money[CR]A good, but tedious way to gain some money.  If you've ever played this game, you should have noticed that when you create a character, they come with their own little ammount of money.  Since you can pool money to a single character and delete character, you can create create and create character, pool all their money to a single character and delete them and restart.  It's a long and tedious process, but it can get you some money for those expinsive weapons.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]  Cover art for the Famicom version  Wizardry II is a first-person,                                                  grid-based,  RPG that is part of a series that had helped to set many standards within the PC-RPG genre with its graphical interface and gameplay mechanics. At the time, the series' graphical capabilities and gameplay mechanics were considered revolutionary and innovative for PCs. Wizardry II continues the story begun with the first game and allows players to import characters in from                           Wizardry I to continue the quest in a new scenario.  The original versions of the game did not allow for players to roll up new characters making it a requirement to import those made in                        Wizardry I in order to start the game. This was because the series attempted to create a sense of continuity by making it a necessity in carrying over these characters, aiming squarely at the veteran market.  Later versions of the game would allow players to roll up new characters. After assembling their party of adventurers, the player will confront many challenges and puzzles as they attempt to penetrate the dangers in a bid to survive the challenges of another dangerous dungeon in a bid to recover the fabled Staff of Gnilda. But first, they must recover the pieces of armor that had once belonged to the Knight of Diamonds. The gameplay style of the title has been compared to that of a dungeon crawl in which players simply fight monsters for experience and treasure. It is exactly the same as the first game, only now with a different scenario.The relatively simple and clear interface is organized around a series of commands and actions listed at the bottom of the screen as well as a combined inventory and statistics screen. Completing Wizardry was required if the player wished to transfer characters into the next sequel,                          Wizardry III: Legacy of Llylgamyn.  Among the other features of the game were: Over 50 spells were available for casting4 basic classes to choose from and four elite classes to upgrade to5 races to create classes with The game did not have any copy protection and creating  a Scenario Diskette was needed in order the game on. The CD-ROM version of the game automatically circumvented this by creating one on the drive when installed. The console iterations of the game, such as that released for the NES, featured better graphics particularly in replacing the wireframe dungeon visuals. The manual was also noteworthy for being written in a way that made Wizardry appear appealing to newcomers with little to no experience with an RPG. Illustrated with humorous drawings and a great deal of detail worked into its text. A section walked a player through a fictional scenario that might occur within the game while explaining its concepts with several examples.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]  A dungeon  Wizardry's story is firmly rooted within fantasy and is considered the second module in a set of four linked by a story arc that would end with                             Wizardry IV: The Return of Werdna. Knight of Diamonds takes place almost immediately following the events of the first game, although experience with it was not necessary to begin this scenario. After evil wizard, Werdna's, defeat in the previous adventure, the formerly Mad Overlord, Trebor, sent his remaining army to clean out the rest of the infamous Maze that he had turned into his personal Proving Grounds. Upon exterminating every monster within its depths, Trebor decided to use the mystical amulet that adventurers had seized from the wicked wizard to guarantee that Werdna would never return.  With its power, Trebor was able to slightly alter the structure of the Maze that lay below his Castle at the heart of the kingdom and ordered guards to patrol the passages to ensure that Werdna would not be able to return from the dead. His obsession with Werdna's return, however, had ultimately pushed him to suicide and rumors say that his ghost haunts the Maze in a fruitless search for the return of his former arch-nemesis. With Trebor dead, the power of the city was once again divided between the High Council and the Royal Family. Hailed as heroes, the adventurers that had defeated Werdna were offered one of hte highest honors within the kingdom.  It has been two years since the death of Trebor, and now another crisis has erupted.  The city of Llylgamym has always been under the protection of a powerful artifact known as the Staff of Gnilda. Its power surrounded the city with a magical field protecting it from evil influence. Anyone who wished harmful intent for the city of Llylgamyn would find themselves unable to enter its gates while those who did not were free to come and go as they pleased. The presence of the staff seemed to present the perfect defense, but there was a way around it, something that Werdna himself took advantage of. The staff could only stop evil from entering the city, but if evil was born within its walls, that person remained unaffected by its power.    Werdna was a native of the kingdom which allowed him to challenge Trebor directly with his power, but there was another born within the walls of Llylgamyn that also held avarice within his heart. His name was Davalpus. Davalpus soon called upon the darkest of monsters and with their help, stormed the castle and slew the Royal Family. Or, at least, he thought he had. Only Prince Alavik and his sister, Princess Margda, escaped. They knew that the only hope of defeating Davalpus lay with the Staff of Gnilda which was held deep within the underground temple deep below the Royal Castle. It was placed there, long ago, by a hero known only as the Knight of Diamonds and in order to handle the staff, a person must be dressed from head to toe in his armor. The armor itself is scattered throughout the temple and heavily guarded. Entering the temple undetected, the Prince was able to retrieve the armor and with it, the Staff.  Prepared with both the armor and the Staff, the Prince confronted Davalpus in an epic battle. As the Prince landed the killing blow, Davalpus uttered a terrible curse whose infernal power was so great that it reduced the castle to rubble leaving the Temple of Gnilda open to all. With a flash of light, both the Prince and the body of the evil Davalpus disappeared in the chaos. The Staff had also disappeared.  But more worrisome was that the god, Gnilda, was heard by the people of the city to say "I have found this city unworthy of my protection and have hidden my Staff within the depths of my temple. If the Staff is sought out and returned to my main chamber, I will once again place the city under my protection. This is the word of Gnilda."  News of this event had spread throughout the kingdom. The city was, for the first time in as many years, vulnerable. The call went out to find those who would be powerful enough to accept the challenge and retrieve the Staff.    It was then that the High Council of Sages turned to the heroes that had saved the land before. They remember their deeds and have implored them to help once more. If successful, great rewards and even greater honors will be heaped at their feet. Needless to say, the adventurers accepted.  After many adventures and battles within the dungeon-like corridors of the temple, the party proved successful in retrieving the Staff of Gnilda saving the city from the evils of war. As a token of their gratitude, the High Council has marked the party with the "Mark of Gnilda" and have bestowed upon them the order of "Knight of the City".[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]  The game is played from a first-person perspective  Wizardry II is exactly the same as its predecessor; a tile, or                                                                        grid based movement,                     first-person RPG starting out within the Castle that serves as the base for party management and the Maze in which the adventure takes place. Party size is limited to six members, although smaller parties are even allowed but not suggested for survival. The player must find penetrate the dangers and mysteries of the Maze in order to recover the pieces of armor that had once belonged to the Knight of Diamonds.  Difficulty within the Wizardry series, particularly the  The Maze comprises the central theater for the adventure and is comprised of several levels, each with its own distinct dangers and puzzles to solve. The lack of an automap  means that the player is required to draw his or her own maps or otherwise rely on unofficial game guides and walkthroughs in order to navigate the mazelike multi-level dungeon.  Saves could only be made anywhere, but Wizardry II's setup on PCs had an additional side-benefit to doing so. It would allow players to quick-save their progress and quit out of the scenario and if they chose to start at the Castle with a fresh party, they could wander back into the Maze and even encounter their old party where they had left them. This was also treated as a backup in case of PC failure. The party would be marked as OUT until the player decided to restart the group or create another party of adventurers and headed down to find them. Levels were earned after gaining the requisite experience as well as resting at the Inn back at the Castle. It was possible to continue adventuring well after the previous experience limit was met and earning several levels at once after a restful stay at the Inn.  The CastleThis was the central location for the player's management options concerning their party. Here, several locations were available by hotkey: Gilgamesh's Tavern - A dim and smoke filled place with a perpetual haunch of boar roasting over the fire, small groups of adventurers congregate here discussing their latest exploits or hoping to join a party. This is where the player will build their party from characters they create.Adventurer's Inn - Rest is offered as long as the party can afford their stay. Several different rooms are provided ranging from the Stables to a Royal Suite, each with their own rate of healing. This is also where resting characters can level up once they have the requisite experience.Temple of Cant - More severe ailments are handled here, again for the right 'donation'. Paralysis, poison, and even the dead can be brought back to a sense of normalcy after enough coins are shared with the faithful. Boltac's Trading Post - A friendly dwarf named Boltac operates this in the Castle's market area, providing his services to anyone that can afford them. Arms, goods, and even his experience in identifying certain items can all be purchased with the right coin. The party can even sell their ill gotten gains here to free up their pockets for even more loot that they might come across. Boltac can even remove cursed items, although the party will also lose the item once it's "uncursed."Edge of Town - From here, the party can visit the Training Grounds, enter the Maze, or head back to the Castle.The Maze - Many adventurers seeking fame, glory, and experience eagerly dive into the dangers of the Maze otherwise known as the Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord.Training Grounds - New characters are created here and players can also inspect older characters to see if they need a few changes of their own. Picking Locks and Disarming Traps There were no locks to pick in the game.                    Disarming traps, on the other hand, on treasure chests, was much more different. A character with the proper skill could inspect the chest and determine what kind of trap was on it. Once they made their assessment, it was up to the player to disarm the trap by opting to do so and then typing the trap's name in. If they are correct, the trap is disarmed. Spells could also be used to help disarm chests. CampingThis command allowed the party to camp out in the middle of the dungeon. This also enabled the player to inspect their party members and also re-order their party's marching order. This also allows the player to equip their entire party at once if they so choose. [CR]Character Development[CR]The original versions of Wizardry II were aimed squarely at veterans that had played through the first game,                       Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord. Characters created in that game were required to start this new scenario. Later versions of Wizardry II, however, would remove this restriction and make it possible to roll up new characters using the same rules of the first game. AgeCharacters can actually age in Wizardry II if they rest too much. Resting at the Inn can last anywhere from a single day to a year depending on how much gold you have in reserve. Resting replenishes a party's health and stamina, readying them for the road ahead, but rest enough times and a character will start to age. But when they first start out in the game, they are at an extremely young age. Death by old age is hardly expected, but it is a possibility.  Classes   The character classes belong to one of two categories; Base or Elite. Base classes (Fighter, Mage, Priest, Thief) are often considered the 'starting' class for a character whereas Elite classes (Lord, Bishop, Samurai, Lord, Ninja) typically benefit from having better fighting skills and eventual proficiency in magic. The initial statistics requirements for Elite classes are noticably higher than for the Base classes, making the former much more difficult to create at the start of the game.   As with the first game (and what would become an integral part of its gameplay formula), Wizardry II includes the option to change character class during the course of the game at the Training Grounds when inspecting a character. The incentives to do so in Wizardry are comparatively strong as many abilities are retained from the original classes, and since characters who recently changed classes during mid-game can often gain levels rapidly (thus enabling the player to raise skill points and fill out spell books much faster than would otherwise have been possibly).    Alignment largely determines what kind of class a particular character can be. The four basic classes are: Fighter - High hit points and experts at using any weapon and piece of armor, they are a grounded class that can dish out the damage as well as take it.  Thief - No party is complete without a competent thief to help disarm traps. While they aren't the greatest of fighters, they rely on their sneakiness to backstab their enemies. Priest - Long known as skilled healers, their talents are important for any party heading out into danger. They cannot be of neutral alignment. Mage - The classic wizard. As they become more powerful, their spellbooks will continue to add many new pages filled with deadly spells.  The four elite classes are: Bishop - Like a Priest, they are able to heal their friends and dispel the undead. They are also able to uncurse items that become permanently stuck to a character, freeing them. They can also learn any spell from any of the other schools. The downside is that their learning rate is also a bit slower, so the selection of spells that they may have will take more time to develop. But they can identify items without fear of being cursed. They must not be neutral. Samurai - A true swordsman. At the fourth level of experience, they begin to learn Mage spells. They cannot be of evil alignment because of their adherence to the code of Bushido.Lord - Skilled as a fighter as well as being pious enough to cast a few spells, they are likened to paladins and crusader knights. They start learning priestly spells around the fourth level of experience. They can also only be of good alignment. Ninja - An assassin and a rogue, they can kill with weapons or their bare hands, sometimes being able to kill the strongest enemy with a single blow. They disdain armor and become far harder to hit and tougher to kill as they gain levels. They also have all of the skills of thief and are able to disarm traps. They can also hide in shadows and ambush enemies. They must also be of evil alignment. RacesThe races include familiar fantasy characters such as the Elf, the Dwarf, the Gnome and the Hobbit. Humans - Balanced without any serious flaws, a good, even keeled race that can belong and excel at any profession. Elf - They excel at the intellectual classes, such as Mages, or Bishops. Keenly interested in study. Dwarf - Gruff, short in stature, but tough and reliable, dwarves make excellent Fighters while their piety can also find them a career as a Priest. Gnomes - Found underground and often overlooked by the larger races, their quiet and studious nature make them ideal as Mages or Priests. Hobbit - Friendly, nimble, and otherwise unassuming, they make surprisingly decent Ninja, Samurai, or Thieves.Statistics Attribute scores had a maximum value of 18 and determined a variety of effects and class eligibility requirements. Many of these attributes were particularly important across many classes across a variety of skills. Characters can improve their attributes thanks to the investment of points earned with every level.  Strength - Determines how much damage a character can lay into a monster as well as how much weight they can carry around with them. It also affects certain weapon skills and plays into staminaI.Q. - Important for spellcasters.Piety - This is important for a character's ability to concentrate on the task at hand. It also affects how many spells a character may be able to learn and their effectiveness with them.Vitality - Very important for hit points, the chance for resurrection, the ability to resist damage and disease, and general health.Luck - Ambiguous but it also has mysterious effects on many other factorsAs with many RPGs, character development is driven by        experience points which translates into levels. When a character gains a level after resting an an inn: Spellcasters may be able to learn a new spellDepending on their statistics, a character may even change their classHit points will also improve [CR]Combat[CR]   Combat in Wizardry II is a                   turn based affair with                  random encounters providing the cannon fodder that would feed the party's thirst for                 experience points.  When enemies encountered the party, a list of enemies along with a picture showing what they were would appear on screen.   Similar to other RPGs of the era, its strict turn-based system halts the passage of time until the player performs an action (such as moving around or casting spells). In combat, the order in which characters act is determined primarily by their statistics, although the player issues orders to every character in the party before commencing a turn. Besides using                melee and/or ranged weapons and casting spells, characters with the appropriate skills can hide (which means enemies cannot hurt them), use items in their inventory, equip new weapons or items or try to run away from battle which, if successful, results in the entire party fleeing from the enemies. It is not possible to save the game or restore a saved game while in combat mode, but there are no other restrictions on when and where the player can save the game.  In each round of combat, everyone makes their selection of actions as the game calculates who will have initiative and then executing their orders.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wizardry III is a first-person, grid-based, RPG that is part of a series that had helped to set many standards within the PC-RPG genre with its graphical interface and gameplay mechanics. At the time, the series' graphical capabilities and gameplay mechanics were considered revolutionary and innovative for PCs. Wizardry III continues the story begun with the first game and allows players to import characters in from Wizardry I or Wizardry II to continue the quest in a new scenario. Unlike previous games, however, players CANNOT create new characters in this game. They must import characters from either of the previous two games. The mechanics, detailed below, remained the same.[CR]After assembling their party of adventurers, the player will confront many challenges and puzzles as they attempt to penetrate the dangers in a bid to survive the challenges of another dangerous dungeon in a bid to find the dragon, L'Kbreth, and recover the Orb of Earithin to help the Sages of the High Council discover the cause of the disasters facing the City of Llylgamyn. The gameplay style of the title has been compared to that of a dungeon crawl in which players simply fight monsters for experience and treasure. It is exactly the same as the first game, only now with a different scenario.[CR]The relatively simple and clear interface is organized around a series of commands and actions listed at the bottom of the screen as well as a combined inventory and statistics screen.[CR]Players could import characters from either Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord or Wizardry II: The Knight of Diamonds. It would be the last game in the "Werdna" arc to allow players in doing so. As a part of the story, the imported characters are referred to as the descendants of the original characters in order to maintain continuity.[CR]Among the other features of the game were:Over 50 spells were available for casting4 basic classes to choose from and four elite classes to upgrade to5 races to create classes with[CR]The game did not have any copy protection and creating a Scenario Diskette was needed in order the game on.

Illustrated with humorous drawings and a great deal of detail worked into its text. A section walked a player through a fictional scenario that might occur within the game while explaining its concepts with several examples.[CR]The NES version, by an odd twist of fate, was the second Wizardry game to be released for that system. It was called Wizardry II: The Legacy of Llylgamyn - The Third Scenario to reflect that it was both the second Wizardry game for the system and the third game overall. The actual Wizardry II would be released for NES later as Wizardry: The Knight of Diamonds - The Second Scenario, without the numeric.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Wizardry's story is firmly rooted within fantasy and is considered the second module in a set of four linked by a story arc that would end with Wizardry IV: The Return of Werdna. Legacy of Llylgamyn takes place a generation following the events of the second game, although experience with it was not necessary to begin this scenario.[CR]A generation has passed since a brave band of adventurers had managed to regain the fabled armor of the Knight of Diamonds and return the legendary artifact, the Staff of Gnilda, to its rightful place in protecting the city from evil. Under its power, the City of Llylgamyn has become a place of light and beauty where war and the horror that it brings have become long forgotten. But the peace has been rocked by nature gone awry. Over the past several years, freak earthquakes, changes in climate, and thundering storms have reached the ears of the kingdom's people. Most have ignored them.[CR]But when the gentle seas surrounding the prosperous island colony of Arbithea suddenly rose and swamped the island, no one could ignore these signs for much longer. The tidal wave had washed away Arbithea's cities leaving only its highest peaks above the roiling waves. Soon after, Llylgamyn itself was shaken by an earthquake so powerful that the sacred Temple of Gnilda was damaged. Nearby, ancient volcanoes rumbled themselves awake. Soon, self-appointed prophets spoke of divine wrath, demanding that the people repent. Mystics consulted the Tarot, astrologers warned of great comets falling from the heavens bringing with them utter destruction, and priests of the old religions talk of the death of the Great World Serpent and the end of existence.[CR]Wiser heads called for a new generation of adventurers from all walks of life and creeds to seek the cause of these troubles. Like their ancestors long before them, these new adventurers would quest to save Llylgamyn from the perils facing the mighty city. The greatest Sages and Wizards of the kingdom came together and had agreed that only one thing could reveal the truth behind the dangers facing them: a mystical orb taken by the mighty dragon, L'Kbreth. L'Kbreth, one the World Serpent's five children, is dedicated to the preservation of balance in the world and had deemed that the great orb, left in mankind's hands, might upset the balance. According to legend, the dragon took the orb with her to her lair and there, invoked the powers of both good and evil to protect it from would-be thieves.[CR]The leaders of Llylgamyn appeal to these new adventurers, the descendants of the heroes and heroines of the Knight of Diamonds, the children of the survivors of the Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord, to take up their memories and their skills to seek out L'Kbreth. Only by facing the dragon and beseeching its aid may they receive the Orb of Earithin.[CR]These new adventurers proudly step forward and accept the burden given to them by the Elders. Aided by the spirits of their ancestors, they feel confident that they will be able to succeed. From this day forward, they will take the name of their legendary forefathers and through a mystical ceremony, will be able to speak with their spirit and ask for guidance. But from then on, they and their fellow descendants will be alone. They must make their way to the ruined palace and from there, climb their way to the top of the mountain. But only both good and evil can hope to reclaim the Orb.[CR]After many adventures, such a party did succeed in facing the dangers of the dungeon. By solving riddles, they created a magical crystal that allowed them to pass the dragon, L'Kbreth, who greeted them as heroes. A final riddle faced them before the Orb could be theirs and by answering it, were able to reclaim the relic and return with it to the City of Llylgamyn.[CR]With the Orb of Earithin, the Sages of Llylgamyn will be able to find the true cause of the disasters facing the kingdom. In appreciation for their help, Queen Beyki, gave each party member the Star of Llylgamyn and invited they and others to share in the reward for a hard fought end to their quest.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Wizardry III is exactly the same as its predecessor; a tile, or grid based movement, first-person RPG starting out within the Castle that serves as the base for party management and the Maze in which the adventure takes place.

Spells could also be used to help disarm chests.Camping[CR]This command allowed the party to camp out in the middle of the dungeon. This also enabled the player to inspect their party members and also re-order their party's marching order. This also allows the player to equip their entire party at once if they so choose.[CR]Character Development[CR]Unlike previous games in the series, players had to import characters into Wizardry III from either Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord or Knight of Diamonds. All of the other mechanics, however, remained the same.Age[CR]Characters can actually age in Wizardry II if they rest too much. Resting at the Inn can last anywhere from a single day to a year depending on how much gold you have in reserve. Resting replenishes a party's health and stamina, readying them for the road ahead, but rest enough times and a character will start to age. But when they first start out in the game, they are at an extremely young age. Death by old age is hardly expected, but it is a possibility.Alignment[CR]Although alignment was a choice that helped to determine what classes a character could become, it has an expanded role in Wizardry III. Party mix was now impacted by the alignment of its member characters (good and evil characters would be unable to be in the same party, although they could be a member of a neutral one). Certain areas within the dungeon were accessible only to parties of certain alignments.[CR]The second and fourth levels of the dungeon, in particular, were only accessible by parties with no evil characters among their ranks. The sixth, and final, level could only be accessed by a party with at least one character devoted to either good or evil. Neutral parties were able to traverse into all areas except for the final level.Imported Characters: The Legacy[CR]Imported characters were treated as descendants of the original adventurers that had traveled the dungeons of the Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord or had quested to recover the armor of the Knight of Diamonds. They would basically start out as first level characters with only the barest of essentials as if they had begun as a freshly rolled party.Classes[CR]The character classes belong to one of two categories; Base or Elite. Base classes (Fighter, Mage, Priest, Thief) are often considered the 'starting' class for a character whereas Elite classes (Lord, Bishop, Samurai, Lord, Ninja) typically benefit from having better fighting skills and eventual proficiency in magic. The initial statistics requirements for Elite classes are noticably higher than for the Base classes, making the former much more difficult to create at the start of the game.[CR]As with the first game (and what would become an integral part of its gameplay formula), Wizardry III includes the option to change character class during the course of the game at the Training Grounds when inspecting a character. The incentives to do so in Wizardry are comparatively strong as many abilities are retained from the original classes, and since characters who recently changed classes during mid-game can often gain levels rapidly (thus enabling the player to raise skill points and fill out spell books much faster than would otherwise have been possibly).[CR]Alignment largely determines what kind of class a particular character can be.[CR]The four basic classes are:Fighter - High hit points and experts at using any weapon and piece of armor, they are a grounded class that can dish out the damage as well as take it.Thief - No party is complete without a competent thief to help disarm traps. While they aren't the greatest of fighters, they rely on their sneakiness to backstab their enemies.Priest - Long known as skilled healers, their talents are important for any party heading out into danger. They cannot be of neutral alignment.Mage - The classic wizard. As they become more powerful, their spellbooks will continue to add many new pages filled with deadly spells.[CR]The four elite classes are:Bishop - Like a Priest, they are able to heal their friends and dispel the undead. They are also able to uncurse items that become permanently stuck to a character, freeing them. They can also learn any spell from any of the other schools. The downside is that their learning rate is also a bit slower, so the selection of spells that they may have will take more time to develop. But they can identify items without fear of being cursed. They must not be neutral.Samurai - A true swordsman. At the fourth level of experience, they begin to learn Mage spells. They cannot be of evil alignment because of their adherence to the code of Bushido.Lord - Skilled as a fighter as well as being pious enough to cast a few spells, they are likened to paladins and crusader knights. They start learning priestly spells around the fourth level of experience. They can also only be of good alignment.Ninja - An assassin and a rogue, they can kill with weapons or their bare hands, sometimes being able to kill the strongest enemy with a single blow. They disdain armor and become far harder to hit and tougher to kill as they gain levels. They also have all of the skills of thief and are able to disarm traps. They can also hide in shadows and ambush enemies. They must also be of evil alignment.Races[CR]The races include familiar fantasy characters such as the Elf, the Dwarf, the Gnome and the Hobbit. Although Wizardry III's characters were imported, the race descriptions below were still useful references for players.Humans - Balanced without any serious flaws, a good, even keeled race that can belong and excel at any profession.Elf - They excel at the intellectual classes, such as Mages, or Bishops. Keenly interested in study.Dwarf - Gruff, short in stature, but tough and reliable, dwarves make excellent Fighters while their piety can also find them a career as a Priest.Gnomes - Found underground and often overlooked by the larger races, their quiet and studious nature make them ideal as Mages or Priests.Hobbit - Friendly, nimble, and otherwise unassuming, they make surprisingly decent Ninja, Samurai, or Thieves.Statistics[CR]Attribute scores had a maximum value of 18 and determined a variety of effects and class eligibility requirements. Many of these attributes were particularly important across many classes across a variety of skills. Characters can improve their attributes thanks to the investment of points earned with every level.Strength - Determines how much damage a character can lay into a monster as well as how much weight they can carry around with them. It also affects certain weapon skills and plays into staminaI.Q. - Important for spellcasters.Piety - This is important for a character's ability to concentrate on the task at hand. It also affects how many spells a character may be able to learn and their effectiveness with them.Vitality - Very important for hit points, the chance for resurrection, the ability to resist damage and disease, and general health.Luck - Ambiguous but it also has mysterious effects on many other factors[CR]As with many RPGs, character development was driven by experience points which translated into levels. When a character gains a level after resting an an inn:Spellcasters may be able to learn a new spellDepending on their statistics, a character may even change their classHit points will also improve[CR]Combat[CR]Combat in Wizardry III is a turn based affair with random encounters providing the cannon fodder that would feed the party's thirst for experience points. When enemies encountered the party, a list of enemies along with a picture showing what they were onscreen would appear.[CR]Similar to other RPGs of the era, its strict turn-based system halts the passage of time until the player performs an action (such as moving around or casting spells). In combat, the order in which characters act is determined primarily by their statistics, although the player issues orders to every character in the party before commencing a turn. Besides using melee and/or ranged weapons and casting spells, characters with the appropriate skills can hide (which means enemies cannot hurt them), use items in their inventory, equip new weapons or items or try to run away from battle which, if successful, results in the entire party fleeing from the enemies. It is not possible to save the game or restore a saved game while in combat mode, but there are no other restrictions on when and where the player can save the game.[CR]In each round of combat, everyone makes their selection of actions as the game calculates who will have initiative and then executing their orders.[CR]</plot>

In the mean time, apparently someone translated the MSX version of the game, which is probably both a way better game and a way better translation hack.

				<title_clean>Wrecking Crew</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wrecking Crew is a Mario game developed by Nintendo. It was released in Japan on June 18, 1985, and North America on October 18, 1985. It was originally released for the arcades as Vs. Wrecking Crew in 1984.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The title screen to Wrecking Crew.[CR]Wrecking Crew is a puzzle game which requires the player control a hammer-wielding Mario (similar to the one in the old Donkey Kong games) though each of the 100 stages in the game. Players can choose to begin at any level from the title screen. Mario cannot jump in Wrecking Crew, so to be successful the player must destroy objects in a certain order as they move through each level. If Mario destroyed something too soon, the player may get stuck and will need to restart the level. These objects include walls, pillars, ladders, and bombs which will explode and destroy all connected destructible objects. By destroying objects, the player will also gain points to be added to their score.Most stages look similar to this, depending on position ingame.[CR]When starting the game, Mario begins with five lives, Mario will lose a life every time he touches an enemy. There are doors in Wrecking Crew which Mario can open causing enemies to pass through them and move into the background where they cannot harm him. Enemies include fireballs, wrenches, and Eggplant Men. There is also a construction foreman named "Spike" who will chase Mario and attempt to make Mario fall back to the bottom of the level by knocking down certain objects.[CR]If the player gets stuck on a stage, they are able to go to the menu screen and select which stage they would like to go to. This feature is available right from the start. Because of this, it is possible to go to any stage, including the last, even if this was the player's first time playing.[CR]The player is able to restart a level whenever they like for the cost of a life. They will also need to restart a level if Mario becomes trapped in a barrel.[CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]Wrecking Crew also allows for two people to play together. Player 1 will play as Mario while Player 2 will play as a strangely purple Luigi. The game will end when both players have lost all of their lives.[CR]Level Editor[CR]Famicom Data Recorder.[CR]Wrecking Crew features a level editor that uses a Famicom Data Recorder which was a cassette tape device only released in Japan. Although the North American version of the game contains a level editor (players could design up to 4 levels), they aren't saved when the game is turned off.[CR]If a player is lucky enough to have a Famicom Data Recorder though, they should be able to create up to four of their very own saved custom levels to play in the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Gold Hammer[CR]In Phase 6, there will be five bombs. 2 on the bottom, 2 in the the middle of the level, and 1on the top. Hit the 2 bombs on the bottom and then hit the middle left bomb. In a few seconds, a hammer will appear. Hit it to obtain it. You now have the gold hammer. The music will change and you are now able to hit enemies. You will have the hammer untill you die.</plot>

				<title_clean>Xevious</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Xevious is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up developed by Namco and released in the Arcade in 1982. It is one of the first games of its genre, and contributed many things to that genre, including the concept of bosses. The game is known for having one continuous level, featuring forests, bases, temples, and waterways. Xevious was a huge cult hit in Japan, despite its limited popularity in the United States. The game was also considered to be the first Arcade game to have a television commercial aired for it in the United States.[CR]The player controls a Solvalou, a combat aircraft containing both a front-firing "shooter" for anti-air combat and a "bomber" for air-to-ground bombing runs. The game contains both enemy aircraft and enemy ground units, such as tanks and turrets. It is one of the first shoot-em-ups to include hidden bonuses, which could be uncovered by bombing particular areas in the game (these include the SOL towers, which takes one bomb to reveal and one to destroy, and special flags). It is also one of the first shoot-em-ups to include a boss, the massive flying fortress Andor Genesis.[CR]The game was also known for its glitches and Easter eggs. It's possible to see a short message showing the programmer's name by moving to the bottom-right of the screen, holding down the bomb button and destroying the first two enemies. Another rare Arcade glitch gave the player countless amounts of lives.[CR]Xevious was ported to many systems, including the NES, Atari 8-bit, Atari 7800, NEC PC-8801, NEC PC-9801, MSX, FM-7, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari ST, Apple II, Amstrad CPC, Sharp X1, and the Sharp X68000. The original Arcade game has been in many of Namco's compilations, including Namco Museum Volume 2 for the PlayStation, Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Gamecube, Namco Museum Remix for the Wii, Namco Museum DS for the Nintendo DS, Namco Museum Battle Collection for the PSP, and Namco Museum Essentials for the PlayStation Network (PS3). The game was released as a Xbox Live Arcade game on the Xbox Live Marketplace for 400 MSP ($5), which was later included in Namco Museum: Virtual Arcade for the Xbox 360. The game was also part of the Microsoft Revenge of Arcade compilation for the PC. The NES version of Xevious was also released for Game Boy Advance as part of the Classic NES Series.[CR]Xevious spawned a few obscure sequels.

				<title_clean>Xevious</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Xevious is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up developed by Namco and released in the Arcade in 1982. It is one of the first games of its genre, and contributed many things to that genre, including the concept of bosses. The game is known for having one continuous level, featuring forests, bases, temples, and waterways. Xevious was a huge cult hit in Japan, despite its limited popularity in the United States. The game was also considered to be the first Arcade game to have a television commercial aired for it in the United States.[CR]The player controls a Solvalou, a combat aircraft containing both a front-firing "shooter" for anti-air combat and a "bomber" for air-to-ground bombing runs. The game contains both enemy aircraft and enemy ground units, such as tanks and turrets. It is one of the first shoot-em-ups to include hidden bonuses, which could be uncovered by bombing particular areas in the game (these include the SOL towers, which takes one bomb to reveal and one to destroy, and special flags). It is also one of the first shoot-em-ups to include a boss, the massive flying fortress Andor Genesis.[CR]The game was also known for its glitches and Easter eggs. It's possible to see a short message showing the programmer's name by moving to the bottom-right of the screen, holding down the bomb button and destroying the first two enemies. Another rare Arcade glitch gave the player countless amounts of lives.[CR]Xevious was ported to many systems, including the NES, Atari 8-bit, Atari 7800, NEC PC-8801, NEC PC-9801, MSX, FM-7, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari ST, Apple II, Amstrad CPC, Sharp X1, and the Sharp X68000. The original Arcade game has been in many of Namco's compilations, including Namco Museum Volume 2 for the PlayStation, Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Gamecube, Namco Museum Remix for the Wii, Namco Museum DS for the Nintendo DS, Namco Museum Battle Collection for the PSP, and Namco Museum Essentials for the PlayStation Network (PS3). The game was released as a Xbox Live Arcade game on the Xbox Live Marketplace for 400 MSP ($5), which was later included in Namco Museum: Virtual Arcade for the Xbox 360. The game was also part of the Microsoft Revenge of Arcade compilation for the PC. The NES version of Xevious was also released for Game Boy Advance as part of the Classic NES Series.[CR]Xevious spawned a few obscure sequels. Super Xevious, released a year later on the arcades, was a harder version of the original with several new enemies. Solvalou, released in 1991 in Japan, is a version of Xevious shown from the first-person perspective.[CR] Xevious 3D/G, released in 1995 for arcades and the PlayStation, added 3D graphics while retaining the 2D viewpoint of the original. Xevious Arrangement was a special version of Xevious created for Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1. Xevious Resurrection is another special version of Xevious, but created for Namco Museum Essentials.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Debug Menu (Japanese version)[CR]At the title screen, on the 2nd controller, hold the A button and press Right 9 times, Up 2 times, Left 2 times &amp; Down 9 times.

Players control Oolong (Lee in the NES version), who must fight all martial arts masters in the game to gain the name of "Grand Master" and honor the memory of his father. The player can combine directions and the two attack buttons (one for kick, one for punch) to land blows on their opponent.Characters[CR]Buchu[CR]Buchu is a sumo wrestler who uses a leaping motion to land on the player. Buchu's size means he is a slow opponent though. Buchu does not use weapons to fight and he is the first opponent the player faces.[CR]Star[CR]Star is the first female opponent the player faces. She is a ninja dressed in pink who wields shuriken, which slow down the player, as well as an array of punches and kicks[CR]Nuncha[CR]Nuncha attacks the player with nunchuks, dressed in bright yellow. Like Star, his weapon can slow down the player.[CR]Pole[CR]Not surprisingly, Pole attacks the player with a pole, which he also uses to vault for extra speed and distance in his attacks.[CR]Feedle[CR]Feedle is an odd enemy, in that he replicates himself to attack the player from every side.

He attacks the player with a giant chain with a claw weapon attached to the end.[CR]Club[CR]Club wields a large spiked club, and uses a shield to block the player's attacks[CR]Fan[CR]Another character whose name is their weapon, Fan throws steel fans at the character, and launches ferocious attacks.[CR]Sword[CR]Sword uses a sword, and is adept at launching aerial attacks at the player.[CR]Tonfun[CR]The penultimate opponent, Tonfun tries to best the player using tonfa and martial arts. Key to victory is proper timing and waiting for openings in Tonfun's attacks.[CR]Blues[CR]Blues is the final opponent, and looks just like the player character, except he wears no shirt. After defeating Blues, the game starts over again at Buchu. Characters in NES and MSX ports[CR]Wang[CR]Wang is armed with a Pole, but does not use it as effectively as Pole.[CR]Tao[CR]Tao throws fireballs and is similar to Star.[CR]Chen[CR]Chen is basically a copy of Chain.[CR]Lang[CR]A quicker version of Star.[CR]Wu/Mu[CR]Wu in the MSX version, and Mu in the NES, he is very similar to Buchu, and after he is defeated, the challenge starts again.

The hero fights using a stream of throwing daggers that fly horizontally for a few meters before vanishing, which have an added benefit of being able to pass through walls. The player can also collect various power-ups to increase the strength of the hero's daggers, as well as gain XP after Youkai battles that will eventually increase the hero's parameters.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Stage Select[CR]When the Stage name is displayed (i.e. Stage 1: Kaoyashiki), quickly enter the following commands to skip to the desired stage.</plot>

				<plot>Woo-hoo! This is a most excellent translation of a most excellent game. If you haven't tried it yet, Ys play very much similar to Zelda, but is twice as fun and the dialogue is 10 times more engrossing. And it's pretty challenging, too! This is definitely the version of Ys to get, unless you happen to read Japanese or own a Turbo Duo. Heh.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]Makoknight and Co. did an excellent job with the translation; this is truly what I'd call a flawless script. It's much truer to the Ys saga than the Sega Translation was, and much more grammatically correct. So, what are you waiting for? Find the ROM, download the patch, and have a blast![CR]Reviewer: wraith[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/238/[CR]</plot>

				<plot>This is the second game in the long-running Ys action RPG series. A bright light shot up from Dahm Tower in the end of the first game, and our hero Adol Christian is awakened by a young girl who finds him lying on the ground. She introduces herself as Lilia and tells Adol he is in the land of Ys. Finally he was able to establish a connection between his world and this mysterious land! But finding the gateway to Ys is not enough: Adol must stop the evil entity that his archenemy Dark Fact served. And his foes already know where he is...[CR]This game is a direct sequel to what PC players know as  Ancient Land of Ys (of which the original NES version was simply called Ys), and is also the same game (story-wise) as the second part of Ys: Book I &amp; II for TurboGrafx CD. The gameplay utilizes an unusual action RPG combat style, where you don't press any attack button, but run into your enemies in order to cause damage. You should choose the angles and the measure of contact with the enemy carefully, otherwise you'll be dead. You can (and should) level up, perform quests for village people, gather money, and upgrade your weapons and inventory, like in any other RPG.</plot>

				<title_clean>Ys III - Wanderers from Ys</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ys III: Wanderers From Ys is the third entry in the Ys series. Taking place nearly three years after the events in Ys I &amp; II, Adol and his companion, Dogi, have been wandering the land. On their journey, the two had heard rumors regarding Dogi's hometown, Redmont, that prompted them to venture there. Dogi's hometown, located in the land of Felghana, had been experiencing crop failure as well as vicious nighttime attacks. Not afraid of the danger, Adol and Dogi set forth on their new adventure.[CR]Ys III, like its predecessors, was originally released on the NEC PC-8801 and its upgraded version PC-9801 in 1989. It was soon ported to other Japanese home computers, like the MSX and Sharp X68000. A couple of years later, it was ported to the SNES, Genesis and TurboGrafx-CD. These console ports all received English localizations.[CR]Ys III would be remade as Ys: The Oath in Felghana for the PC in 2005. It follows the same story, but uses the engine from Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim. Its PSP and 2012 Steam re-release versions were localized into English by XSEED.[CR]When released Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded scores of 7,8,7,8 saying, "...misses the high mark of the original. There is little or no challenge here and the whole quest is too straightforward for an adventure game".[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ys III features several new additions to the Ys series, while also retaining several components. The most important change comes in the form of it's gameplay. No longer played from a top-down perspective, Ys III is played from a side-scrolling perspective not unlike another Falcom-developed title, Sorcerian. With a change in perspective also comes a change in game mechanics. Players now have direct control over Adol's ability to attack, either with ducking, forward, or overhead sword attacks, which is a major departure from the previous game. In Ys I &amp; II, players had to come in contact with enemies in order to damage them, as the majority of attacks were done automatically. Only in Ys II did players have a controllable attack in the form of a fireball. Another major change is the ability to jump. Since Ys III is also a platformer, the game has been given vertical depth, and as such, Adol needs the ability to jump to attack certain enemies and overcome obstacles. Yet another change to the gameplay system is the omission of magic points. Replaced by consumable rings, players can accrue a stock of them by defeating enemies, and subsequently use them to power the different permanent rings that Adol finds over the course of his adventure. Also of note, is that Ys III does not feature as much back-tracking as it's predecessors, and is much shorter in length because of it.[CR]As for the components that Ys III kept, the first would be the wearable rings. Found at various points in the game, Adol can obtain five different rings - power, shield, time, heal, and protection - that have the same properties as they did in the previous games. Adol must also buy or find the different swords, shields, and armors throughout the game, with five items per category just like the previous games. In addition to Adol's equipment, he must also find an array of items, keys, and objects to aid him in his journey and to open up new paths. Ys III also has an experience point system like the previous games, however, depending on the version played, the game will either feature diminishing experience points ( TGCD) or not ( SNES). Ys III also allows players to save at any time they wish, except during boss fights.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Yume Penguin Monogatari</title_clean>
				<plot>Title Screen Yume Penguin Monogatari is a game developed by  Konami for the  Famicom and released in 1991. The story revolves around a penguin named  Penta who is dumped by his girlfriend Penko because he is too fat. She then gets a new boyfriend called Genji. The player must then play as Penta in a quest to loose weight to get back together with Penko. He does this by drinking diet soda and avoiding enemies which Genji has sent after Penta to force-feed him.It is believed that Penta is really  Pentarou, a character from other Konami games.Gameplay         The gameplay is a mix of platforming and shooting. Instead of a life-bar, you have a fitness-meter. This meter must be filled to a certain point marked by a broken heart, before each level is completed. Otherwise the level is restarted. To fill this meter, Penta has to collect diet soda. The meter goes down if Penta is hit by enemies or otherwise eats unhealthy food. There are six levels in the game. Three platforming levels, and three side-scrolling shooter stages. The goal is the same in all levels, to collect diet soda and fill the meter while avoiding enemies. The seventh level is the last boss, Genji, which is also a shooter level, but this time view from the rear.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Welcome to the Legend of Zelda. Where the only sound you'll hear is your own heart pounding as you race through forests, lakes, mountains and dungeonous mazes in an attempt to restore peace to the land of Hyrule. Along the way you'll be challenged by Tektites, Wizzrobes and an endless array of ruthless creatures who'll stop at nothing to prevent you from finding the lost fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom. But don't despair. With a little luck and a lot of courage, you'll conquer your adversaries, unite the Triforce fragments and unravel the mystery of the Legend of Zelda.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] How to bring up The Secret Save Screen[CR]For this code you need Two Controllers. On controller 1 Press start. On controller 2 Press Up and A at the same time. This will bring up The Secret Save Menu. So now you don't have to die to save.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Entrance to the Second Quest[CR]At the name entry screen enter [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Automatic health restoration[CR]When your health gauge is low, visit a lake of a Great Fairy to restore your life. When you approach the lake, your health will slowly fill. While your health is being restored, press start to enter the item selection subscreen, and your health will continue to fill. Using a controller in port 2, press Up + A to return to the save menu. Select SAVE, and load your character's file. Once loaded, instead of remaining at the default of 3 filled heart containers, Link will have his health fully restored at the start.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Fewer enemies[CR]Kill all the enemies except for one in a particular screen, and next time you go through there will only be that one enemy there, instead of them all coming back.</plot>

				<plot>In a game reminiscent of both Road Fighter and Rally Bike, the player takes control of a motorcyclist who's in a race to be the first to traverse the United States from the west to the east coast, starting in Los Angeles and ending up in New York City.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] consists of the player dodging cars and other roadway hazards on their way to the next checkpoint. Players can either accelerate or hit the brakes on their motorcycle so they can avoid getting into an accident. Accidents cause the player to lose fuel and running out of fuel can end the game. So players must keep an eye out on the fuel gauge, which can be refilled by fuel barrels littered throughout each stage. Each car the player passes betters their ranks which increases their score.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Zoids 2: Zenebasu no Gyakushuu is the sequel to the original NES Zoids game and also features characters from the Zoids model-kit toy series from Tomy (now Takara-Tomy). Zoids 2 also features the same developer/publisher combo of Micronics and Toshiba-EMI.[CR]As with the first NES Zoids, Zoids 2 is an RPG of the Dragon Quest variety that switches to first-person shooter battles when fighting other Zoids. The world of Zoids 2 is still every bit as incongruously medieval as the first game's world.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Special Name Password[CR]Enter the Japanese syllables "su-ko-tt-to" as your name. You'll start the game with far higher stats than normal.</plot>

				<title_clean>Zombie Hunter</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Developed by Lenar, the same developers behind the much derided Deadly Towers, Zombie Hunter is a straightforward action RPG. It was developed for MSX and NES and although it was never released outside of Japan there do exist English language fan translation patches.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player simply walks left to right, occasionally bumping into random encounters from set amounts of enemies. Defeating all the enemies grants the player a chest, which will often contain nothing but money and experience but occasionally also an item.[CR]Items need to be selected and used from the menu before the player character receives any benefit from them. They tend to fall into two categories: Consumables and equipment. Consumables disappear after being used, often recovering the player character's hit points in the process. Equipment, when used, are taken to a separate area of the screen to indicate that they are currently being worn. They tend to imbue additional benefits such as added attack damage and protection. After gaining enough experience, the player character will go up a level and achieve additional stats in that manner as well.[CR]Occasionally the game will allow the player to select one of two paths, each leading to a different set of areas and enemies. This is the only instance where the game allows the player to take a course other than simply moving towards the right.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Change Title Screen Colors[CR]To change the colors on the title screen into one of eight palettes, shout into the microphone on Controller 2 while holding B on it.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Timers[CR]Hold A, B &amp; Start with the combination of Up to enable a Counter, Down to enable a Game Clock, Right to enable a Timer and Left to enable a stopwatch and power off and on your console. If done right, the game will boot up with a grey screen where you can change the time and press A to see it.</plot>

				<title_clean>Zunou Senkan Galg</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Zunou Senkan Galg ("Brain Battleship Galg"), referred to as just Galg by the game's title screen, is a vertical-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player must navigate a serious of canyon-like environments for missing pieces to a war machine. Each stage has at least one piece, so the player must visit them all in order to find the necessary number. In addition to this, there are numerous secrets hidden throughout the many stages of the game, and the player frequently has to choose between multiple paths which lead to different stages. The game advertises itself as a "RPG" on its box art, referring to this additional layer of complexity.[CR]Like The Tower of Druaga, it is considered a historically important game in Japan for the amount of secrets and mysteries it contains and the subsequent difficulty involved in reaching the end without this hidden knowledge. Therefore, it was one of the earliest games for the Famicom to feature its own printed game guide for players to follow. Zunou Senkan Galg is almost entirely unheard of outside of Japan, however, and has never seen a release outside of its native country.[CR]Though it was published by dB-Soft, the game was developed by a group named "Team Bioteckers". Galg is their only known video game credit.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Invincibility[CR]At the title screen, press A, A, Down, Left, Right 3 times, B, Up 4 times and then Start. If done right a sound should be heard.</plot>
