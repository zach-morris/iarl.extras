<rom name="plugin://plugin.program.iarl/Emulator/MAME_2003_ZachMorris/Game/Donkey+Kong+%28US+set+1%29" size="22302"/>
<plot>Donkey Kong (c) 1981 Nintendo of America, Incorporated.[CR]Export version for North America. For more information about the game itself, please see the original Japanese upright version entry.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Blue Upright model] [CR]The blue uprights (which are the most common), are a very rectangular affair, with quite a lot of artwork. They have orange-ish sticker style side-art (with Mario and Kong on them), with control panel, marquee, and monitor bezel graphics to match. This game does not use a standard arcade monitor. It requires a 'Nintendo Compatible' monitor (a normal monitor will display the picture like that of a photographic negative). This simple little monitor change basically launched the entire Nintendo Vs. Unisystem later on. Because only Donkey Kong series games and Vs. titles would work on these monitors (forcing operators to buy conversion kits for those games instead of a competitors game). [CR][Red Upright model] [CR]The red upright versions are actually "Radar Scope" cabinets that have been factory-converted to Donkey Kong. These are fairly rare and feature slightly different gameplay.[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Donkey Kong was released in July 1981 in the USA.[CR]Donkey Kong was to be Nintendo's first big breakthrough into the western - and particularly American - arcade scene. Before Donkey Kong, Nintendo was having difficulty establishing itself in these markets. After the game's massive success Nintendo quickly established their headquarters of Nintendo of America to ensure that the game was being distributed properly. [CR]Mario was named after Mario Segale, the landlord of Nintendo of America's first warehouse location in Seattle (though it was debated whether this occurred before or well after the game was released). Mario was originally called 'Jumpman'; only the arcade version of Donkey Kong has ever called the hero Jumpman; most home coversions, particularly the NES version, game him the Mario name.[CR]Accounts differ as to how Nintendo of America felt about the game before its release. Many sources claim that they all felt sure it would be an absolute disaster while others say they were more optimistic.[CR]Although Mario is a plumber in later games, his career in Donkey Kong is that of a carpenter. Mario's appearance (and consequently his career) was dictated by the primitive graphics hardware of the time - the only way to have his arms appear 'separate' to his torso was to have them as a different color - hence he wears 'dungarees'. The mustache is present merely to indicate where Mario's mouth is, again due to the low graphics resolution imposed by hardware limitations. Mario wears a hat so his head is distinguishable from the game's black backgrounds. [CR]About 60,000 units were sold in the US. Oddly, despite it being one of the ten best selling games of the golden age of video games, it never reached #1 on Replay's popularity charts. Instead, it was stuck at #2 behind mega hits "Pac-Man" and "Ms. Pac-Man" - the two best selling games ever. [CR]Donkey Kong inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Do The Donkey Kong' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. [CR]A Donkey Kong unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', the 1984 movie 'Gremlins', the 1985 movie 'The Heavenly Kid', and the sitcom 'Two and a Half Men' (Season 5, Episode 2 - People Who Love Peepholes). [CR]MB (Milton Bradley) released a board game based on this video game (same name) in 1982. Save the girl and avoid the barrels and fireballs as in the video game. The gameboard is laid out like the video game's Ramp Stage. 'Can You Battle Donkey Kong and Save the Fair Maiden?'. [CR]Donkey Kong also spawned a cartoon series of the same name : Ruby-Spears Productions. Produced by Joe Ruby and Ken Spears. Originally aired September 17, 1983 as part of 'Saturday Supercade' on CBS. Mario was voiced by veteran voice actor Peter Cullen, while Donkey Kong's voice was provided by the late actor/comedian Soupy Sales (1926-2009). [CR]Michael Jackson used to own this game (Blue Upright model). It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24, 2009.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The original Japanese version had all four stages displayed in their original, logical order 1-2-3-4.[CR]For this US version, they changed it to match the 'How High Can You Try/Get?' theme, with the stage order as follows : [CR]L-01 : 1-4 [CR]L-02 : 1-3-4 [CR]L-03 : 1-2-3-4 (as in all levels of the Japanese version) [CR]L-04 : 1-2-1-3-4 [CR]L-05 : 1-2-1-3-1-4 [CR]L-06 through L-21 all remain the same as L-05 [CR]L-22 : 1 (Kill screen).[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

<plot>Vs. Super Mario Bros. (c) 1986 Nintendo.[CR]Classic and cult horizontal platform game featuring the Nintendo mascot Mario who must save princess Toadstool (Princess Peach in Japan) from Bowser (Koopa in Japan).[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Vs. Super Mario Bros. is most common in a converted "Donkey Kong" or "Donkey Kong Junior" cabinet (this game was only available as a kit, there were no dedicated cabinets made). Actually, any copy of this game that is not in a converted Donkey Kong series cabinet is incorrect (as the Vs. kit was only designed for those cabinets). Nintendo designed a special small joystick for their Vs. Unisystem games (allowing a 2 player setup on the tiny Donkey Kong control panel). Another difference between this title and most standard games was audio that was processed in the monitor (although this was the same as most other early Nintendo titles). One other notable thing about this title is that either joystick will control either player (most Vs. titles were like this), making it rather pointless to have 2 sticks in the first place.[CR]Main CPU : Zetex N2A03 (@ 1.789772 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Zetex N2A03 (@ 1.789772 Mhz), DAC[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 256 x 240 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 64[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in April 1986.[CR]Basically, this is the arcade port of the Nintendo Famicom "Super Mario Bros.". There are slight differences:[CR]* Item placement in the '?' and hidden blocks differs slightly, so if you're used to the Playchoice-10 version you may find a few different and unexpected items in certain familiar places.[CR]* Parts of levels were also changed slightly, too, the most noticeable being a gap in the ceiling bricks on the way to the Warp Zone in World 1-2.[CR]* This seems to make the World -1 trick impossible to do on Vs. Super Mario Bros., as it involved the use of these removed bricks.[CR]* More enemies added in most levels[CR]* Bug fixes / preventions.[CR]This game is also known as "Vs. Mario's Adventure".[CR]A hack of this game where made by Two-Bits Score and is known as "Skate Kid Bros.".[CR]Michael Jackson used to own this game. It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on Apr. 24th, 2009.[CR]A Vs. Super Mario Bros. unit appears in the sitcom 'Two and a Half Men'; Season 5, Episode 2 (People Who Love Peepholes).[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Increase The Number Of Marios By 100 Or More : There is a way of increasing the number of Marios by more than 100. At the end of World 3-1, when Koopa Troopa comes on the block stairway just before the flagpole... and reaches the lowest step, jump on him to make him stop moving.[CR]* The 999 Timer Bonus Trick : This one can be done on any of the -4 Worlds. It is most difficult to achieve on World 6-4 and World 7-4. What you do is try to end the level with the timer at 000, and the machine will act as though you have 1000 units of time instead of 0. It will drop to 999 and count down to 000 from there and award points for each unit of time. Simply jump to the axe as the timer goes from 002 to 001 and you should finish the screen with the timer at 000 and get the maximum bonus.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Designed by video game legend : Shigeru Miyamoto[CR]Music &amp; sound by : Koji Kondo[CR]</plot>

<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mario Bros. is the first in a long line of Mario Bros. titles, although its differences from the later games are significant.[CR]Comparison to other Mario Games[CR]Mario Bros. Firsts[CR]Mario - initially called Jumpman - was introduced in Nintendo's first Donkey Kong video game. There, his only offensive ability was the hammer which, like Pac-Man's power pellets, were limited in number and duration. Here, Mario has an ongoing offensive power, one that he would use throughout the sequels, that of jumping under a thing that is standing on a ledge above. While this is usually an optional attack in the later games, for Mario Bros. it's vital for finishing a given stage. Punching underneath a monster flips it over or changes its color (in lieu of flipping it over). Only when upside down is a monster safe to touch. Should Mario touch a monster, he actually boots it into the water at the bottom of the screen, scoring points and defeating the enemy. Other firsts which would find their way into later Mario Bros. titles:This game was the first appearance of the iconic turtle enemy called the Shell Creeper, later dubbed the Koopa Troopa. Mario could not, however, jump on their backs as he could later, even though the Shell Creepers and Koopa Troopas look nearly identical.Shining sewer pipes, too, made their first appearance. This time they serve as monster dispensers, and reminders that game takes place in a sewer.Many things fall into the sewers, including baby turtles which grow up to be Shell Creepers, but another iconic thing that might get lost in a storm drain is a coin. Thus, coins are brought in as extra scoring items every time an enemy is killed. If Mario picks them up before they reach the bottom of the screen, the player gets extra points.The POW block, used to flip all the monsters over who are currently standing on a surface, is later employed in other Super Mario games (though its "zapper-like" abilities are changed).Fireballs also make an appearance, looking a bit more like the fireballs Mario and Luigi throw when they've picked up a flower in Super Mario Bros., but fireballs in this game are enemies.And last, but not least, the simultaneous two-player mode introduces Luigi, a swapped-palette Mario.Elements Unique to Mario Bros.[CR]Many elements in Mario Bros. did not get picked up for later installments of the Mario Bros. series. Other enemies, such as the hopping Fighter Flies, ice-patch creating Slipice blobs, and crabby Sidesteppers are seen nowhere else. Neither is the complex punching-under-then-hopping-up-to-kill-the-monster mechanic, although there are certain situations in later games where this is a viable tactic. Touching an enemy when it isn't supine brings instant death, and possibly the most notable difference is that the game is largely defensive. In Donkey Kong before it, and all Super Mario games after, Mario as a player character is largely the mover, moving the game from scene to scene. Here Mario and Luigi defend territory until they win - the scenery eventually changes, but only slightly.[CR]</plot>

<plot>This is a puzzle game based on the Nintendo character Mario. The Princess has invited Mario and Luigi to a picnic in the Mushroom Kingdom. But when the Mario Brothers arrive, they learn that King Bowser Koopa is making over the kingdom into his personal resort and the princess has been kidnapped, again. [CR]Mario and Luigi must stop him and rescue the princess by closing doors in the hotels.[CR]Most hotel stages have 10 levels, other stages have less, others more. You close doors by pressing button 2. Enemies will come through some doors and will try to open doors to prevent you from succeeding. You can jump on some enemies by pressing button 1.[CR]Behind some doors, you will find a mushroom that will allow you to take a hit without dying. If you already got a mushroom, you will find a fire flower that will allow you to shoot fireballs by pressing buttons 1 &amp; 2 simultaneously. This will take out some enemies easier and other enemies can only be defeated with the fireball.[CR]When you reach the top level of your current hotel, you will need to close the doors here while avoiding one of the Koopalings. Once you succeed, there will be an animated FMV cutscene then it is off to the next hotel (stage).[CR]All the stages are plays on real hotels, like Morton's WoodDoor-Hysteria Hotel, Roy's HardBrick Hotel, Lemmy's High-ate Regency Hotel, Bowser's Seizures Palace Hotel, etc.</plot>

<rom name="plugin://plugin.program.iarl/Emulator/Colecovision_ZachMorris/Game/Donkey+Kong+%28USA%2C+Europe%29" size="9253"/>
<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The First LevelThe arcade classic Donkey Kong rose out of Nintendo's desire to crack into the United States arcade market. The company's president back in 1981, Hiroshi Yamauchi, made the decision to take a Nintendo arcade release called Radar Scope (a hit game in Japan that floundered in the States) and see if it could be easily retrofitted to play a different, and hopefully more successful, game. To accomplish this task, Yamauchi chose a young employee named Shigeru Miyamoto.The basic story of the game is that Donkey Kong is Jumpman's pet. Jumpman mistreats Donkey Kong, who snaps and kidnaps Pauline and, in a decidedly King Kong-like twist, takes her up a building under construction. Jumpman must navigate four different levels, climbing to the top to either force Donkey Kong to move on or, in the stunning final confrontation, bring the building's girders down to make the big monkey fall.Donkey Kong was followed-up by Donkey Kong Jr. , which puts the player in the role of Donkey Kong's son, Donkey Kong Jr., who must attempt to rescue his father from the clutches of the evil Jumpman, who by then had already been renamed Mario. [CR]Development[CR]The Second LevelUpon going to work, Miyamoto's first attempt was to make a game based on the then-popular Popeye character. The licensing deal was not pursued by Nintendo, though the company would later secure the license and develop a popular Popeye arcade game. Miyamoto had to retrofit his concept and develop three characters with similar relations to Popeye, Olive Oyl, and Bluto. He came up with a little man with a mustache that was quickly named Jumpman, who had to save his girlfriend, Pauline, from the evil gorilla named Donkey Kong. After designing the concept Miyamoto approached his more colleague Gunpei Yokoi who would assist the young designer by supervising the technical development of the project.Unfortunately due to the technical limitations in place not all of Miyamoto's ideas for the game were able to be included as concepts such as incorporating seesaws into the game or having the characters expressions more defined and animated were unable to be incremented into the game. These technical restrictions would ultimately have an effect on the character design of Jumpman as he was forced to make the character small whilst still making him look human. As such Miyamoto thought it best to give the character distinct features,"such as giving him a big nose. We gave him a moustache so that we didn't need to draw a mouth, as it's often difficult to show facial expressions with small characters. We also gave him big hands."The name Donkey Kong was ultimately the decision of Miyamoto too. Wanting to give the impression of a stubborn, stupid gorilla he thought of animals which he thought were dim-witted and stubborn he came up with the idea of 'Donkey' which he believed to mean stupid. He also wished to incorporate the word 'Kong' into the title which in Japanese gives the idea of apes. Putting the two together the end result was "Donkey Kong". [CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The Final LevelDonkey Kong helped to create the platformer genre, and also was one of the first to include a story. Donkey Kong changed the way people played games; no longer was it just about high scores, gamers began to play the game to find out what would happen next. Donkey Kong became one of the most iconic video games of all-time and a huge part of American pop culture, gaining mentions on countless television shows, songs, and movies. Donkey Kong also essentially launched Nintendo's biggest character of all-time, Mario.As a testament to the legacy of Donkey Kong, the documetary King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters was released in 2007, 26 years after the game's debut. The film was about gamer Steve Wiebe and his journey to defeat Billy Mitchell's high score, which had stood for 25 years. Public awareness about the competition for this score was raised by this film, and in the years since Wiebe, Mitchell, and others have traded positions on the top spot. Read more about the documentary at the official site.In July 2009, Donkey Kong made news yet again when a 26-year-old easter egg, which did nothing more than display the initials of Landon M. Dyer, who worked to code the title, was uncovered after Dyer mentioned that he had forgotten how to display the initials and offered $75 to whomever can find the Easter egg first. The $75 was awarded to Don Hodges after he dug through the game's code and found the way to display the initials.[CR]Donkey Kong: Original Edition[CR]In 2010, a special version of the NES release of Donkey Kong was available to those in Europe who purchased the special Super Mario Bros. 25th anniversary Wii. This version, subtitled "Original Edition", restored the missing "pie factory" stage as well as some animations. Although still not arcade-perfect, it was still much more than any edition released on the NES.This edition of the game would not release in Japan or the United States until 2012, and only then, on the 3DS. In Japan, it was a pre-order bonus for New Super Mario Bros. 2. In The States, it is a bonus gift for players that purchase the digital download versions of Art Academy: Lessons For Everyone!, Paper Mario: Sticker Star, Professor Layton and the Miracle Mask, Style Savvy: Trendsetters, or Crosswords Plus before January 6, 2013. It was made available to everyone for purchase on the European 3DS eShop on September 18, 2014.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The first console port was licensed by Nintendo but not made by them. A near perfect arcade port, and pack-in, was created for the ColecoVision system. This propelled its sales over the Atari 5200 and sold 500,000 units at launch. Over a year later Coleco made a version for its rival's Atari 2600. Sega was also planning to release a version with Coleco.Falcon was licensed to distribute the game in Europe, which it did so with modified graphics and the name "Crazy Kong" (this is often mistaken to be a bootleg game). They did the same with the sequel Donkey Kong Junior, as Crazy Kong Jr./Crazy Junior. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Lose Your Hammer Power[CR]In the ''ramps'' level, if you have hammer power and you would like to get rid of your hammer power without having to wait for it to wear out, just kill a few barrels and move to the edge of a ramp, then drop to the ramp directly below. You will not lose a life, but your hammer power will magically vanish! [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Lose Your Hammer Power[CR]Move Mario up the first broken ladder on the ''ramps'' level, then climb back down. Walk to the left and position Mario so that his back is almost touching the same broken ladder. Then, move him one or two steps to the right and jump. If done correctly, Mario will fall through the bottom and appear in the ''rivets'' level or re-appear after several seconds on the top ramp next to Donkey Kong. Note: This only works on some versions of the cartridge. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Climb ladders faster[CR]To make Mario climb a ladder faster get him to start climbing up or down a ladder, stop climbing, then climb again up/down again. Mario will climb the ladder faster.</plot>

<plot>Mario has kidnapped Junior's Papa![CR]Donkey Kong Jr. was originally released in the arcades in 1982 as a sequel to Donkey Kong.  In this game, Mario plays the antagonist, finally having captured Donkey Kong, and has put the ape in a locked cage.  As Donkey Kong Jr., players will have to make their way through four different levels (Vines, Springboard, Chains and Mario's Hideout) in an attempt to find keys to free the little monkey's Father.[CR]Along the way, Mario will send out Snapjaws, swooping purple birds, and electric sparks in an attempt to stop Junior.  Junior can defend himself by dropping fruit found around the levels on the heads of his foes.  The more foes a piece of fruit hits in a falling sequence, the higher bonus points can be scored.[CR]Junior can also avoid enemies more easily by grabbing hold of two chains or vines at a time to climb away faster, or by jumping over his foes.  However, any long fall or falling into the water on certain levels will mean the loss of a life for Junior.[CR]In the final cut scene, Junior will free Donkey Kong and both will escape after giving Mario the boot.  Once all four levels are cleared, the game levels will start over at a higher difficulty.[CR]Like the original Donkey Kong, the earlier 1980's console versions do not have all of the levels and animations from the arcade.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Avoid all enemies[CR]During the Second Level in the Second Round, stay on top of the vines and it will be impossible for the birds to hit you.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Avoid all enemies[CR]Position Donkey Kong Jr. directly under a dirt section on the ''pelicans'' level. Climb all the way up to the dirt, then move him left, right, and left . At that point, move Donkey Kong Jr. left, right, and left again, you will climb straight through the dirt section! </plot>

<plot>Game &amp; Watch Panorama Screen: Mario's Bombs Away is the fourth game in the sixth series of Game &amp; Watch games published by Nintendo, also known as the Panorama Screen Series. With it's tilt-able screen, this series managed to offer the same experience as the Table Top Series, but on a much more portable format and for a more affordable price. Of the six titles in the series, three were re-editions of previous Table Top Games. Mario's Bombs Away isn't one of the re-editions of the Table Top Versions which were released before, but a new game in the G&amp;W franchise. The player controls Mario transporting bombs from one side of the screen to the other. Whilst moving, enemies in the trees above try to light the fuse. To avoid the possible explosion, one must press the up/down button, allowing you to lower the bomb to hip level, dodging the ambush from above. The ground you traverse on is riddled with multiple oil puddles and carelessly thrown away cigarette ends from your comrades. As in Turtle Bridge the person collecting the bombs from Mario does so on a irregular basis.</plot>

<plot>Released in the arcades in 1981, Donkey Kong was not only Nintendo's first real smash hit for the company, but marked the introduction for two of their most popular mascots: Mario (originally "Jumpman") and Donkey Kong.Donkey Kong is a platform-action game that has Mario scale four different industrial themed levels (construction zone, cement factory, an elevator-themed level, and removing rivets from girders) in an attempt to save the damsel in distress, Pauline, from the big ape before the timer runs out. Once the rivets are removed from the final level, Donkey Kong falls, and the two lovers are reunited. From there, the levels start over at a higher difficulty.Along the way, Mario must dodge a constant stream of barrels, "living" fireballs, and spring-weights. Although not as powerful as in other future games, Mario can find a hammer which allows him to destroy the barrels and fireballs for a limited amount of time. Additionally, Mario can also find Pauline's hat, purse and umbrella for additional bonus points.Donkey Kong is also notable for being one of the first complete narratives in video game form, told through simplistic cut scenes that advance the story. It should also be noted that in many conversions of the original coin-op game for early 1980's consoles and computer-systems, Donkey Kong only used two or three of the original levels, with the cement factory most often omitted.</plot>

<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga was released in North America on November 17, 2003. It was developed by  AlphaDream and published by  Nintendo. It marked the return of  Mario RPGs to portable consoles. Like many other Game Boy Advance Mario games at the time, Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga also has an option to play the original  Mario Bros. (with updated graphics). Gameplay is very similar to that of  Paper Mario and Super Mario RPG, as well timed button presses allow the player to inflict more damage and reducing or countering enemy attacks. The game was granted a sequel,  Mario &amp; Luigi: Partners in Time, but it was criticized for not being as interesting or  humorous as its predecessor.[CR]In sprite-ripping communities, Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga is well-known for its colorful, cartoon style. The way the sprites are outlined (with small gray dots in certain locations) is also one of the style's key features.[CR]Unlike previous adventures, Superstar Saga takes place in the  Beanbean Kingdom. While certain parts of the game are located in the more familiar  Mushroom Kingdom, the action and story all takes place in the Beanbean Kingdom.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A battle early in the game[CR]The game introduced a new series of moves called  Bros. Moves in which Mario and  Luigi attack as a team, when performing a Bros. Move players will relay on the amount of Bros Points (BP); the higher the BP the stronger the attack also the degree of difficulty of the move is determined by the amount of BP as a higher number required a more complex button combination. Mario and Luigi cooperation is also used outside of battles as the work together to solve different  puzzles. As in any other role-playing game, in Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga players boost power by  leveling up, in which several  stats increase by each level gain, some of these stats include attack, speed and defense. Players can also improve their stats by collecting different items like clothing and badges.[CR]In the overworld, the game differs from a traditional RPG in many aspects. The ability to jump and solve puzzles is one that is more commonly seen in action games, but (being the Mario brothers), these abilities are in place. The overworld gameplay is very similar to the SNES RPG  Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, a game from which Superstar Saga derives many of its gameplay aspects. Many of the puzzles in the overworld focus on the cooperation between the brothers; having the player take them on separate paths on several occasions.[CR]Interestingly, Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga is one of the few Game Boy Advance games to use the rumble option when placed in the Game Boy Player on the Nintendo GameCube.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The Goodwill Ambassador[CR]The game begins with the Goodwill Ambassador from the Beanbean Kingdom (as well as his assistant) arriving the Mushroom Kingdom to present a gift for  Princess Peach from the ruler of the Beanbean Kingdom,  Queen Bean. However, it turns up to be an attack by  Cackletta, an evil witch, and her quirky assistant  Fawful. Fawful uses his headgear to steal Princess Peach's voice and replace it with a rather "explosive" (literally) vocabulary. Our heroes, Mario and Luigi, are at  their house when  Toad runs up screaming for help. Mario quickly gets ready to go to the castle, but doesn't realize he is dragging Luigi by the clothesline.[CR]When he reaches the castle,  Bowser is there (who was attempting to kidnap Princess Peach, but couldn't because he was afraid she would blow up  his castle every time she spoke). Mario comes to a quick stop, and Luigi flies off the clothesline and hits Bowser. Bowser challenges Mario to the first "boss battle" of the game. After the battle, Bowser agrees to assist the brothers in getting back Princess Peach's voice.[CR]The first order of business is to go to the Beanbean Kingdom. Mario and Bowser are going to leave in the Koopa Cruiser, along with all of Bowser's  minions. The Koopa Cruiser is about to fly off, when Luigi comes to say goodbye. Bowser thinks that Mario's brother is one of his minions, so he grabs him and puts him into the Koopa Cruiser. While the three are on the deck of the ship that night, they spot an unidentified object flying their way. It ends up to be Fawful and Cackletta, and Cackletta orders Fawful to stop them. Bowser gets taken out, but the brothers easily destroy Fawful's headgear, rendering him useless. Unfortunately, he still manages to destroy the Koopa Cruiser and it crashes on the Beanbean Borderlands.[CR]The brothers head into the building containing the Border Bros., who guard the border between the Mushroom and Beanbean Kingdoms. Mario and Luigi are given a  map of the Beanbean Kingdom, and are granted passage into the Stardust Fields. Eventually, they locate Bowser who is stuck in a cannon owned by Tolstar, the self-proclaimed king of Stardust Fields. He wants coins to free Bowser from the cannon. As the brothers are searching for coins, they encounter the Starshade Bros., who teach them Bros. Moves. When they give Tolstar the coins, however, he attacks. The brothers defeat him but due to a misconception, Bowser is fired out of the cannon.Hoohoo Village[CR]As Mario and Luigi continue, they enter Hoohoo Village. Here, they find Fawful again, who blocks their path to the Beanbean Castle by placing a boulder in their path (that can only be destroyed with a  hammer). The Hammerhead Bros. live in Hoohoo Village, and they are willing to make hammers for the brothers if they can find a Hoohoo Stone on the top of Hoohoo  Mountain. They accidentally wake up Blablanadon in the process, however, who has been sitting on a large  egg for some time (without knowledge of what the egg contains). When the egg hatches it has the Dragohoho in it. After the brothers defeat it, it turns out that Cackletta had  transformed the Beanbean Kingdom's hero,  Prince Peasley, into that monster. Prince Peasley gifts the brothers with a special rose, which will allow them to enter the castle. The brothers go back down the mountain, gather their hammers, and continue on their quest to Beanbean Castle.Beanstar[CR]When the duo make it to Beanbean Castle Town, it is evident that Cackletta has staged a recent attack. They hurry to the castle, where the rose grants them entrance, and meet with Queen Bean's head adviser, Lady Lima. She doesn't believe that the two are the famous Mario Bros., so she asks that they fix the castle's  sewer. While fixing the  pipes, Mario and Luigi discover the real Lady Lima, as well as some servants. They rush upstairs, where Cackletta had just succeeded in taking the Beanstar (a wish granting star), and sends Queen Bean to attack them. Having been transformed by eating a Belly Blech Worm, Mario and Luigi go to find the only known cure: Chuckola Cola.[CR]The Château de Chucklehuck is the only location in the Beanbean Kingdom where Chuckola Cola is brewed. There, the brothers encounter "master thief"  Popple, and his sidekick  Rookie. After easily disposing of them, the brothers find Cork and Cask, the owners of the château. After teaching the brothers new out-of-battle Bros. Moves, the duo uses these newfound moves to gather Chuckola Fruits to grant them access to the Mother Chuckola. The creator of Chuckola Cola, Bubbles, is in there, telling jokes to the soda, the rare Chuckola Reserve. He sends his creation to attack the brothers, now the Chuckolator. After defeating it, Mario and Luigi got it back safely to Queen Bean, where the antidote is applied. She instantly transforms to her normal self.Woohoo Hooniversity[CR]Prince Peasley flies in to report that Cackletta has made a lair of some sorts in Woohoo Hoonivesrity, so naturally it is the brothers' job to investigate. After finding Cackletta and Fawful about to use Peach's voice (through the use of Peach Bots) to activate the Beanstar. However, it causes the Beanstar to explode with anger, destroying the Peach Bots. Just then, Mario and Luigi jump in. They beat Cackletta to a pulp, which is when Fawful absorbs her spirit into his headgear. When he is about to fight the brothers himself, Prince Peasley sweeps in and knocks Fawful off into Stardust Fields.Rookie[CR]Meanwhile, the brothers find Popple and Rookie, who are trying to steal the Beanstar. They are defeated by Mario and Luigi yet again, but after the battle a Peach Bot falls through the ceiling and irritates the Beanstar again. It flies through the ceiling, with Mario, Luigi, Popple, and Rookie intact, launching them into four directions and breaking the Beanstar into four pieces. Mario and Luigi land on an island in the Oho Ocean, known as Oho Oasis, where they learn Firehand and Thunderhand. They make it out of the Oho Ocean and go to the Beanbean International Airport, where Princess Peach is due to fly in. When Peach lands, it is revealed that her voice was never actually stolen, and that Birdo was disguised as Peach. Princess Peach decides to visit immigrant Toads while she is in the Beanbean Kingdom, in the town of Little Fungitown.[CR]To get there, they have to travel in Teehee Valley, which is inhabited primarily by monsters. Mario and Luigi, however, manage to escort Peach to Little Fungitown in safety. As the duo is exploring the village, Mario manages to win an Invincishroom, which gives him Bean Fever, a condition which will slowly transform him into a Beanish (the species that are the primary inhabitants of the Beanbean Kingdom). Luigi travels to the Guffawha Ruins (after being hypnotized into thinking he is Mario) and gathers the Crabbie Grass, the only known antidote for the Bean Fever. On his way back to the hospital, however, Cackletta attacks (in Bowser's Koopa Clown Car) and kidnaps Peach. Luigi quickly revives Mario, and the two race back to the castle.[CR]It ends up that when Peasley launched Fawful, he landed in the Stardust Fields. Rookie landed here as well (it is revealed that he is an amnesiac Bowser). Fawful puts Cackletta's spirit in Bowser, forming Bowletta. Back at the castle, everyone is gathered. They are surprised by the new state of things, and suddenly they receive a ransom message from Bowletta. She wants the Beanstar in return for Princess Peach. Prince Peasley bets the brothers 99,999,999,999 coins that he will find the Beanstar shards first.S.S. Chuckola[CR]The first Beanstar shard is located in the Teehee Valley on the ship S.S. Chuckola. The ship is filled with skeletal sailors, as the ship was sunk many years ago, before the desert dried up. The brothers manage to fill the area up with water again, but as soon as the ship makes it to the Oho Ocean, it sinks. The Beanstar floats out of the ship, and Mario and Luigi follow it to Gwarhar Lagoon. The duo get new abilities from the Jellyfish Sisters here. They find the Beanstar as an ornament on Hermie III. The brothers battle Hermie III, and get the Beanstar shard back.[CR]The remaining three shards don't take quite as long to find. One is found with a stylist named Harhall, another is located in the Yoshi Theater and is collected from Boddle after the brothers get all of the Neon Eggs for him, and another one is in the Chucklehuck Woods, at an area known as the Winkle Colosseum (where Popple tries to steal it, but fails). Back at the castle, Lady Lima has another message from Bowletta. Bowletta wants the brothers to bring the Beanstar shards to Joke's End. Prince Peasley had the idea to try and trick Bowletta and Fawful with a Fake Beanstar. They make it to Joke's End, where a girl named Jojora appears. She calls Joke's End her "playground." They eventually find Jojora and defeat her and her friends.Fake Beanstar[CR]After making it to Fawful, Fawful sees right through their Fake Beanstar ploy. He stole the real Beanstar, but Mario comes up with a plan. Toadsworth had given the brothers an extra dress for Princess Peach. Luigi puts on the dress and pretends that they have the fake Princess Peach. Bowletta falls for the ruse this time, and tosses the real Princess Peach out of the Koopa Clown Car, and takes the fake Princess Peach to the Koopa Cruiser. Luigi in the Koopa Cruiser, manages to recapture the Beanstar and escape.[CR]Luigi lands in Teehee Valley, and sinks in a sand pit. Mario goes to investigate, and finds him underground, tied up. Popple jumps in with his new "Rookie," Birdo, who has fallen in love with Popple. They beat him and Birdo, and head back to Beanbean Castle Town. Bowletta has attacked the town again, this time leaving it in shambles. She is using Bowser's Castle to attack, which floats in the sky. Mario and Luigi go to Blablanadon in Hoohoo Village to ask him to fly the brothers up to the castle. Once in the castle, the brothers defeat all of the Kooplings, many of Bowser's and Cackletta's minions, and eventually Fawful. After defeating Bowletta, the brothers are brought down to incredibly low health, and Bowletta sucks them in, where they fight Cackletta's spirit. Luckily, the brothers escape the castle before it explodes. The Beanbean Kingdom is free of Cackletta, once and for all.CharactersFawful[CR]The game has many unique--and humorous--characters scattered throughout it. The main protagonists, of course, are the titular brothers: Mario and Luigi. They remain silent throughout the entire game, conversing only through comical motions. Bowser is not the main antagonist in this game, instead being a helpful character (until his inevitable possession). Cackletta, the main antagonist, is a witch who is determined to gain world domination. Her sidekick, Fawful, is one of the most humorous characters in the game, known for his use of the phrase, "I HAVE FURY!" and such nonsensical lines about condiments. Also encountered on several occasions is a thief named Popple, who is usually attempting to steal the same treasure that the brothers need for their quest.[CR]Also helping out the brothers is the royal family of the Beanbean Kingdom: Queen Bean (who is turned into a monster by Cackletta) and Prince Peasley (also transformed into a monster). Prince Peasley is somewhat of a celebrity is the kingdom, and one part of the game focuses around an autograph from him. As with all 2D platforming Mario games, the goal is to rescue Princess Peach.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Music from one place to another[CR]Before entering a pipe, enter it with Mini-Mario. During the Pipe-Selection Screen, the music in the previous area you were just in will stay the same. When you warp to your destination, the music in the pipe will now be the BGM until you leave the area/go into pipe while not Mini-Mario, etc.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Music from one place to another[CR]Red Peppers increase your power for a few turns. During the effect, let the effected brother get knocked out. Then, use a 1-UP Mushroom to revive them. The effect will continue for the whole battle and not wear off! This is especially useful against hard bosses.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Music from one place to another[CR]Turn Luigi into a surfboard and surf to the coast on the east side of Beanbean Castle Town.  [CR]Surf in and land on the shore.  [CR]While Mario is dismounting the surfboard, hit a Bob-omb to start a battle.  [CR]When the battle is over, Mario will be frozen in the air, but the pause screen will still be accessible.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Monty Mole-Hunting Rewards[CR]Throughout the game's world, there are a number of yellow Monty Moles in hidden areas. Find them, and perhaps solving the puzzles they may give, will yield a variety of useful items. Below are those items in addition to where, generally, you can find them.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Game references in the Yoshi theater![CR]In the lobby of the Yoshi theater, there are four posters on the wall referring to Nintendo video games:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Game references in the Yoshi theater![CR]1. Kirby Story--referring to the Kirby series[CR]2. Wario poster--referring to the Japanese box art design for "WarioWare, Inc.: Mega Microgames"[CR]3. M&amp;L--referring, of course, to this game (more specifically to the game's originally intended title, "Mario &amp; Luigi")[CR]4. Legend of Stafy--referring to a Japan-only game series of the same name[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Game references in the Yoshi theater![CR]Go to the summet on HooHoo Mountain, walk to the top right of the summet until you get to the edge. There should be a slant in the summet shape (like an octogon)  and two stone sharp-like rocks, walk up to the top one and look underneath the B button icon, you should see Princess Peach's Castle from Super Mario 64.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Discount on Taking Pictures![CR]In the Beanbean Castle area, there is a photographer that will take pictures for your passports for 100 coins. He will ask you to pay 100 coins. Say "No", and he will offer to take them for 50 coins.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Discount on Taking Pictures![CR]During the normal version of the attack "Fire Bros.", try abd count how many fireballs Mario conjures up. Smack the fire back, but be sure to MISS the action command on the last one. You'll do more damage in the last part than normal. You'll want to be pretty precise here, because going too early or late will hinder the total damage done.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Discount on Taking Pictures![CR]When Cackletta divides into 3, use any item, but don't attack. When the Cacklettas attack, you will see one use the left arm only, and right arm, and both arms. Attack the one that uses both arms.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Discount on Taking Pictures![CR]There is an Island Surfing game somewhere near Oho Oasis. After getting 1st prize (Casual Coral), you can fulfill the same criteria and get 2 Hoo, Woo, and Chuckle beans each time! By doing this, you can gain infinite beans and, possibly, infinite stats from blending these infinite beans.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Starbeans Cafe Rewards[CR]After the Beanbean Castle town is repaired, you can enter the northern building on the west side of town. There, you can take the various beans dug up from "X" marks on the ground (among other means) to make a number of drinks that increase your stats. In addition to this, every time you make a brand-new drink, you'll get a particular award!</plot>

<rom name="plugin://plugin.program.iarl/Emulator/GBA_ZachMorris/Game/Mario+Kart+-+Super+Circuit+%28USA%29" size="2168997"/>
<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The title screen for the game.[CR]The sole title of the acclaimed kart racing series to show up on the Game Boy Advance, Mario Kart Super Circuit once again pits the Nintendo characters against one another in a frantic battle of item tossing and speed boosting to reach the finish first. This game is the third title in the Mario Kart series, preceded by Mario Kart 64 and followed by Mario Kart: Double Dash!! on the GameCube. This games features and combines the elements from the previous games in the series. The game was released on July 21 in Japan, August 27 in North America and September 14 in Europe. Super Circuit is also the first game in the series to be on a handheld.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As with most racing games the goal is to finish first. All of the races within the game have eight characters to play with. In the game, the player can pick up items which are contained within item boxes. For the player these items are very useful however the AI-controlled players can also use the items against the player. Coins are dropped onto the course so that players can speed up to their top speed for the character. If a player has 0 coins and comes in contact with another racer they spin out of control.[CR]The game contains five different cups. Each cup has four different race courses. These cups are called Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup, Lightning Cup, Star Cup and Special Cup. If a player had collected 100 coins within a specific cup they could unlock the Extra Cup. This cup contained extra cups from Super Mario Kart, the first game in the series. With these courses added in, this game had contained the most courses within any other game in the series. If a gold trophy was collected with a Cup the title screen would change to a sunset. If there are three star ratings on all the cups for each engine class, the title screen would change to night and be accompanied with a new tune.Racers[CR]LightweightToadPrincess PeachYoshi[CR]MiddleweightMarioLuigi[CR]HeavyweightDonkey KongWarioBowser[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]This game has four different game modes. All of these modes were accessed by a single player expect for the battle mode. In battle mode four players could participate using a "Game Boy Advance Link" cable with the cartridge. But all players that would be using the single cartridge mode would only be limited to selecting from four courses from Super Mario Kart and can only use Yoshi and different colors of him.[CR]Grand Prix[CR]In the Grand Prix mode, a single player or two players would race against the AI. The player chooses a Cup and the fours courses to play within the Cup. The player earns points by finishing in the first four positions of the race. If the player finishes in fifth or lower then the player must restart the race. The player can restart the race up to three times before they are unable to restart the race again. If two players are playing the game moves onto the next race if one player finishes in the first four places. At the end of the Grand Prix, the player with the most points will win.[CR]Time Trial[CR]Players can race to get the best times on each course without any obstacles After achieving a best time they can save ghost data onto the trial course. Players are given three mushrooms each to use during the time trial.[CR]Quick Run[CR]This mode is a one player mode unique to this game. Players can race on any the tracks within the game without any restrictions or regulations. Players can alter the number of laps, appearance of coins and item boxes by pressing select before accessing the mode.[CR]VS Mode[CR]Up to four players can race against each other without any AI controlled opponents on any course.[CR]Battle Mode[CR]Up to four players are given three balloons and must use items against other opponents to take them out. Once all three balloons are lost, the player loses. If there are more than two players, the player is turned into a bomb. Bombs can run into other opponents for damage, and once exploded, they are respawned on the course and can charge at other players until a winner is decided.[CR]Ranking[CR]Depending on the players performance in the Grand Prix they will achieve a rank. This can include "Triple Star" being the highest rank to "E" the, lowest rank.[CR]Tracks[CR]Mushroom CupFlower CupLightning CupStar CupSpecial CupPeach CircuitMario CircuitLuigi CircuitSnow LandLakeside ParkShy Guy BeachBoo LakeSky GardenRibbon RoadBroken PierRiverside ParkCheese LandCheep-Cheep IslandYoshi DesertBowser Castle4Bowser Castle1Bowser Castle2Sunset WildsBowser Castle3Rainbow Road[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Speed Boost![CR]When you have a Mushroom Turbo boost Power up and you are about to go on a Spring Ramp, Use you're Turbo Boost power up, If you use it JUST BEFORE you go on the ramp/spring You can go much further and faster.  [CR]This works on just about every course with a spring/boost on it, but I don't think it is very effective on massive red and yellow ramps...[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Speed Boost![CR]Once you have an Item and it is scrolling to decide which one you get press ''L'' a few times and the scrolling will stop so you get the Item twice as fast![CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Speed Boost![CR]On the Player Select screen, press L to make the rotating image of the character you put the cursor on shoot a green shell straight ahead. You can also press R to make that character jump. Do this as many times as you please, it's just a little trick to try if you want.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Speed Boost![CR]As in Mario Kart 64, you are able to power slide in this game as well! To perform a power slide, press and hold R to hop while holding Left or Right. When you land, you'll slide in the direction you were holding. After about 2 seconds, let go of the R button and stop sliding. When you drive straight, you'll be given a boost, which is the result of a power slide. It may take a little bit of practice to pull it off, but it helps when trying to get around hairpin turns, or if you want to cut a couple seconds off your time when racing in Time Trial mode.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Speed Boost![CR]When you run straight into a Banana or another hazard, you'll notice your kart goes off balance before spinning out totally. To get back on balance before spinning out, release the acceleration and press the brakes (you must do this before you actually spin out, or else it'll be worthless). If you did it correctly, you'll see a music note appear above your character's head, showing you pulled it off successfully.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Speed Boost![CR]If you fall off the track or get stuck underwater for more than a couple moments, Lakitu comes to pull you out and place you on the track again. When he picks you up, wait until just before you touch the track again, then press the acceleration and you'll get a turbo boost if you timed it correctly. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Speed Boost![CR]To get a turbo boost to give you a head start in the race, do not press/hold the acceleration button before the race. Wait until just before the final light appears, then hold down the accelerator If you time it correctly, you'll be shot ahead, giving you a quick start!</plot>

<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The title screen for Mario Party Advance. (Normal)The game's title screen, with coins in the background.[CR]Mario Party Advance is the eighth game in the Mario Party franchise (including Mario Party-e). It was released for the Game Boy Advance on January 13, 2005 in Japan, on March 28, 2005 in North America, and on June 10, 2005 in Europe. The game was developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo. Due to the limited memory on a Game Boy Advance cartridge, the gameplay of Mario Party Advance differs from the Nintendo 64 and Nintendo GameCube iterations. The game takes place in Shroom City, where the goal is to collect all of the minigames and Gaddgets that were scattered by Bowser. Mario Party Advance was met with generally low reception, with the Metacritic average at 54%.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Due to the limitations of the Game Boy Advance, there are far fewer playable characters than there were in previous Mario Party games. The only playable characters are Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, and Princess Peach. This game marks the second appearance of the host, Tumble, who was also in Mario Party 3. Other non-playable characters include Shroomlock (a renowned detective), Mr. E (a mystery-lover), Mushbert (a fan of Toad Force V), and Mrs. Shroomlock (Shroomlock's wife).[CR]Mario Party Advance plays similarly to other Mario Party games, but due to it being on aMario Party Advance Screen[CR]handheld system, it does have differences. The game no longer has a four-player multiplayer mode that has been in almost all Mario Party games. However, players can download minigames or Gaddgets to other Game Boy Advances, as well as play Duel minigames with one another. The game was packaged with a "Bonus Board," which was a physical board game that allowed people to play against each other.[CR]Gaddgets are a new feature in Mario Party Advance. They are developed by Professor E. Gadd. Gaddgets can be gathered by completing one of the game's many quests in the Shroom City mode, playing a Koopa Kid minigame, or purchasing one in the Challenge Land mode. Gaddgets are essentially short minigames.[CR]Minigames[CR]Single player minigamesBoo-ByeGrabbitChomp WalkerCloud ClimbBarrel PerilBig PopperForest JumpSwitch Way?AmplifiedFlingshotSpooky SpikeBob-OOOM!Reel CheepShell StackBill BounceBunny BeltPest AsideMelon FolleySort StackOn the SpotKoopa KrunchFloor It!DreadmillStompbot XLGo-Go PogoSled SlideFlippin' OutSee Monkey?Outta My Way!Broom ZoomDuel minigamesTank-DownHammergeddonStair ScareChicken!Chain SawVolleybombKoopa KurlSlammerOther minigamesMatch 'emWatch 'emDrop 'emStop 'emPair 'emMush RushCrushed IcePeek-N-SneakSplatterballTrap FloorKoopa Kappa[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Bowser games in Party and Challenge Lands[CR]Beat Bowser's final quest to unlock the following:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Bowser games in Party and Challenge Lands[CR]To unlock any of the following Game Modes, do so in Shroom City.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Change alternate title screen[CR]To change the title screen, buy a poster gaddget in challenge land that has the title background you want.

<rom name="plugin://plugin.program.iarl/Emulator/GBA_ZachMorris/Game/Mario+Pinball+Land+%28USA%2C+Australia%29" size="5129533"/>
<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mario Pinball Land is a portable pinball game starring Mario. It plays somewhat similar to  Kirby's Pinball Land in that it takes place on several different pinball boards containing interconnected single-screen areas that Mario can travel in between. To complete the game, Mario must defeat every single boss to collect a Star Key, which he can then use to proceed through the final board to a battle with Bowser.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]They don't look very trustworthy   [CR]Mario, Peach, and some Toads are at the Fun Fair screwing around with a cannon-like machine that turns people into pinballs. Some Goombas sneak up while Peach is in the machine and fire her into Bowser's Castle. It's up to Mario to once again save Peach, this time in the form of a pinball![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]There are five different boards for Mario to travel through:Funfair - Where it all goes wrong. Bounce around circus attractions and confront Big Boo in the haunted house.Snowy - The game's ice stage. The boss is a Cheep Cheep.Grassy - A standard field stage.  Petey Piranha is the boss.Sandy - A desert stage, look out for Pokeys and Lakitus. The boss is Tutankoopa, an ancient Egyptian Koopa.Firey - Bowser's Castle, a fight with the Koopa King himself awaits at the end.Petey Piranha is always in a good mood.[CR]To progress through every board to reach the end, Mario must collect stars. To collect stars on a board, Mario can complete different tasks. These tasks generally involve destroying all of the enemies on a screen, although the behavior of these enemies tends to vary. Once the player has collected enough stars, they can pass through the star doors to gain access to the boss fight. Defeating a boss will earn Mario a star key, all four are required for him to unlock the doors in Firey and reach Bowser.[CR]Each stage also features a red switch. Hitting it will release eight red coins onto the stage, which Mario can then collect for another star. Once he does this the switch will be replaced by a red question mark block. Hitting the block will give Mario a red Yoshi Egg.Items[CR]Items can be used to help Mario on his journey. They are either found in question mark blocks or bought from Toad. They do many different things, such as doubling the size of the pinball or making it harder to let it pass through flippers. The different items are:Mega Mushroom: Doubles the size of the pinball. Bees!Mini-Mushroom: Shrinks the pinball. Nessecary to enter some pathways.Pipe: Springs up between the flippers to make it harder for Mario to fall through them.Star: Makes Mario invincible. This destroys any enemy Mario comes into contact with.Thunderbolt: Destroys every enemy on screen.Yoshi Egg: Essentially adds a second pinball. Dropping it through the flippers will not cost a life.Red Yoshi Egg: Only obtainable if Mario hits the red switch after collecting all of the red coins for a star. Combines the effects of the Yoshi Egg, Mega Mushroom, and the Star.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Special Ending[CR]Get all thirty-five stars and receive a different ending.</plot>

<description>Game Boy Advance - Mario vs. Donkey Kong (USA, Australia)</description>
<rom name="plugin://plugin.program.iarl/Emulator/GBA_ZachMorris/Game/Mario+vs.+Donkey+Kong+%28USA%2C+Australia%29" size="6943209"/>
<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Donkey Kong is watching television when a commercial for the new Mario toy comes on. He likes this toy so much that he is willing to steal to get what he wants. He raids a toy factory and escapes, but Mario witnessed Donkey Kong's crime. This sets Mario on an adventure to save the toys made in his likeness.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mario vs. Donkey Kong brings back the gameplay from the classic arcade game. It takes an even greater influence from the Gameboy game titled Donkey Kong. The levels have the classic construction site level designs. The levels have player using platforming skills, but the levels are essentially puzzles. Mario will have to retrieve a key somewhere in a level, and the key opens up a door in the level. The player will have to think and skilfully use platform his or her way through a level. Puzzle elements enter the game also in levels where Mario collects mini marios. The mini marios will have to be led through a level, and be put into a toybox. After you collect mini marios you enter a boss stage where you face Donkey Kong with the mini's help. Depending on how many you rescued they will act as a health bar for Mario during these boss encounters. Each boss features Donkey Kong in which you generally throw barrels or objects at him. As you progress through the game many bonus levels will eventually be opened.First the key then the door[CR]Once you've beaten the 6 worlds and defeated Donkey Kong the player can enter plus mode where you play 6 new worlds (but with the same themes). In plus mode (or plus worlds) the game plays a little different, the key is now attached to a mini Mario who Mario must guide through the enemies and traps. The level is completed once Mario and his Toy clone are both standing before the goal door. Also unlike normal mode, plus mode only has one area each level. Once the player completes all six plus worlds you face of DK in the true final battle.[CR]The worlds in this game are:Mario Toy CompanyDonkey Kong JungleFire MountainSpooky HouseMystic ForestTwilight City[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Crown trophies[CR]The crown trophies appear over your file after completing certain tasks.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Crown trophies[CR]View these movies in the Visual Options menu after unlocking them in the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Crown trophies[CR]Beat the first world to open Expert World, then collect stars to gain new levels.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Crown trophies[CR]After beating the 1st 6 worlds, and the end Donkey Kong boss, you'll unlock 6 new PLUS worlds.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Crown trophies[CR]You will also unlock the option to choose EXPERT at the main menu.

<rom name="plugin://plugin.program.iarl/Emulator/GBA_ZachMorris/Game/Super+Mario+Advance+%28USA%2C+Europe%29" size="2158269"/>
<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Mario Bros. 2 received an enhanced remake as Super Mario Advance, the first Mario title for the Game Boy Advance, which also contained a remake of Mario Bros. This version was developed by Nintendo R&amp;D2. It included several graphic and sound enhancements in the form of enlarged sprites, multiple hit combos, and digital voice acting. For the first time ever on Nintendo's part was a system devised to score this game. Two notable additions are the new character, Robirdo, a robotic Birdo who acts as the boss of the third world, and the Yoshi Challenge, which encourages players to revisit stages and search for Yoshi eggs. Nintendo's decision to choose it as the Game Boy Advance launch game was seen by some as misguided; GameSpot in particular thought that Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World would have been a far better choice for a launch title considering their popularity. (Both of those titles would eventually be remade as part of the Advance series.) However, IGN praised the choice, calling it "one of the most polished and creative platformers of the era." Nonetheless, it was a best-selling launch game, showing that the game still appealed to Nintendo fans. Recently, the game has become part of the Player's Choice lineup for Game Boy Advance as one of the system's first three Player's Choice games (along with Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga and Super Mario Advance 3 ).[CR]Before starting a level you can choose between Mario, Luigi, Toad, and Peach. Each of the characters have different strengths and weaknesses such as Luigi who can jump high though not very far and Toad is faster. As well as strength which determines how quickly the character can pull up a item in the ground.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Change the Green Yoshi to red at the title screen[CR]Get all 100 A coins in the game, and at the title screen, the Green Yoshi/Egg will turn Red (you must beat the game first to see the egg).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Change the Green Yoshi to red at the title screen[CR]In Mario Brothers, for every 200,000 points you get, a small Mario Head will appear next to your Mario Bros. high score on the game selection screen. You can get up to 4 stars maximum (800,000 points), as your point counter stops at 999,990.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 99 Lives[CR]Go to World 3-3. Climb the ladder then jump over the spark enemies to the door over on the ledge. Find the red grass patches; the last one is a shell. Pick it up. Go back to the bottom of the area, and then toss the shell into the doorway. Stand on the ledge and wait. After the shell defeats enough Shy Guys to earn 1,600 points, you'll start earning extra lives. You can easily, and quickly, earn up to 99 lives.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 99 Lives[CR]When you get to the green Birdos jump on her head and press B to pick her bow up. Birdo will be bald!!! If you throw the bow back at Birdo it will land back on her head.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 99 Lives[CR]For every 2 million points you get in Super Mario 2 game, you get a little Mario head next to the High Score! The maximum is 10,000,000 points / 5 heads. Any more points will NOT get more heads.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 99 Lives[CR]If you're ever in need of hearts, look for one of those giant Shy-Guy enemies. Jump on it, pick it up, then throw it on the ground again. A heart will come out for you to collect. You can do this an infinite number of times to the same giant Shy-Guy, too.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 99 Lives[CR]To gain an extra life in any level, collect all 5 Red Coins scattered throughout each level.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 99 Lives[CR]In world 1-3 after you get the magic bottle/potion go all the way to the right until you reach the vase thing. Use the magic bottle/potion, jump on the vase and go down. Instead of not being able to go down you'll now be warped to world 4-1.  [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 99 Lives[CR]Go to level 3-1. Go to the waterfall and go down. Keep going until you reach the hill, go in the door on the hill. Pull up veggies until you get a potion. Go to the right and place the potion next to the pot. Enter subspace and go into the pot. You will be warped to the 5th world. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 99 Lives[CR]In the begining of level 4-2 jump down onto the whale and go to the left. You will find some red grass patches which will have a potion. Carry the potion through the entire stage, and rather than go through the door, you can jump on the last whale's tail and jump over a small gap to find a vase. Now drop the potion, enter the door and go down the vase.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 99 Lives[CR]Go to world 5-3 as Luigi. After you climb the first ladder,  power jump (hold down until you are glowing) on to the platform you normally can't reach. Pull up the plant on the right side of the warp pot. Throw down the bottle and go through the door. In the dark world,  jump on top of the pot and go down. You should see the screen wiggle and it will say warp world 7 on a screen with Birdo.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 99 Lives[CR]After defeating Wart in World 7-2, you unlock a special Yoshi Challenge game on that file. It allows you to replay any stage in search of two Yoshi Eggs. Unfortunately, it gives no description of the kinds of areas the eggs could be hidden. The eggs are hidden in Subspace, but the searching for the egg is the challenge. Also, if you lose a life, you lose all of your eggs as well.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] 99 Lives[CR]To get Yoshi on the title screen, beat the game on Yoshi's challenge and instead of an egg,there will be a Yoshi.</plot>

(Example: Vanilla Dome 2 or Star World 1)Make sure you have a feather equipped. Use your cape to roate the blocks, then stand in right in front of the blocks while they are rotating. Usually the blocks will just push you back into open when they stop moving. However, sometimes the blocks will push you the opposite direction- into the wall. This usually works only in Vanilla Dome 2, but it allows you to walk down the slope of the wall underneath enemies. However, if you are surround by layer after layer of bricks (Star Road 1), you will be pushed into the other blocks, usually resulting in you losing a life.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Earn Point Stars (Mario Brothers)[CR]For each 150,000 points you get in Mario Brothers, a star will appear at the top of Mario Brothers at the game selection screen (where you pick between Super Mario World and Mario Brothers).

<rom name="plugin://plugin.program.iarl/Emulator/GBA_ZachMorris/Game/Super+Mario+Advance+3+-+Yoshi%27s+Island+%28USA%29" size="2597514"/>
<plot>When Baby Mario falls from the sky, the big-hearted Yoshis vow to reunite him with his twin brother on the far side of the island.It won't be easy, but you must help them take on a meddling Magikoopa and his entire cast of underhanded underlings.Your journey spans the island's jungles, caves, and snowcapped peaks--each area filled with hidden rooms, secret passages, charming minigames, demented bosses, and all-new pals.Sure, Yoshi looks cute, but he packs some pretty amazing firepower--he can throw eggs, hover, stomp, pound the ground, slurp up enemies, and morph into a toy submarine.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alternate Title Screen[CR]Simply beat the game 100% and the next time you boot up yoshi's island the game's title screen will show yoshi's island but it will be night instead of day[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alternate Title Screen[CR]To append stars next to the logo at the game's title screen, you must complete every single level in a given world: this includes the extra levels earned by getting 100 points on the other eight levels in the world. One star will appear for each world completed in such a manner, for a total of up to six stars at the title screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Alternate Title Screen[CR]Collect a certain amount of points in a world to get a special surprise. (Note: the first three apply for all 6 Worlds.)[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get 6 NEW Secret Levels[CR]Beat the game to get a whole new set of 6 levels not found in the original Yoshi's Island.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get 6 NEW Secret Levels[CR]After you have gone over all the hills there is a pipe that Shy Guys come out of. Ignore them and go past the pipe and get  rid of the Killer Plants in the next two pipes to the right (one above and on the ground). A Kooper is walking between the two pipes on the ground. Jump on the Kooper and send his shell spinning between the two pipes. Shy Guys continue to jump out of the pipe on the left and every time the Kooper shell hits them you will hear a different sound that means youre getting lives! Stand on the pipe on the right and the lives will continue for as long as you stay on this screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get 6 NEW Secret Levels[CR]In any World, whenever you get your World Score to 777, you will earn 7 lives.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get 6 NEW Secret Levels[CR]When entering the arena, do not pass the end of the stone colonade that is at the very edge of the large arena room. This will allow you to see the small pirhanna plant without activating the boss battle.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get 6 NEW Secret Levels[CR]From here, you can fire an egg at the pirhanna plant and destroy it with one hit. This forces Kamek to appear and say 'OH MY', before fleeing. Having already destroyed the plant and scared Kamek, you will not have to fight the Naval Pirhanna, thus avoiding a potentially difficult boss battle.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get 6 NEW Secret Levels[CR]Grab a Melon Bug (the creature that rolls up into a ball) and go to the pipe with Shy Guys jumping out of it. Spit the Melon Bug close to the pipe on the left-hand side. When Shy Guys jump out, after a while you will get a "1-Up" for each time a Shy Guy hits the Melon Bug when it is in its melon form.</plot>

<plot>Bowser is back, and along with the Bowser kids, he's out to spoil Mario's day once again.[CR]This time, along with nabbing the Princess, the Bowser crew have also taken the magic wands from the Kings of each land and turned them into creatures. It's up to Mario and Luigi to get back the magic wands, defeat Bowser, and save the Princess all before the day is done.[CR]Old and new power-ups abound in each level for the Mario Brothers, including the return of the Super Mushroom and Fire Flower, plus the new power-ups including the frog suit, the warp flute, and the most important of all, the leaf, which allows you to fly and attack enemies with your tail.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/gameboy-advance/super-mario-bros-3[CR]</plot>

<description>Game Boy Color - Super Mario Bros. Deluxe (USA, Europe)</description>
<rom name="plugin://plugin.program.iarl/Emulator/GBC_ZachMorris/Game/Super+Mario+Bros.+Deluxe+%28USA%2C+Europe%29" size="351267"/>
<plot>[CR]The Original Super Mario Bros.[CR]Super Mario Bros. Deluxe is nearly identical to the original Super Mario Bros. experience on the NES. None of the levels were modified in any way from the original set, at least when played through the first time. New to this version, you can save anytime onto one of three separate accounts and there are simple overworld maps depicting each of the eight worlds. As a new feature, the Photo album is comparable to a modern Achievements system, awarding small pictures or vignettes that can be printed on a Game Boy Printer. Also, the game now includes a battery pack powered leaderboard, making the points system from the original game matter. The Gameboy Color's screen is not as wide as that of the original NES's display, so developers compensated for this by allowing the player to go back a short distance, press up or down to look around or press Select to recenter camera. Those points aside, the game is a dead ringer.[CR]Star Mode[CR]When you finish the original game the first time, a new star designation goes beside your save account and the game starts over with some variations to make the game more difficult. For example, in star mode, all of the Goombas are replaced with Buzzy Beetles and all floating platforms are considerably shortened. The effects of this mode do not consistently increase the difficulty (unchanged enemies pose no more a threat than before) but completion does prove much more challenging for platforming-intensive stages. When you beat the game on Star Mode, the game lets you choose which level to play and on what mode in the account selection screen.[CR]Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels[CR]Other than the main game, the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2 (aka The Lost Levels) is in this release, named Super Mario Bros. For Super Players. To access the levels, you have to beat the default high score in the leaderboards that are held by Luigi in the main game. The format of Lost Levels is nearly identical to the original Mario Bros mechanically and graphically but it is designed to be far more difficult than its predecessor (it's also much more difficult than Star Mode). In addition to demanding better timing and greater levels of finesse, the game actively tries to trick the player with bogus secrets and red herrings, the most notorious of which is a warp zone that takes the player back to World 1 from later Worlds. Lost Levels is also the relatively obscure debut of the Poison Mushroom which will harm Mario when touched. As with the Super Nintendo version, the game removes the final 9th and A to D worlds, and differences in gameplay between Mario and Luigi.[CR]Challenge Mode[CR]One of the new modes is a challenge mode where each of the original 32 levels have special items hidden in them for Mario to find. The player can choose any level they have beaten on a save in the original game. Challenge Mode has three goals for each level: finding five special red coins, finding the Yoshi egg, and achieving a score by the end (determined by the development team). There is only one Challenge Mode account and it can be reset if desired.[CR]You vs. Boo[CR]Another new mode is a versus mode either against Luigi or Boo in a race to the flag. This can be done either as a singleplayer to two-player game with a link cable. The objective is to dodge a level full of obstacles, traps, and hazards to beat your opponent to the flag. There are eight levels to choose from and though they are graphically similar to the original game, none of the level designs are taken from the original. Each map has a series of buttons that players can hit to change the status of certain blocks, altering their existence or spikiness. There are two states the buttons toggle and one is beneficial to each contestant, striking a balance between making sure the layout is ideal and just gunning for the flag.[CR]Boo is your opponent when playing against the computer and he simply floats by at a constant rate in the background instead of being blocked by obstacles, making these much more of a race against the clock than the multiplayer version. However, the computer will switch the state of the blocks in the level at a fairly constant rate, so this danger is not averted.[CR]Toad's Toy Box[CR]Every time the player makes significant progress in a mode or in the original game, things open up in Toad's Toy Box. The calendar, is just a basic calendar showing the current date, but goes on from 1 AD to 3000 AD, and has some filled out dates such as the original Japanese release date for Super Mario Bros. The fortune teller just shows a random item and a small fortune text like a fortune cookie, and occasionally a Super Fortune, awarding 5 extra lives in all games. The "?" room gets filled with Toads as you rescue them in the game, playing out little animations and unlocking more pictures printable via the GameBoy Printer. The last ones open up a simple music creator similar to Mario Paint, and you can redo the iconic opening music. "Where's Yoshi?" section is a randomized hint machine that will choose random levels and show the approximate location of the Yoshi Egg in them for Challenge Mode.[CR]Secrets[CR]Start a game with 10 lives instead of 5[CR]To start a game with 10 lives (new file), go to the toy box, and select the fortune teller option. Now pick a card. Keep on picking until you get an "Extremely Lucky" card, and you should see a 5-Up on the card.[CR]now you can start a game with 10 instead of 5 lives.[CR]</plot>

<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dr. Mario is a puzzle game developed by Nintendo R&amp;D1 and published by Nintendo. The game was originally released on the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy in 1990. It has since seen many sequels and remakes, such as Dr. Mario &amp; Puzzle League on the Game Boy Advance and Dr. Mario Online RX on WiiWare. The soundtrack was composed by Hirokazu "Hip" Tanaka.[CR]According to the instruction booklet, Mario is now working as a doctor in the virus research lab at the Mushroom Kingdom Hospital. As usual, Dr. Mario is about to begin his research when Nurse Toadstool informs him that several viruses are out of control and spreading quickly. Mario exclaims "Oh No! We've got to do something! I have just developed a new vitamin that should be able to take care of it. I sure hope this stuff works!"[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in Dr. Mario[CR]Dr. Mario is a puzzle game that uses much the same falling block mechanic made ubiquitous by Tetris. Vitamin capsules are dropped into the play field and must be rotated to remove viruses hovering at fixed spots (each half the size of a vitamin.) The vitamins are colored one of three colors on each side (red, yellow, or blue,) and the colors of the vitamin must be matched with the corresponding viruses of the same colors. After stacking up four of the same color, the virus is eliminated. After destroying all viruses on the playing field, the player progresses to the next level.[CR]The player can select 21 different levels (0 to 20), and players who can clear level 20 can make it all the way to level 24 (clearing 24 just repeats this level continuously). Each level has a different amount of viruses, and in level 20 there are 84. No more than 84 can fit, making each level after 20 have 84 viruses as well. The player can also select the background music, either Fever or Chill. The game speed can also be set to low, medium, or high.  The more time spent clearing a particular level, the faster the game speed will gradually become. [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hidden Super Mario Bros music[CR]Destroy four or more viruses at once and the  hidden tune will play.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Epilogue Animation[CR]Complete Level 20 on any difficulty to view the epilogue animation[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Epilogue Animation[CR]Finish the following Virus Levels on the corresponding Speed setting to view a special animation: [CR]Level 05  - Hi  [CR]Level 10 - Hi [CR]Level 15 - Hi [CR]Level 20 - Hi</plot>

<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mario's platforming adventure, now in the palm of your hand![CR]Super Mario Land is a 2D sidescrolling platformer developed and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy on July 31, 1989. A handheld successor to Super Mario Bros., it is one of the launch titles for the Game Boy, developed with no input from series creator Shigeru Miyamoto (instead developed from Game Boy creator Gunpei Yokoi's R&amp;D1 devision).[CR]Players control hero plumber Mario as he ventures through the four tropical kingdoms of Sarasaland to rescue Princess Daisy (and the hypnotized inhabitants of the lands) from mysterious space monster Tatanga.[CR]The game would receive a direct sequel in 1992, titled Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, which vastly improves upon the platforming aspects of the original while adding a new adversary, Wario (who would play as the protagonist in the series spin-off, Wario Land). Tatanga returns in this sequel (as a boss), while Daisy later becomes a regular in Mario spin-off games (starting with Mario Tennis). Super Mario Land was later released for the Nintendo 3DS (via Virtual Console) on June 6, 2011.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Super Mario Land is a standard sidescrolling platformer (in similar vein to Super Mario Bros.) where players must guide Mario through 12 levels (split into four unique areas, called "Worlds"), to reach each level's goal (at the rightmost part). Players move Mario using left and right on the d-pad, while holding the "B" button to run and hitting the "A" button to jump.[CR]Like Super Mario Bros., Mario is vulnerable to touching most enemies and their projectiles. If he gets hit once (while not powered-up), falls off the level, or gets trapped in automatic side-scrolling stages, he loses a life and must restart the level. If the player loses all of his lives, then he must either use a continue (and restart the level with three lives and no score) or end the game with a game over. Mario can knock out most enemies by jumping (or falling) on them, gaining points by doing so.[CR]Scattered around all levels are coins which can be collected by touching them. Coins can also be found by hitting certain boxes (scattered around levels) from below. For every 100 coins collected, the player earns an extra life. For every 100,000 points earned, the player earns an extra continue.[CR]The end of most levels contain two exits, one of which is located at the top of the screen and is more difficult to access. If Mario reaches the higher exit, then the player is rewarded with a mini-game in which players can earn a Fire Flower power-up or up to three extra lives.Power-ups[CR]By hitting certain boxes (scattered around levels), players can find special power-ups which grant Mario special abilities.Super Mushroom - Transforms Mario into Super Mario, giving him a taller stature while allowing Mario to get hit once without losing a life.Fire Flower - Only appears if Mario is Super Mario. If Mario is no longer Super Mario before touching one, it automatically applies the Super Mushroom power-up. Mario also has the ability to throw "superballs" (by tapping the B button), which bounce off surfaces and knock out most enemies.Starman - Grants Mario temporary invincibility (as indicated by a change in background music and Mario's clothes flickering). Mario can still lose a life by falling off the level or getting trapped in automatic side-scrolling levels.VehiclesIn some stages, Mario can pilot a personal vehicle, such as the Marine Pop above.[CR]In certain levels, Mario pilots a personal vehicle in an automatic side-scrolling level. While in the vehicles, Mario moves around the stage with the d-pad while shooting torpedoes or missiles with either A or B buttons.[CR]During these levels, the screen scrolls right automatically up to the level's boss battle. If Mario gets trapped between the left edge of the level and an object, he automatically loses a life and must restart the level.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]The game has 12 stages, all split up into four themed "worlds". The player progresses through each world in order, defeating a boss at the third stage of each world.Birabuto Kingdom - An Ancient Egyptian-themed world. The second stage takes place on top of giant palm trees while the third stage takes place inside a pyramid. The boss of this world is King Totomesu, a large sphinx creature that jumps and spits fireballs at Mario.Muda Kingdom - A water-themed world. In the third stage, which is underwater, Mario pilots his personal submarine (the Marine Pop). The boss of this world is Dragonzamasu, a large seahorse creature that swims around and spits fireballs at Mario.Easton Kingdom - An island-themed world. The second stage takes place in a cavern. The boss of this world is Hiyoihoi, a moai head creature that throws large rocks at Mario.Chai Kingdom - An Ancient China-themed world. In the third stage, which is in the sky, Mario pilots is personal aircraft (the Sky Pop). The boss of this world is Biokinton, a cloud creature that throws flying birds at Mario. After defeating it, Tatanga appears with his spacecraft as the final boss fight.[CR]By clearing all twelve levels, players can replay the game in "Expert Mode", where enemies are moved around in each stage to make the stages more difficult. Clearing the harder levels allows players to replay any of the game's levels.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Expert Mode[CR]When you beat the game, press any button while you're on the title screen. The cursor will change from a mushroom to Mario's face. Press Start to play the new Expert Mode that features enemies that are more difficult, more numerous, and in different places.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Expert Mode[CR]Normally, during the invincibility granted by the Star, each enemy you knock off the screen will be worth 100 pts. However, when you pump a Super Ball into an enemy that is worth 400 or 800, each enemy the Star kills after that will be worth the same amount! This works with torpedoes (submarine) and missiles (airplane) as well. With enemies that require more than one projectile to be slain, one hit is still enough to get this trick to work.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Expert Mode[CR]If you go through stage 1-3 normally there will be coins and pipes on the top of the stage that you can't access. To access them you need to activate two secret elevators.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Expert Mode[CR]The first one is right at the start of the stage. Position Mario exactly three blocks away from the left side of the screen. Jump and lean against the wall and there's your first elevator. Stand ontop of the block and don't move. You will go straight through the top blocks and Mario will be on the top of the screen where your stats are.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Expert Mode[CR]The second elevator is at the second lion. Kill the lion and dodge the two falling stones. There will be a row of five blocks that go in a pattern of coins and bricks. Break the second brick with Super or Superball Mario. Jump through the hole you just made and the second elevator will appear. There will be no coins this time, but it will lead you to a secret pipe. In expert mode a plant enemy will be there so watch out.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Expert Mode[CR]In level 2-2, when you see a tall line of vertical coins near a pipe and a Nokobon, get hit so you shrink (if you're Super or Superball Mario).  Ahead of you are two levels, but the lower one seems out of reach.  There is an invisible floor that makes it accessible, but you must be Little Mario to walk across it.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Expert Mode[CR]Beat the game two times in a row, then keep pressing A. Pressing A after completing the game twice in a row activates a Stage Select. The more times you press A, the higher the stage you can go to. [CR]</plot>

<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]I'll bet you didn't know Mario had a castle, did you?[CR]While Mario is away in Sarasaland, Wario arrives at Mario's castle and takes over. Wario put's an evil spell over Mario Land, making the inhabitants think that Wario is their leader. He then seals the door of Mario's castle and takes the six golden coins that hold it shut and scatters them across the land. The objective of the game is to get all six coins and enter the castle to confront Wario.[CR]This is the first game in Nintendo history to feature Wario, that lout.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game generally plays like any Mario platformer would, with some interesting exceptions. Mario proceeds from left to right in his search for the exit to the next stage. Once he reaches this exit, he will discover a bell hanging above it. To reach this bell usually takes some extra effort, but if he manages to ring it he will be taken to a mini-game where he can earn powerups and extra lives, assuming he doesn't accidentally walk off the screen before he's awarded the prize.Bunny Mario, we hardly knew ye. Note kill counter and coin counter that exceeds 99 coins.[CR]New to the Mario series, and never seen again afterward, is Bunny Mario. After eating a Super Carrot, Mario transforms into Bunny Mario and can glide by twitching his ears up and down. Bunny Mario cannot fly technically, he can only slow his descent as Bunny Mario, similar to the glide effect given by the racoon and tanooki suits in other SMB games. Why this change was never later used is unknown, but at least you get to ponder how rabbit ears could possibly help Mario take to the skies.[CR]Mario selects worlds from a map, taking each world on in any order. The map has six different zones, each with 3-4 levels in them. There's the Tree Zone, Space Zone, Macro Zone, Pumpkin Zone, Mario Zone and Turtle Zone.[CR]In an interesting change, instead of a 100 coin counter, the coin counter goes up to 999, and doesn't roll over to zero or give you extra lives. The coins are used in a special zone where you play a game of chance to try to win awards, including fire flowers, bunny ears, extra lives, recovered coins, and a booby prize in the form of a witch, who gives you nothing. it is also possible to accidentally pick up more witches in certain areas, and these witches will be added to the minigame board, increasing the chance that you'll get nothing for the coins you risked.[CR]There is another counter, which goes up to 99, but this is a KILL counter, and when THAT reaches 100 kills, you are awarded with an invincibility star no matter where you are in the stage. This can potentially lead to more extra lives if you can kill enough enemies in combination before the invincibility runs out, and because it can occur anywhere on the stage, it can suddenly be very helpful in getting past certain areas (or it can be all but useless, depending on your timing).[CR]Another interesting fact is that this game is one of the few Mario games to feature a multi-stage boss that takes a total of more than 3 hits. In a sense, it's a combination of 3 successive bosses that total 9 hits, creating a bit of tension when you realize that you have a ways to go before you win.[CR]Zone Overview[CR]Turtle Zone - Consists of three water themed levels. When Mario first enters the zone he gets swallowed by a giant turtle. The boss at the end of the zone is an octopus.[CR]Mario Zone - The zone looks like a giant toy Mario. Its four levels have a toy theme to them. The bosses at the end of the zone are The Three Little Pigs.[CR]Pumpkin Zone - All four of the levels feature a scary theme. The zone looks like a giant pumpkin. The boss at the end of the zone is a witch.[CR]Space Zone - This zone consists of three space themed levels. To get to this zone you must first beat a level that looks like a giant hippo on the map screen. In these levels, gravity is much lighter and Mario's jumps take him much farther. He also wears a space suit in all of the levels. The boss at the end of the zone is the alien Tatanga, the final boss from the first Mario Land game.[CR]Macro Zone - For this zone Mario shrinks to a small size while he enters a normal house. It consists of four levels. The boss at the end of the zone is a giant rat.[CR]Tree Zone - This zone consists of four levels set in a gigantic tree. All the levels are tree based on different parts of the tree. The boss at the end of the zone is a crow.[CR]Final Zone - This zone takes place inside Mario's Castle which has been warped to suit Wario's needs. The boss at the end of the zone is Wario himself who must be defeated three times. The first time he attacks he runs back and forth across the screen and slams into the ground dropping a light from the ceiling to try and hit you. After three hits, he escapes off screen. He then attacks as Bunny Wario. In this form, he leaps to the top of the screen and flys back and forth while slowly descending before slamming into the ground dropping the light and freezing you in place for a second or two. After another three hits he escapes one final time. He then transforms into Fire Wario. He attacks by running back and forth and shooting fireballs at you. After the final three hits he turns into Baby Wario and is defeated.[CR]3DS Version[CR]It was announced for a Q4 2011 release on the 3DS Virtual Console.[CR]</plot>

<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wario Land is the spiritual successor of  Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins, and as such takes the successful formula of that game, switches in a new protagonist, improves upon the graphics and adds an extra layer of gameplay depth thanks to the inclusion of bizarre power-up hats. Wario's gameplay style is brute force mixed with elements of timing (namely jumps) and deductive reasoning. The Wario scheme of dealing with a problem is typically to barge it out of the picture in exchange for a few coins, in addition enemies can be picked up and thrown to take out other enemies or for accumulation of yet more coins.[CR]The game's levels are spread throughout a large island which is divided into a number of smaller areas in a similar way to Mario Land 2 and within these areas the individual levels are arranged in a linear path with a boss fight lying at the end. While Mario Land allowed players to tackle its areas in any order Wario Land features a linear progression throughout, which, while being more constrictive than its predecessor means the game has a much more refined difficulty arc which spans its entirety as opposed to only each individual area.[CR]Graphically, Wario Land is a drastic departure from the Mario titles available for the Game Boy and replaces the shiny and clean-looking sprites which are reminiscent of cartoon strips with grittier and darker ones in line with Wario’s character. The detail is also increased over previous games, with many more pixels dedicated to character models and locations giving the game increased clarity and overall graphical quality. [CR]Power-up Hats[CR]Bull Wario about to attack.[CR]Wario – Standard Wario, will shrink if hit by an enemy.[CR]Bull Wario – Upgraded Wario can cling to ceilings, perform floor stomps and destroy destructible blocks in one hit.[CR]Dragon Wario - A dragon hat enables Wario to shoot flames on dry land and a jet of gas underwater which damages enemies, and destroys blocks from a distance.[CR]Jet – Jet propelled hat lets Wario run faster and fly for short distances. [CR]Game Areas[CR]Rice Beach - Consists of relatively simple platforming levels which feature water and quicksand as environmental hazards. The boss is named Toge Bro. who looks like a standard Koopa with spikes that stands upright.[CR]Mt. Teapot - Mountain and cave based levels. The boss is named Beefine who is a bi-pedal bull.[CR]Sherbet Land - A secret world with ice themed levels where slippery surfaces offer added challenges. The boss is Hinyari, a penguin with spiked boxing gloves.[CR]Stove Canyon - Levels are themed around lava with collapsing bridges and many flying enemies. The boss is Funfun, a giant head with a skull on its forehead. [CR]SS Teacup - A Pirate themed level. The boss is  Bobo, a giant bird.[CR]Parsley Woods - Levels are split between trees and railroad tracks with the former consisting of standard platforming fare and the latter introducing moving train cars which add the difficulty of fighting enemies while avoiding obstacles and staying on the cars. The boss is Zenisukii, a ghost.[CR]Syrup Castle - The final area holds fiendish platforming levels where timing and pixel-perfect jumps are a necessity. Spring blocks add an extra level of challenge by vastly increasing jumping distance. The final boss is Captain Syrup and her Genie Denpu. [CR]Treasures[CR]Once you defeat the boss of the each main area, if you go back to some of the levels, they will be slightly different. There will be new doors that require a key in the level that let you collect one of 15 Treasures. The differing amount of treasures you have collected will determine your "ending". When you defeat the game it counts up the money and treasures you have collected and by how many you've collected you will receive a corresponding house. You can get a Birdhouse, Tree-house, Log Cabin, Pagoda, Castle, or a whole Planet.[CR]Game Credits[CR]Producer - Gumpei YokoiDirector - Kyotake HirojiDirector - Hosokawa TakehikoProgrammer - Yamanaka MasaruProgrammer - Ogawa YuzuruProgrammer - Hirano IsaoProgrammer - Katsuki YoshinoriGraphic Designer - Kyotake HirojiGraphic Designer - Hosokawa TakehikoGraphic Designer - Sugino KenichiMusic Composer - Yoshitomi RyojiMusic Composer - Ishikawa KozueDirector - Kiyotake HirojiDirector - Hosokawa TakehikoProgrammer - Yamanaka MasaruProgrammer - Ogawa YuzuruProgrammer - Hirano IsaoProgrammer - Katsuki Yoshinori[CR] [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Prevent yourself from losing a life[CR]As you progress through a level, if you manage to be killed by an enemy, Wario will move up in the air and then leave the screen. If you pause the screen while Wario moves up in the air, and turn off the game and subsequently restart it, you will be on the same level without a loss of a life.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Six different endings[CR]When you beat the game, the ending depends on how many coins you collected in total.Wario will live in these places, depending on the coin total.Birdhouse - 300-10,071 coinsTree trunk - 10,072-40,007 coinsLog cabin - 40,008-70,007 coinsPagoda - 70,008-90,007 coinsCastle - 90,008-99,998 coinsPlanet - 99,999+ coins[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug menu[CR]During gameplay, pause, and press SELECT 16 times - no more, no less. Press A and press left or right to move to a different digit area. Press up or down to adjust the number of hearts, coins, and lives you have.[CR]After doing the debug menu cheat above, press and hold A and B and select the picture of Wario all the way to the  left and unpause. You will now change:  [CR]Small Wario --&amp;gt; Big Wario --&amp;gt; Bull Wario --&amp;gt;Jet Wario --&amp;gt;Dragon Wario --&amp;gt; Small Wario</plot>

The game was released on both the Nintendo 64 and iQue.Nintendo Puzzle Collection includes a version of Dr. Mario 64[CR]Because there was no Japanese version of Dr. Mario 64, the version of Dr. Mario included in Nintendo Puzzle Collection on the Nintendo GameCube is a port of the North American version of the game. There are a few new things in the game, including new music and secret characters. The game is never referenced to as Dr. Mario 64, but rather Dr. Mario (and any references to the Nintendo 64 in the game itself are removed).[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The flu season is in and seeing as Mario is a doctor, he must help cure the disease with his Megavitamins. But before long Wario steals his Megavitamins and in such causes Mario to go after him, but before Mario can get his Megavitamins back, Mad Scienstein and Rudy the clown steal the Megavitamins from Wario. Mario and Wario set out on seperate paths to get the Megavitamins back for both there own causes they encounter each other and numerous monsters from the Wario Land universe.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dr. Mario 64 plays similarly to other games in the Dr. Mario franchise.[CR]Like any drop down puzzle game, Dr. Mario requires the player to line up certain colors so that the blocks can removed to create more space. To remove blocks, no more than a minimum of four of the same color must be connected to make them disappear. These include the Red Virus (Fever), the Blue Virus (Chill), and the Yellow Virus (Weird); with a Megavitamin color designed to kill them. Dr. Mario 64 includes different gameplay modes these are as follows, Classic mode, which features a similar set-up and design to earlier Dr. Mario video games. Story mode, in which the player may take control of either Dr. Mario or Wario to track down the stolen Megavitamins, battling computer players along the way. Another mode pits the player against the computer as any character the player has played as or fought against. Up to four players may play at once in the multiplayer mode, which is designed similarly to the CPU Vs. mode.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlock Vampire Wario[CR]To unlock Vampire Wario as a playable character in Versus mode, complete Story mode on Normal or higher difficulty using Dr. Mario, but without losing a single time.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Increase Computer Difficulty[CR]When selecting a computer opponent in Vs.

<rom name="plugin://plugin.program.iarl/Emulator/N64_ZachMorris/Game/Mario+Kart+64+%28USA%29" size="9167963"/>
<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The game's title screen.[CR]Mario Kart 64 is a Mario themed go-kart racing game developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64, released in 1996. It is the sequel to Super Mario Kart for the SNES and features characters and track locations from the Mario universe. Mario Kart 64 made the leap from Mode 7 to full 3D computer graphics, which allowed for complex track designs. The characters, however, remain 2-dimensional sprites. The game was a huge success, selling millions of copies and eventually became a Player's Choice title.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Bowser in Mario Kart 64[CR]At its most bare-bones, Mario Kart 64 only requires the player to press the accelerate button to drive and use the analog control stick to control the kart's direction. More experienced players will be able to use drifting and Mario themed weapons and items such as Turtle Shells and Mushroom Boosts to get the advantage over their opponents. Items are scattered in rainbow colored boxes across each track and as the items in each box are random and potentially very powerful, they add a certain level of uncertainty to each race. The drifting mechanic is performed by hopping and turning in mid air which allows a player to take sharp turns without losing speed, and if done correctly one can obtain a speed boost.[CR]The game is separated into four play types, Grand Prix, Versus, Battle, and Time Trial. In each of these modes the player chooses from 16 race tracks and 8 playable racers, each of which have different attributes such as speed, acceleration, and weight. These attributes affect how each character handles. The Grand Prix mode has four difficulties, 50cc, 100cc, 150cc, and Extra, each progressively faster with more difficult opponents, or in the case of Extra, mirrored versions of all of the tracks. The 16 tracks are divided into 4 cups, and the player is tasked with racing these cups to win trophies. If they achieve all gold trophies in all the cups in each difficulty, they are rewarded with a new title screen. Versus and Battle mode allow players to compete with up to four of their friends via split screen. Versus allows friends to race together on any of the single player tracks, and battle allow players to fight in large arenas using items. Time Trial has a player racing against the clock. This mode will display a " ghost" of the best time, which is a translucent recording of the previous best lap.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The playable characters are:LightweightPlayer select screenToadPrincess PeachYoshiMiddleweightMarioLuigiHeavyweightDonkey KongWarioBowser[CR]Lightweight racers have quick acceleration and excellent handling, but have slow top speeds and are easily knocked around. Middleweight racers are good all around racers with middle of the road attributes. Heavyweight racers have high top speeds and are very difficult to bully, but have slow acceleration and can be difficult to handle.[CR]An early version of the game featured the character Magikoopa instead of Donkey Kong.[CR]Tracks[CR]The 16 tracks in Mario Kart 64 are:Mushroom CupSherbet LandLuigi Raceway - A simple course that slightly resembles a Nascar track.Moo Moo Farm - A bumpy dirt course that circles a farm pasture. Watch out for jumping Monty Moles.Koopa Troopa Beach - A sandy beach island course. A rocky interior is to one side and the ocean to the other.Kalimari Desert - This course is a desert course that weaves across train tracks. Make sure to stop for trains.Flower CupToad's Turnpike - A simple freeway made difficult by oncoming traffic. Avoid getting hit at all cost.Frappe Snowland - A snowscape littered with explosive snowmen and thick snow dunes.Choco Mountain - Race along chocolate cliff overhangs and dodge falling boulders.Mario Raceway - A twisty thin track with piranha plants and a huge green pipe tunnel.Star CupWario Stadium - Resembles a dirt bike race course. Many great jumps and full of shortcuts.Sherbet Land - An ice course around a freezing lake. Avoid the sledding penguins big and small.Royal Raceway - Windy and thin asphalt course. Watch for the hidden Mario 64 castle.Bowsers Castle - Filled with menacing traps and hazards.Special CupDK's Jungle Parkway - A Jungle course with a large jump across a river. Watch out for the ferry.Yoshi Valley - A thin twisting multi-path course. It has many bottomless pits.Banshee Boardwalk - A rickety wooden course with ghosts and a haunted house full of bats.Rainbow Road - A long course in space made of rainbows.[CR]Soundtracks[CR]Mario Kart 64 Race Tracks[CR]The soundtracks to Mario Kart 64 were composed by Kenta Nagata.Mario Kart 64 Greatest Hits Soundtrack[CR]Released: March 1st, 1997[CR]Total length: 31:44Mario Kart 64 ThemeCircuit SelectMoo Moo FarmKoopa Troopa BeachFrappe SnowlandKoopa CastleKalimari DesertRainbow RoadDK's Jungle ParkwayToad's TurnpikeBattle 1Results ThemeTrophy PresentationVictory Lap[CR]Mario Kart 64 Tracks[CR]Mario Kart 64 Theme3 Raceways/Wario StadiumMoo Moo Farm/Yoshi ValleyKoopa Troopa BeachKalimari DesertToad's TurnpikeFrappe Snowland/Sherbet LandChoco Mountain/Battle ArenasKoopa CastleDK's Jungle ParkBanshee BoardwalkRainbow RoadStar PowerSetup and Kart SelectBattle ArenasWinning ResultsLosing ResultsTime Trial ResultsTrophy PresentationsNo Trophy for You!Victory LapBonus TracksStart Your EnginesFinish TrialFinal LapFinish FirstFinish OKFinish OutFinish LastVoice Collection[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Mario Kart 64 initially received relatively positive reviews.

<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mario Party is the first game in Nintendo's popular Mario Party franchise. Mario Party was released on February 8, 1999 in North America, December 14, 1998 in Japan, and March 9, 1999 in Europe and Australia. Mario Party was developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo. The release of Mario Party for the Nintendo 64 marked the beginning of Nintendo's long-running Mario Party franchise (which now contains eleven games total). Mario Party received generally positive reviews, currently holding a 77% average rating on Game Rankings and a 79% average rating on Metacritic. The game was criticized for not having an entertaining single-player, but was praised for its strong multiplayer elements.[CR]The game's story involves a group of Nintendo characters ( Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Wario, and Donkey Kong) arguing over who is the best. Each character brings up their strong aspect, saying that the one who is the best should have that aspect. Toad then suggests that they all take a journey to Mushroom Village, and during their adventures discover who is the best. The group then departs for Mushroom Village, to see who is the best of them all.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mushroom Village, the "menu screen" of the game.[CR]Mario Party establishes many of the gameplay aspects that have become standard in the Mario Party franchise. The player (or players in multiplayer) are placed on one of many "boards" (essentially stages or levels). These boards are separated by spaces (like a regular game board). The goal of the game is to collect the most stars. Only one star is on the board at one time, and it can be purchased for the price of 20 coins. The one other way to get stars is to steal them by using a Boo, who will steal another player's star for the price of 50 coins.[CR]Coins can be collected by landing on blue spaces on the game board or by winning minigames. Coins can then be used to purchase items and stars. In addition, if the game is a tie, then the player with the most coins will win. Coins can be lost as well; if the player lands on a red space, a Bowser space, or loses a certain minigame (not all minigames cause the loser to lose coins).[CR]At the end of a game, three bonus stars are granted to the players. One star goes to the person who had the most coins during the game (not total, at one point), one goes to the person who got the most coins during minigames, and one star goes to the person who landed on the most question mark spaces. If there is a tie for these awards, then the player who has the most coins will be awarded the star.[CR]Minigames are what Mario Party was most praised for. Mario Party has 56 minigames in all of four different types. These types are four player minigames (a free-for-all minigame), two versus two (where two players are on a team versus another team), one versus three (where one player with a large advantage competes against the other three), or one player minigames (they only occur when the player lands on a one-player minigame space, and give the player the opportunity to either gain or lose coins.[CR]A couple of the games minigames involve turning the analong stick in a circular motion as fast as possible. Players quickly relaized that the best strategy to winning was to place their palm flat on the analog stick and spin. This had an unfortunate side effect of the analog sick cutting into the players skin causing noticeable blisters. Nintendo, fearing a lawsuit, eventually offered free latex gloves to anyone who was hurt in this way. Subsequently, follow up games in the series replace this action with alternating between two face buttons rapidly.Boards (Stages)[CR]Artwork of Mario's Rainbow Castle.Mario's Rainbow Castle: A linear board where the path ends at the main tower, there the player will meet either Toad or Bowser. They switch places everytime someone meets them or land on a "?"-space.Luigi's Engine Room: Walk around a giant engine room, paths are limited by blue and red doors that close/opens each turn or by landing on a "?"-space. You can also pay a robot to change them.Eternal Star: The final board that the player need to collect 100 stars in total to enter. You need to buy the stars from Baby Bowser instead of Toad on this board, but only if you roll a bigger dice than him.DK's Jungle Adventure: A jungle board that features path blocking Whomps, Indiana Jones boulder and the only board with two Boos to visit. "?"-space will trigger the boulder and chase all players in it's path.Yoshi's Tropical Island: Two tropical islands connected by bridges, Toad is on the right island, Bowser on the left. However these two swap places every time a "?"-space is landed on.Wario's Battle Island: On this board player will meet Bom-ombs that force them into a cannon and blast them to the next section of the board. Cannons directions is reversed if a "?"-space is landed on.Peach's Birthday Cake: This board have most "?"-spaces in the game. If player lands on one, they can pay 30 coins for a star stealing Pirhana plant, then if a opponent land on that space his/her star is stolen and given to you, then the plant disappear. In addtion to that: The player must "lose" a lottery in order to see Toad, while the "winner" will meet Bowser.Bowser's Magma Mountain: Bowser's board, players should avoid Bowser at all cost on this board as he might steal a star from you. "?"-space will make all blue spaces red for the next 3 turns. This board can bepurchased in the shop when the other boards have been played.SPACESBLUE SPACE: Player gets 3 coins.

If the player lands on this space with 0 coins however, Bowser will actually give you coins, leaving a confused player character. The player panel will become red.STAR-SPACE: This will let the player play "1-player mini-game" to earn some extra coins, losing it however will result in losing 5 coins instead. The player panel will become blue.MUSHROOM-SPACE: Will make the player hit a special dice with two outcomes, either you roll a extra dice the current turn or you have to skip your next one. The player panel will become blue.[CR]Mini-Game Island[CR]From Mushroom village it is possible to go to the Mini-game island. At the beginning you choose a your character and ally character. (For 2 vs 2 games, you'll never face this character as a opponent) You're then presented with a map screen (Mario World style) and it's your objective to make it from the start to the goal and recieve a secret price. The stages is actually the mini-games from the game and you need to win them or beat their condition to pass them and be allowed to move on. The coins you earn from mini-games goes into a total and earn you a extra life each time it passes 100. Fail the mini-game and you lose a life, lose all of them and you start from where you last saved. On the map there is also some Koopa Troopa spaces where you can save and return to the village. The map path is linar but does a split and reconnects later at some point, allowing the player to chose what mini-games he wants to challenge.[CR]Mini Games[CR]4-Player Mini GamesBalloon Burst: Hit A and B (or A and Z) back and forth repeatedly in order to make a Bowser balloon inflate and, eventually, explode.

<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mario Party 2 is the second game in the Mario Party franchise. Mario Party 2 was released on January 24, 2000 in North America, December 17, 1999 in Japan, October 12, 2000 in Europe, and November 6, 2000 in Australia. The game was developed by Hudson Soft and published by Nintendo (as with every other game in the franchise besides Mario Party-e). Mario Party 2 was generally well-received from critics, garnering an average review score of 76% from Game Rankings. The game was criticized for not differing much from its predecessor, however.[CR]The plot of the game involves Mario and his friends creating a world called "Mario Land," but then Wario wants to call the world "Wario Land." They begin arguing over the name, with other characters introducing their own names. As this is happening, Bowser decides to try and invade the world. Whoever can defeat Bowser will get the world named after them.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]One of the game's many four player minigames.[CR]The goal of Mario Party 2 is to gather the most stars before the end of the game. To do this, players are placed on a game board (similar to that of a real life board game) in which they travel spaces each turn, gathering coins and items to the ultimate goal of a star. Coins can also be gathered by participating in minigames. The winner is presented with a set amount of coins, while the losers are rewarded with nothing.[CR]Mario Party 2 has several new features. Each character (Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Wario, and Donkey Kong) has a costume unique to each game board. So, depending on which board the game is on, the costume for the character changes to that certain theme. For example, if the players are in Space Land, then the characters will be dressed in space-related attire.[CR]The game also adds new spaces to the game board. In addition to adding buildings (which have their own spaces on the game board), Mario Party 2 adds a Battle Space, Item Space, and Bank Space. The battle space will trigger a battle minigame, which are introduced in this game. The item space begins a minigame that allows the player to win an item. The bank space opens up the Koopa Bank, giving whoever stepped on the bank space all coins currently in the bank.[CR]The minigames are what the Mario Party franchise is most known for. In addition to introducing the battle minigames, Mario Party 2 contains four player minigames, two versus two minigames, one versus three minigames, item minigames (triggered by the item space), and duel minigames. Four player minigames pit all four players into a free-for-all, two versus two is a team game with randomly selected teams, one versus three pits one player with an advantage versus the other three, and duel minigames are minigames between two players.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]"Even when you win, you lose, Mario Party..."Jeff Gerstmann, (Mario Party Party 2)[CR]</plot>

<rom name="plugin://plugin.program.iarl/Emulator/N64_ZachMorris/Game/Mario+Party+3+%28USA%29" size="25885408"/>
<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The game's title screen with the Mario Party crew.[CR]Mario Party 3 was the final game in the popular series to be released on the Nintendo 64.It was the first in the series to feature duel maps, multiple save slots, and allowing characters to carry three items instead of one. Copies of the game have become very rare in Europe and are now sold online for very high prices. Mario Party 3 probably made the biggest additions and changes in the history of the series and because of this, hard core fans of the series are divided between those who love it dearly and those who desperately hate it. Many of the new additions made in this game did not make a return when the series shifted over to the GameCube with Mario Party 4.[CR]Battle Royal[CR][B]Description:[/B][CR]Battle Royal is the same mode that was used in previous Mario Party games. The objective is to move around the game board and collect as many stars as possible. The person who has the most stars by the end of the predetermined amount of turns wins. Players obtain stars at the Star Space for 20 coins. The Star Space is randomly determined and each time somebody gets a star, the Star Space moves to another location on the board. At the end of each turn, the 4 characters compete in a mini-game. The winner(s) of the mini-game receives 10 coins. To move around the board, players hit a 10-sided dice block, and the number they get determines how far they move.Spaces[CR]There are a total of 8 different spaces players can land on each board:Blue Space: The most frequent space on all of the boards. If you land on this, you will get 3 coins (6 in the last 5 turns) and a blue status for that turn.Red Space: Landing on this will make you lose 3 coins (6 in the last 5 turns) and give you a red status for that turn.Happening Space: A green space with a question mark on top. Landing on one has a variety of actions, depending on the board and the location. It will give you a green status for that turnBowser Space: The worse space to possibly land on. Bowser will bring up a roulette, each option with a horrible consequence, which includes losing stars and coins. This also gives a red status.Chance Time Space: A green space with an exclamation mark on top. This brings up a slot machine with 3 panels. The left and right panel are the playing characters while the middle one is the yield. Players can give a certain amount of coins or stars to the other player, or they could both swap coins or stars. This also gives a green status.Battle Space: All players must give up a certain amount of coins to the pot and play a mini-game. 1st place gets 70% and second place gets 30%.Item Space: One of the best spaces because there is a high reward and no risk. You either play an item mini-game to earn items or you get asked a question by Toad or Baby Bowser and they give you an item if you picked the right answer. This space gives a green status.Koopa Bank Space: Passing by this space will force you to give up 5 coins to the Koopa Bank. Landing on this space will give you all of the coins the Koopa Bank has collected. Landing here gives a green status.Game Guy Space: Landing on this space will force you to surrender all of your coins, and play a Game Guy mini-game. Winning will double your coin total, but if you lose, all your coins will be lost.[CR]Duel Mode[CR][B]Description:[/B][CR]Duel mode was a completely new addition to the Mario Party series. In duel mode there are only two combatants instead of the usual 4. The objective here is different than Battle Royal; instead of collecting stars, the mission is to remove the enemy's 5 heart pieces. To do this, you can use a partner that you pay 10 coins for, and they will move in front of you. If you walk into the enemy, they will attack him or her which will result in lost heart pieces, depending on how strong the partner is. You can also have a partner be put behind you so you can use some defense. The partner you get is determined by a roulette. Partners also have a salary that you have to pay on a turn-basis. They will disappear if you cannot pay for their services. If both combatants are still alive by the end of the predetermined amount of turns, then the character with the most heart pieces wins. If they have the same amount of heart pieces, then the character with the most coins wins. If they still somehow have the same amount of heart pieces and coins, then the winner will be determined by who rolls a higher number on 10-sided dice block.Spaces[CR]There are some new spaces exclusively for the Duel Mode and some from Battle Royal. There are also others from Battle Royal that are not present in Duel Mode. The following are the spaces in Duel Mode:Normal Space: A normal, blank space. When you land on one, your characters face will mark it. If you land on the same space again, you will earn 5 coins. If enemy lands on it, you will receive 5 coins from them. You can also land it your enemy's space(s).Mini-Game Space: When this space is landed on, a mini-game begins and the winner receives 5 coins.Power-Up Space: When somebody lands on a Power-Up Space, his or her characters' stats will go up, however, so will their salary.Reverse Space: If landed on, you are forced to roll again and move in the opposite direction.Happening Space: A green space with a question mark on top. Landing on one has a variety of actions, depending on the board and the location.Game Guy Space: Landing on this space will force you to surrender all of your coins, and play a Game Guy mini-game.

DescriptionLocationKoopa Bros. Fortress Acting as the game’s initial dungeon, the Koopa Bros. Fortress is, fittingly enough, the domain of the four Koopa Brothers. The building was previously occupied by several friendly Bob-ombs, but they were imprisoned in the fortress’s basement when the Koopa Bros. took over. The first Star Spirit, Eldstar, is held captive in the fortress by the Koopa Bros.Mario and Kooper in the basement of the Koopa Brothers' Fortress.Dry Dry Ruins An enormous temple that was buried for many years under the sands of Dry Dry Desert, Dry Dry Ruins is the location of the second Star Spirit, Mamar. The temple emerges from beneath the sand after Mario pinpoints its hidden location by using the tracking abilities of the “Pulse Stone.” Home to a multitude of Chain Chomps, and their master, Tutankoopa, the Dry Dry Ruins is filled with many assorted enemies, including Pokeys. It is in the Dry Dry Ruins that Mario finds the powerful upgrade to his original hammer, the Super Hammer.Mario and Parakarry navigating the Dry Dry Ruins.Gusty Gulch Located just beyond the Forever Forest and Boo Mansion, Gusty Gulch is a small, dilapidated, village that is home to several Boos, as well as a fearsome boss – the “invincible” Tubba Blubba. The Boo inhabitants of the village are being terrorized by Tubba Blubba, who has taken to eating any Boo that he crosses paths with as a means of revenge for the harassment he endured from the Boos in the past. Once Mario discovers the weakness of Tubba Blubba, and defeats him in the Windy Mill at the base of Gusty Gulch, the Star Spirit Skolar is freed from his imprisonment by the Boos.Mario and Goombario talking to a resident Boo in Gusty Gulch.Shy Guy's Toy Box A toy box that is located inside of an abandoned house in Southern Toad Town, Shy Guy’s Toy Box is home to many Shy Guys, as well as the game’s sixth party member, Watt. The Toy Box shrinks anyone who enters it, so although the box is small in a literal sense, when Mario and friends are inside the Toy Box the size of the surrounding area appears to be much larger in scale. Inside of the Toy Box is a large set of railroad tracks and a train, along with several color-coded stations placed at various locations throughout the box. Mario travels to each of these stations to complete a specific task or recover a specific item, before moving on to the next station in the line. Upon defeating the area’s boss, General Guy, the fourth Star Spirit, Muskular, will be freed from his captivity and will return to Star Haven.Mario and Watt finding their way through the Shy Guy's Toy Box.Lavalava Island Lavalava Island is an island located to the south-west of Toad Town, and is home to a large population of Yoshis, as well as a sizable volcano named Mt. Lavalava. When Mario initially reaches the island he must help some Yoshis in Yoshi Village find their missing children, who are lost somewhere in the Jade Jungle. Once the children are all found, Mario gains the support of his sixth party member, Sushie. After navigating through the Jade Jungle, Mario reaches the Mt. Lavalava volcano. With the “help” of Professor Kolorado, Mario is able to successfully find his way through the volcano and defeat the area’s boss, the Lava Piranha – a giant Piranha Plant that dwells inside the molten magma of the volcano and makes use of several fire-based attacks. Once the Lava Piranha is defeated, the fifth Star Spirit, Misstar, is freed.Mario and Goombario in the middle of Yoshi Village on Lavalava Island.Flower Fields Flower Fields is an isolated and secluded sanctuary of nature located in the northwestern corner of The Mushroom Kingdom. The area’s condition of endless sunshine is being endangered by the wicked, cloud-shaped menace Huff N. Puff (as well as his many underlings) who has been implementing a nefarious contraption known as the “Puff-Puff Machine” to create artificial cloud cover and block-out the sun. These actions are a direct threat to many of the residents of Flower Fields, including the plant-like “Bub-ulbs” and the Wise Wisterwood tree. Mario encounters his seventh party member, Lakilester, in Flower Fields. Lakilester is a Lakitu that was previously working for Huff N. Puff and who fought against Mario, but after being defeated by Mario, he elects to join forces with him. After Mario succeeds in toppling Huff N. Puff and clearing the air over Flower Fields, the sixth Star Spirit, Klevar, is rescued, and returns to join the other Star Spirits in Star Haven.Mario and Lakilester in front of the Wise Wisterwood tree in Flower Fields.Crystal PalaceCrystal Palace is located in the northeast mountains of the Mushroom Kingdom. In order to reach the Palace and free the final Star Spirit, Mario must travel through Shiver City at the base of the mountain, and then climb to the top of the mountain. After Mario defeats the boss, the Crystal King, the final Star Spirit, Kalmar, is released and joins the others in Star Haven to complete the reunion. With all seven Star Spirits restored to their full power, Mario prepares to challenge Bowser in a final showdown.Mario and Bow in Shiver City.[CR]Star Spirits[CR]DescriptionAppearanceEldstar He is the elder of the star spirits, and is the first to be rescued by Mario.

He'll never come back, so you'll lose any XP you would have normally gained by fighting him.A Lemon Candy can be made with a Lemon and Cake Mix. The Lemon can be found in the Dry Dry Desert level. Bring them to Tayce T in the main town and she'll make one for you.</plot>

<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Mario 64 was the original launch and pack-in title for the Nintendo 64. Developed by Shigeru Miyamoto's team at Nintendo EAD, it was released alongside the console on September 29th, 1996 in North America. The game pioneered many elements of the 3D subgenre of platformer. The game sold over 11.8 million copies worldwide and was also one of the first N64 games available for the Wii's Virtual Console collection of retro releases.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Princess Peach's invitation to Mario.[CR]The plot of Super Mario 64 starts off with Mario arriving at Princess Peach's castle at her invitation and promise of cake. However, upon arriving, he finds the castle nearly deserted and learns that the evil Bowser has once again abducted her. In order to stop Bowser and rescue the princess, Mario must explore the worlds within a series of paintings hanging in various rooms throughout the castle and collect the power stars hidden in each. Only once he has the necessary stars will he be able to face off against Bowser and save Peach.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]BasicsMario is introduced to the third dimension in Super Mario 64.[CR]Super Mario 64 takes the core concepts of the 2D Super Mario titles and applies them to a 3D space. The player takes control of Mario and runs, jumps, swims, and flies through the games various stages in order to complete challenges and collect power stars. The game uses Peach's castle as a hub world; within the castle, there are paintings that transport Mario to various worlds that contain power stars. As the player collects more power stars, more regions of the castle become available with new paintings to explore. By ultimately collecting enough stars, the player is able to access the final level in which Bowser resides for the final showdown.Controls[CR]Mario's movements are controlled using the controller's analog stick. Gentle tilts of the stick cause Mario to move at a walking pace, while tilting further causes him to break into a run. Pressing the A Button allows Mario to jump, and for the first time in the Super Mario series, he can perform actions such as a wall jump, a jumping backflip, and a running triple jump.Mario performing a backflip.Mario going for a swim.Walking - Press the analog stick gently in the desired direction.Running - Press the analog stick all the way in the desired direction.Wall Hug - Hold the analog stick at the same angle as the wall to slide along it.Jump - Press A to jump.Double Jump - Press A to jump and then again after returning to the ground to jump higher than the first jump.Triple Jump - Same as double jump but with a third jump added after returning to the ground. This last jump is the highest and Mario will do a flip at the apex.Wall Jump - Jump toward a wall and then jump again to leap off the wall.Reverse Back Flip - Press the analog stick in one direction and then in the opposite direction while pressing A.Crouch - Press Z and Mario will duckCrouching Slide - Run with the analog stick and then press Z.Crawl - Press Z and press the analog stick in a direction to crawl.Back Flip - Hold Z and press A.Butt Stomp - Jump with A and then press Z for Mario to slam the ground with his bottom.Long Jump - While Running press Z and then A to do a flying leap.Punch - Press B.Combo Punch - Tap B three times in a row to throw two punches and a kick.Jump Kick - Press A to jump and then B to kick.Dive Attack - While running press B to dive at enemies.Jump Dive Attack - While running press A to jump and then B to Dive through the air.Leg Sweep - Hold Z and then press B to do a leg sweep.Sliding Kick - While Running press Z and then B to do a sliding kick.Grab - Press B next to an object.Throw - While holding something press B to throw it.Spin - Mario can spin Bowser by his tail and throw him. The Player can  grab his tail with B, rotate the control stick to spin him, and then press B again to release him.Grapple - Jump and hold A while beneath any grating or mesh to grab it. Move the analog stick to swing an any direction.Swim - While in water tap A to swim and use the analog stick to choose direction.Kick Swim - While in the water hold A to kick swim and use the analog to choose direction.Climb Up - While hanging from a ledge press A to climb up.Drop Down - While hanging from a ledge press down on the analog stick.Climb Poles - Press A to jump at a pole and grab it automatically. Then press up or down to ascend or descend the pole and left or right to circle the pole.Hand Stand - While on a pole press up until reaching the top. At the top press up to do a hand stand on the pole and then A to jump off it.Flying - While wearing the Winged Cap triple jump or launch out of a cannon to start flying and use the control stick to steer. Z will cause Mario to butt stomp out of flying.Camera ControlsLakitu, traditionally an enemy of Mario, serves as the game's camera operator.[CR]Super Mario 64 was an early example of a game that offered the player manual control over the camera. The C Buttons on the N64 controller could nudge the camera to provide a better view of the action, while the C Up button zoomed the camera in to view the world from Mario's eyes.[CR]Lakitu, a character commonly seen in the Super Mario series as one of Mario's enemies, has a new role in Super Mario 64 as the game's cameraman. At times when the player is viewing Mario's reflection in a mirrored surface, Lakitu can also be seen behind him, holding the camera if the viewing angle is right.[CR]Presentation[CR]As the first polygonal Super Mario title, Super Mario 64's graphics were a significant change from the sprite art of Super Mario World. Super Mario 64 is also the first Mario title to feature voice acting. Mario's voice in the game is provided by Charles Martinet, who to date has provided the character's voice in every Mario title with vocals.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]LevelDescriptionBob-omb's BattlefieldBob-omb's Battlefield is comprised of green grassy fields, deep ravines, a high spiraling mountain plateau, and a floating island in the sky. It is ruled by the King Bob-omb, found atop the mountain, and his army of bob-ombs. Five cannons littered across the level make for easy traveling, but beware Wan Wan, a giant Chain-Chomp chained to a pole in the center.Whomp's FortressWhomp's Fortress is a huge floating island with a tower in the center and many smaller floating islands all around. This level is easy to fall from, and can be difficult to navigate for beginners. A tower appears after Mario defeats the evil Button King, a giant wall that tries to crush its opponents. Some enemies to watch out for are the sleeping piranha plants and mini button minions. There is also a friendly owl that will take Mario for a ride if found. This level was remade and appears again in Super Mario Galaxy 2 as part of the Throwback Galaxy.Jolly Roger BayJolly Roger Bay is an aquatic level with a deep underwater cave hiding buried treasure, sunken ships, and giant electric eels. Clams hide coins which help replenish Mario's health and prevent him from drowning. Use the metal cap to walk along the bottom of the ocean and find the turtle shell to rocket through the water.Cool, Cool MountainCool, Cool Mountain is a giant spiraling ice mountain. Mario can slide down the mountain side or go in the ski lodge chimney and race a giant penguin. Watch out for the baby penguin. Mario will want to help it back to its mother andwhile he's at it find the snowman head a new body.Bowser In The Dark WorldBowser In The Dark World is the first of three Bowser levels. This level is linear and has only one path to Bowser's lair. Only one star is obtainable in this level: a reward for collecting 8 red coins. At the top, the player must enter the green pipe and fight Bowser for the Key to the Basement. To defeat Bowser, the player must grab him by the tail and throw him into one of the bombs surrounding the arena.Big Boo's HauntBig Boo's Haunt is a level hidden inside a boo in the castle courtyard. It is a giant haunted house with many ghosts and secret rooms. Mario will have to fight Big Boos for their stars throughout the mansion, such as on a giant merry go round in the basement. Go around the back of the mansion for a secret door. Large eyeball enemies that appear in this world can be defeated if if Mario run circles around them to make them dizzy.Hazy Maze CaveHazy Maze Cave is a set of underground caverns. There are rolling boulders to dodge, fiery pits to jump, and tunnels filled with poison. Deep within this complex is a tranquil lake with a friendly dinosaur creature called Nessie who will help Mario navigate to a star, as well as the secret green P switch that unlocks green boxes. After obtaining it Mario will be able to use the metal cap to turn into Metal Mario.Lethal Lava LandLethal Lava Land is an ocean of lava with platforms and set pieces jutting up out of it. Mario must leap from platform to platform and avoid falling in the lava. This can be difficult, as many of the enemies try to bump Mario off, and some of the platforms move. In the center is a volcano that conceals a giant inner chamber.Shifting Sand LandShifting Sand Land is a giant desert with a huge pyramid in the center. It has many deadly sand traps and powerful sand whirlwinds which will throw Mario through the air. The pyramid is filled with obstacles, and two giant stone hands with eyes wait in the dark to crush Mario. There is also a giant vulture flying through the sky who is holding onto a star and can steal Mario's hat. When hatless, Mario's defense is reduced and he takes more damage.Dire Dire DocksDire Dire Docks is a water level with a huge whirlpool and a docked submarine. There is also a giant shark that Mario should avoid. Once the second Bowser stage has been completed, the submarine will mysteriously disappear.Bowser In The Fire SeaBowser In The Fire Sea is much like Lethal Lava Lands in that it is a giant lava ocean. The level extends vertically up out of the lava so that a misstep will send Mario falling into a fiery pit. Like the first Bowser level, Bowser In The Fire Sea is linear and it too has a red coins star. At the top is spirally portal that will lead to Mario's second encounter with Bowser, who holds the key for the upstairs. This battle sees Bowser with a few new tricks, but he can be defeated once again by throwing him into the bombs lining the battlefield.Snowman's LandSnowman's Land is a snow level with a huge snowman in the center. Mario can scale the snowman but should watch that he isn't blown off by the snowman's powerful breath. Mario will lose his hat if he is. The lake is frigid and will slowly damage Mario, but a skilled player can jump on the flower hatted snowmen to fly over it.Wet-Dry WorldWet-Dry world is a very vertical level. Mario can scale the cliffs and floating platforms to adjust the water level using switches. The water level present at the stage's start is dependent on whether Mario makes a high or low jump through the painting to enter the stage. There is a hidden town with a bell tower though an underwater tunnel.Tall, Tall MountainTall, Tall Mountain is all about scaling a large mountain surrounded by an abyss. There are many places where if Mario falls he will be taken back to the bottom or lose a life. There is a mischievous monkey that can steal Mario's hat and a sliding challenge much like the earlier snow lodge sledding course. Some of the most difficult tasks have Mario jumping across huge toadstools growing from the abyss around the mountain.Tiny-Huge IslandThis appropriately named level has features that allow Mario to transition between tiny and huge sizes. Depending on Mario's size, the player can affect the environment in different ways. The level has a grassy mountain in the center which can be difficult to scale. The wind is dangerous in this level and can cause Mario to fall to his doom. A giant Wiggler, an easy-to-anger centipede-like creature with boots, lives at the top of the mountain.Tick Tock ClockTick Tock Clock is a level consisting of the inside of a clock. The level requires Mario to ascend a hexagonal structure dodging swinging pendulums and riding conveyor belts and clock hands. Depending on what time it is on the clock when Mario enters the level, the level's obstacles change speed. Certain speeds will make certain stars easier to obtain.Rainbow RideRainbow Ride takes place high up in the sky and has Mario flying on magic carpets and swaying air ships. There is a giant mansion in the sky complete with a fire place and table. This course is very difficult as a single misstep will send Mario to his death.Bowser In The SkyBowser In The Sky is linear like its predecessors and also has a red coins star. It is the longest and arguably hardest of the Bowser levels and at the top is a pipe that leads Mario to his final confrontation with the Koopa King. To defeat Bowser this time Mario must launch him into three bombs instead of just one. After Bowser is hit two times the land next to the bombs falls away leaving the arena in the shape of a star. This makes the last throw to kill Bowser more difficult as it must be done from farther away. When Bowser is destroyed, Mario is awarded with a giant star and Princess Peach is rescued.[CR]Items[CR]Super Mario 64 excludes many of the franchise's classic items, such as the super mushroom and fire flower, in favor of special hats that give Mario unique abilities for a limited time. These caps include the metal cap that make him invulnerable and able to walk on the ocean floor, the vanish cap that allows him to pass through certain barriers, and the wing cap that lets him fly.[CR]However, some classic Mario items do make a return. These include the 1-up mushroom, Koopa shell, and collectible coins, though the functions of coins and shells are different compared to previous Super Mario games. In Super Mario 64, Koopa shells are rare and can be used to surf across the ground and destroy enemies, while collecting coins can restore Mario's health gauge. There are also three types of coins, yellow, blue, and red, worth one, two, and five health points respectively. Additionally, each world contains eight red coins, and collecting all eight during one visit earns Mario a power star.[CR]Development[CR]Super Mario 64 CG artwork[CR]Shigeru Miyamoto began work on a 3D iteration of the Mario franchise after working on Star Fox for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. For a time he considered developing it for the Super Nintendo, but later decided to develop it for the Nintendo 64 due to the limitations of the SNES's hardware. The team spent many of the first months developing the camera and how the gameplay would work.[CR]Originally the game levels were to be linear, but it was later decided that they should be open, free-roaming environments. However, the concept of linear levels can still be seen in final game in the Bowser levels, which require Mario to traverse a set path of obstacles to reach Bowser's lair. The development team prioritized making Mario's movements feel fluid and natural.[CR]Before any levels were created, they tested his movements in a simple grid level which featured a golden bunny named "MIPS". This character later made an appearance in the final game. When the levels were finally designed, they incorporated more puzzles than was typically associated with Mario games. This is probably because The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was in development at the same time but was not released until years later. Some of its puzzle ideas were likely incorporated into Mario 64.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack to Super Mario 64 was composed by renowned Nintendo composer Koji Kondo. It was first published by Pony Canyon in Japan on July 19, 1996. It was later published in North America by Nintendo on November 1st, 1996.Super Mario 64 Original SoundtrackIt's a me, Mario!Title ThemePeach's MessageOpeningSuper Mario 64 Main ThemeSliderInside the Castle WallsLooping StepsDire, Dire DocksLethal Lava LandSnow MountainHaunted HouseMerry-Go-RoundCave DungeonPirahna Plant's LullabyPowerful MarioMetallic MarioFile SelectCorrect SolutionToad's MessagePower StarRace FanfareStar Catch FanfareGame StartCourse ClearGame OverStage BossKoopa's MessageKoopa's RoadKoopa's ThemeKoopa ClearUltimate KoopaUltimate Koopa ClearEnding DemoStaff RollPirahna Plant's Lullaby-Piano[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Super Mario 64 is one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful video games of all time. It was the top selling Nintendo 64 game and is the second highest selling Wii Virtual Console game. As of the end of 2007, it has sold 11.8 million copies world wide. The game is often praised as having revolutionized the 3D platformer and for pioneering many of the key gameplay concepts used in modern platforming games.[CR]DS Remake[CR]A remake of Super Mario 64 entitled Super Mario 64 DS was released for the original DS handheld on November 20, 2004. The game is faithful to the original version and contains all of the original levels. Additions made to the game include a variety of new minigames, as well as the ability to play the game as Luigi, Yoshi, or Wario.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Yoshi on the Castle roof topThe fastest recorded completion time for Super Mario 64 is 6 minutes and 41 seconds. This run makes use of various glitches in the game that make the game beatable with zero stars.Collecting all 120 stars in the game grants access to the castle roof, where players can meet Yoshi, who gives Mario 99 lives and a flashy new triple jump, along with a friendly message. Bowser's final message to Mario upon his defeat also changes if Mario has collected all 120 stars.Super Mario 64 marks the first time that Peach is referred to by her original Japanese name in the Super Mario series and the last in which she is referred to by her original western localized name, Princess Toadstool. The very first game to see a western release using Peach's original name was the Super NES game Yoshi's Safari.Not counting Yoshi's Island, this is one of the few times that Shy Guy enemies appear in a mainline Mario game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] A Bob-omb Magic Trick[CR]Go to Shifting Land Land and do the "Another place for a second hat" trick. Now go back to the start and pick up a Bob-omb. He'll magically disappear, and you are holding your hat! The smoke sounds wil still be there, but Mario will be holding his red cap like a Bob-omb. Don't press B and wait. Woah! The ticking sound stopped, and no explosion happened. Where did the bomb go? Now, go to one of those tornados in the quick sand and keep on going into it until---the Bob-omb comes out of you and explodes! Cogratulations! Mario has done his first magic trick!  [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Bob-omb Battlefield Warp 1[CR]There is a warp in Bob-omb Battlefield that lets you get from one side of the level to another quickly. After going up the first slanted bridge, go right and stand in the flower bed. The game will warp you to another flower bed, near the mountain. You can also warp from the flower bed next to the mountain to the flower bed next to the slanted bridge.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Ice Slide in Cool, Cool Mountain[CR]When doing the ice slide if you stay on the slide and follow the coins (a certain patch of coins won't follow the slide and will instead point to a wall) you will go into a secret tunnel hidden in the wall where you can get 2 one-up mushrooms and get to the finish line quicker.</plot>

<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dr. Mario is a puzzle game developed by Nintendo R&amp;D1 and published by Nintendo. The game was originally released on the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy in 1990. It has since seen many sequels and remakes, such as Dr. Mario &amp; Puzzle League on the Game Boy Advance and Dr. Mario Online RX on WiiWare. The soundtrack was composed by Hirokazu "Hip" Tanaka.[CR]According to the instruction booklet, Mario is now working as a doctor in the virus research lab at the Mushroom Kingdom Hospital. As usual, Dr. Mario is about to begin his research when Nurse Toadstool informs him that several viruses are out of control and spreading quickly. Mario exclaims "Oh No! We've got to do something! I have just developed a new vitamin that should be able to take care of it. I sure hope this stuff works!"[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in Dr. Mario[CR]Dr. Mario is a puzzle game that uses much the same falling block mechanic made ubiquitous by Tetris. Vitamin capsules are dropped into the play field and must be rotated to remove viruses hovering at fixed spots (each half the size of a vitamin.) The vitamins are colored one of three colors on each side (red, yellow, or blue,) and the colors of the vitamin must be matched with the corresponding viruses of the same colors. After stacking up four of the same color, the virus is eliminated. After destroying all viruses on the playing field, the player progresses to the next level.[CR]The player can select 21 different levels (0 to 20), and players who can clear level 20 can make it all the way to level 24 (clearing 24 just repeats this level continuously). Each level has a different amount of viruses, and in level 20 there are 84. No more than 84 can fit, making each level after 20 have 84 viruses as well. The player can also select the background music, either Fever or Chill. The game speed can also be set to low, medium, or high.  The more time spent clearing a particular level, the faster the game speed will gradually become. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Cutscenes[CR]If you beat levels 5,10,15, or 20 on MEDIUM or HIGH speed, you will get a small cutscene. Also level 20 on LOW speed as well.</plot>

<plot>Yoshi is an action puzzle game starring Mario's dinosaur buddy Yoshi, and other familiar characters like Little Goomba and Blooper. Once again, Mario is going to have to battle away to save Yoshi, who is imprisoned in an egg. Match the eggshells to release Yoshi and score big points! [CR]--From the NES Yoshi instruction manual.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]By controlling Mario at the bottom of the platform, make Mario flip the columns so the falling pieces match 2 enemies of Mario's. The 4 possible enemy matches are some of Mario's most recognizable enemies (Squid, Goomba, Boo, and Piranha). You can also get enemies trapped between 2 halves of the eggshell and the egg will fall and eliminate each one and make a Yoshi baby. In 2 modes, both resembling Tetris, a "free score" mode and an "eliminate all enemies" mode. Go wild on Yoshi's debut game! [CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]A Button Flip Columns[CR]B Button Flip Columns[CR]Start Button Start/Pause[CR]Select Button Select Players[CR][B]Hints:[/B][CR]-Column Switch[CR]Remember you can switch columns even while waiting for things to fall. Watch the top of the screen to see what's next, and try to set up for the next turn before the current objects get all the way down. This can be especially useful if you switch a falling object with a column higher than that object. The object keeps falling at the same rate and gives you some time to plan.

<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mario Bros. is the first in a long line of Mario Bros. titles, although its differences from the later games are significant.[CR]Comparison to other Mario Games[CR]Mario Bros. Firsts[CR]Mario - initially called Jumpman - was introduced in Nintendo's first Donkey Kong video game. There, his only offensive ability was the hammer which, like Pac-Man's power pellets, were limited in number and duration. Here, Mario has an ongoing offensive power, one that he would use throughout the sequels, that of jumping under a thing that is standing on a ledge above. While this is usually an optional attack in the later games, for Mario Bros. it's vital for finishing a given stage. Punching underneath a monster flips it over or changes its color (in lieu of flipping it over). Only when upside down is a monster safe to touch. Should Mario touch a monster, he actually boots it into the water at the bottom of the screen, scoring points and defeating the enemy. Other firsts which would find their way into later Mario Bros. titles:This game was the first appearance of the iconic turtle enemy called the Shell Creeper, later dubbed the Koopa Troopa. Mario could not, however, jump on their backs as he could later, even though the Shell Creepers and Koopa Troopas look nearly identical.Shining sewer pipes, too, made their first appearance. This time they serve as monster dispensers, and reminders that game takes place in a sewer.Many things fall into the sewers, including baby turtles which grow up to be Shell Creepers, but another iconic thing that might get lost in a storm drain is a coin. Thus, coins are brought in as extra scoring items every time an enemy is killed. You pick them up before they reach the bottom of the screen, you get extra points.The POW block, used to flip all the monsters over who are currently standing on a surface, is later employed in other Super Mario games (though its "zapper-like" abilities are changed).Fireballs also make an appearance, looking a bit more like the fireballs Mario and Luigi throw when they've picked up a flower in Super Mario Bros., but fireballs in this game are enemies.And last, but not least, the simultaneous two-player mode introduces Luigi, a swapped-palette Mario.Elements Unique to Mario Bros.[CR]Many elements in Mario Bros. did not get picked up for later installments of the Mario Bros. series. Other enemies, such as the hopping Fighter Flies, ice-patch creating Slipice blobs, and crabby Sidesteppers are seen nowhere else. Neither is the complex punching-under-then-hopping-up-to-kill-the-monster mechanic, although there are certain situations in later games where this is a viable tactic. Touching an enemy when it isn't supine brings instant death, and possibly the most notable difference is that the game is largely defensive. In Donkey Kong before it, and all Super Mario games after, Mario as a player character is largely the mover, moving the game from scene to scene. Here Mario and Luigi defend territory until they win - the scenery eventually changes, but only slightly.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Jump through floors[CR]Jump right under a floor. Right when you're about to hit the bottom of the floor, pause the game by pressing [B]Start[/B]. Then press [B]Start[/B] again to unpause it. If you timed it correctly, you will jump right through the floor and end up on top of it! [CR][B][I]Note[/I][/B]: This glitch requires good timing to pause the game, so this will not always work.</plot>

<rom name="plugin://plugin.program.iarl/Emulator/NES_ZachMorris/Game/Mario+Is+Missing%21+%28USA%29" size="114342"/>
<plot>[CR][B]Summary:[/B][CR]Mario is Missing is one of Nintendo's many entries into the "edutainment" genre, and one of the few Nintendo games to feature the Mario brother Luigi as the main playable character.[CR]Mario is Missing is a unique Mario game in that the action does not occur in the Mushroom Kingdom, but rather on terrestrial Earth, set in a time contemporary to the game's release date. The visual style of the game is borrowed its SNES contemporary Super Mario World, from the title's font to the overworld city maps.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Even the greats have bad days.[CR]Mario sets off towards Bowser's castle to stop Bowser's evil plan of covering the world in water by melting Antarctica. It is later discovered that Bowser plans to melt the continent with a large number of hair dryers, purchased with money gained from stolen valuable artifacts from across the Earth.[CR]While Luigi is hesitant to enter Bowser's castle, Mario makes a bold entrance, only to be captured moments later. Luigi must then enter the castle solo, searching through each of the dungeon's warp doors for Mario, while at the same time recovering all of the stolen artifacts from Bowser's loyal Koopas. Upon returning each stolen artifact, more doors to the castle unlock, allowing Luigi to search more places until he eventually reaches Antarctica to save his brother and stop Bowser from his evil plan.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]From the warp doors in Bowser's castle, players are transported to various cities across the world. Here, by the flyers attached to tourist information booths, Luigi discovers that the Koopas have stolen culturally significant artifacts. Luigi is able to speak to other people populating the town, ranging from a professor, to a schoolboy, to a police woman. The player gathers clues to correctly identify the missing artifacts, such as the Sistine Chapel painting, or the Forbidden City. To gather additional clues, Luigi also has access to a computer and telephone, both from which he can learn about the missing artifacts. Luigi can call general information, and also receives calls from Mario from time to time, giving tips on generic gameplay.Save the world, or keep the flute. Hmm...[CR]Players also have access to an overworld map, showing the street connections, as well as Koopa and warp pipe locations. Being in the real world, Luigi is also able to speed up travel by taking a taxi cab across town, or out to hard to reach places, such as Alcatraz Island.[CR]A map showing the entire world, called the Globulator, allows players to control Yoshi, as he hops from continent to continent. When the player places Yoshi on the correct city of Luigi's location, Yoshi appears on the stage with him, and Luigi is able to ride the dinosaur throughout the city. Players will not be able to stomp on Koopas until they have acquired Yoshi.[CR]Once the player has stomped a Koopa to reclaim an artifact, Luigi must take it back to the proper information booth. There, the player will be asked a series of questions by an information attendant, bearing resemblance to Princess Peach. If the player fails a certain number of questions, she will dismiss Luigi as a phony, and he will have to wait until the information booth is reopened to attempt to return the artifact again.[CR]Upon the successful returning and delivery, Luigi takes a picture of the fully restored artifact for his photo album. Players are able to view this photo album at any point in the game, along with the facts learned along the way about the important cultural piece.[CR]</plot>

<rom name="plugin://plugin.program.iarl/Emulator/NES_ZachMorris/Game/Mario%27s+Time+Machine+%28USA%29" size="109362"/>
<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mario's Time Machine is an educational game featuring Nintendo's mascot Mario and is part of the Mario Discovery Series, along with Mario is Missing! and the Mario's Early Years trio. Whereas Mario is Missing! taught younger players geography, Mario's Time Machine teaches world history instead. The SNES version was developed by The Software Toolworks in late 1993, and the NES version by Radical Entertainment the following year. There are minor differences between the two versions as a result.[CR]The goal is to take stolen items out of Bowser's museum, time-travel to the time period from which they hail (the location and date are important when imputting coordinates) and piece together information about the artifact and its owner by talking to NPCs from that era before they can be given back.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Title Screen of Mario's Time Machine[CR]Somehow Bowser has gotten a hold of a time machine, called the Timulator. Using the Timulator he goes back in time and steals many important artifacts of history. Bowser places all of these artifacts that he has taken into what he considers to be "the greatest museum of all time." Bowser will then destroy the Timulator after he is done building his collection, and therefore change the course of history forever.[CR]It is up to Mario to stop Browser from completing his collection of artifacts and return them to their respected time eras. If the artifacts are not brought back history will be changed permanently.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The basic gameplay consists of players talking to historic figures and solving basic puzzles in order to return artifacts to their rightful owners. Each object in Bowser's museum has attached to it a basic explanation of a famous historical figure, including the date and location the item was taken from. By imputing these co-ordinates into the Timulator, Mario can travel back to the correct era with the item in tow.[CR]When travelling back in time, players play a brief minigame where Mario travels trough an endless "ocean of time" with many whirlpools, and the objective is to grab enough mushrooms and deposit them into a wave pool in order to succesfully travel back in time. If Mario does not collect enough mushrooms before falling into a whirlpool or has imputed the wrong year/location combo, he travels back to the prehistoric era where he must play a version of Donkey Kong in order to get back to the museum where players can opt to try again.[CR]Once reaching the correct era, Mario can walk around and ask NPCs for hints. Most will provide at least one of the clues necessary to fill in the explanation provided with the item, and once this report is correctly filled in the item is given to its correct owner and the player can move onto the next.NES Version[CR]The NES version is a little different from the original SNES version. In this version, Mario has to fight Koopa Troopas in platforming sequences before being allowed to travel back in time. Mario also has no idea which artifact goes in which period (the SNES version informs the player as soon as they collect one of the artifacts) and must use the NPC hints to figure out which artifact is the right one for each period.[CR]Historical figures[CR]The historical figure that are featured in the game are:Cleopatra VIIElizabeth IFerdinand MagellanIssac NewtonJoan of ArcJohann GutenbergLeonardo de VinciLudwig van BeethovenMahatma GandhiMarco PoloMichelangeloPlatoThomas Alva EdisonThomas JeffersonWilliam Shakespeare[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released in 1993 Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the review scores of 7,7,6 and 7. Danyon Carpenter wrote, "I actually enjoyed Mario is Missing and I expected this one to be the same. Luckily, it is and it offers even more challenging quests than the first. Kiddies may have a tougher time with this one. For all you experienced gamers, the game will seem like a cakewalk, especially the Donkey Kong-like scenes and the surf boarding, but once you start reading those questions you'd better break out the history books".[CR]</plot>

<rom name="plugin://plugin.program.iarl/Emulator/NES_ZachMorris/Game/Super+Mario+Bros.+%28World%29" size="31505"/>
<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Mario Bros. title screen.[CR]Super Mario Bros. is a fantasy platformer created by  Shigeru Miyamoto, and published by  Nintendo. The game was released in 1985 for the  Nintendo Entertainment System. Super Mario Bros. has gone on to be considered by many to be one of the best platformers ever created. The  Guinness World Records Gamer’s Edition, a record keeping organization, declared Super Mario Bros. for the NES as the  best selling video game of all time with more than 40 million copies sold worldwide.[CR]Super Mario Bros. has two direct sequels, numerous spin-offs, and has also crossed mediums--most notably into television and movies. Super Mario Bros., the movie, was the first  movie to be based on a video game.  Mario, the main character of the game, is one of Nintendo’s most recognizable mascots, and has become so famous that he is recognized worldwide.[CR]The game has been released in a variety of forms. It has been released on the  Game Boy Advance,  Super Nintendo Entertainment System,  Nintendo Entertainment System,  Wii Virtual Console, and has been featured in  Animal Crossing as a game that can be obtained through use of an  Action Replay. The game was later repackaged in  Super Mario All-Stars, along with several other early  Super Mario games.[CR]The music for the game is composed by  Koji Kondo, also well known for his compositions in games such as  The Legend of Zelda. The game's iconic "Ground Theme" has been used in dozens of games since, and it is now considered the "theme song" of the  Mario series. The game's other songs, such as the Starman theme, underwater, underground, the game over jingle, and the castle themes have also been featured in dozens of future games, not limited to the Mario series.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR] The Mushroom Kingdom is invaded by the  Koopas. The Koopas are a tribe of turtle-like creatures versed in the ways of black magic. Using their black magic abilities they have turned all the Mushroom people into various objects like stones and bricks. Their leader, the evil Koopa King  Bowser, has kidnapped the only person who can undo the black magic that has trapped the Mushroom people,  Princess Toadstool. Mario hears of the plight of the Mushroom people, grabs his brother  Luigi, and sets out on a quest to free Princess Toadstool.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay of Super Mario Bros. is simple. The game has eight worlds, and each world has four sub-levels. Basically, Mario must travel through all eight worlds, avoiding obstacles and enemies along the way. At the end of each world is a castle, in which Mario must fight one of Bowser’s evil minions; with the exception of the last castle in which Mario fights Bowser himself.Mario swims through World 2-2.[CR]There were also several chances to  Warp ahead and skip levels. World 1-2 had the ability to warp to Worlds 2, 3 or 4, and World 4-2 had the ability to warp worlds 6, 7 and 8. This allowed for the  Speedruns to become common.[CR]The weapons in Mario's arsenal are not vast by any means. Mario can  jump on enemy’s heads, shoot  fireballs (by picking up a Fire Flower) at them, or use “Star Power” by picking up a Starman, which makes him an  invincible machine of destruction, laying waste to everything in his path. Mario can also use the occasional  Koopa shell to kill enemies. This four pronged offensive is how Mario will dispatch of most enemies, with the exception of Bowser and his castle minions. When it comes to the bosses of the game there is another way of dealing with them that is presented. Jumping on their heads will only get Mario killed, and there are no Starmen to be had during these instances. They can be killed with fireballs, if Mario somehow makes it to the end of the level with with that ability; but if Mario doesn't, there aren't many other approaches to dispatching these enemies.[CR]Mario begins the game with 3 lives, and can earn more by obtaining 1-up mushrooms, collecting 100  coins, or by jumping on multiple enemies (or a single enemy multiple times) without touching the ground. It is possible to earn many lives very quickly by using exploits such as repeatedly jumping on a Koopa shell, kicking it into a block, and jumping on it again as it returns. If Mario loses all his lives, the player is returned to the start screen.[CR]All of the the bosses in the game are standing on bridges over pits of lava, blocking the way to the end of the level. At the end of each bridge is an ax. Using a platform above the boss or running underneath the boss when he jumps, and then touching the ax at the end of the bridge will cause the bridge to collapse, sending the boss into the lava below.[CR]After each one of the “boss” battles a mushroom retainer (aka  Toads) is saved who says this  famous line, “Thank you Mario! But our princess is in another castle!” The exception is, of course, when Mario finally beats Bowser in World 8-4 and rescues  Princess Peach.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR] Mario - Main character of the game. The character the player assumes when playing the game in single player mode, and the character used by player one in two player mode. Bowser - King of the Koopas and the main boss of the game. Luigi - Secondary character of the game. Mario’s brother and character used by player two when in two player mode. Mushroom Retainer (Toads) - The mushroom person that is saved in the castles at the end of each world, with the exception of the last castle. Princess Toadstool - Princess of Mushroom Kingdom and the only one who can undo the Koopa’s black magic.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR] Blooper – Underwater squid-like creatures that must be killed with fireballs. Bullet Bill – Bullets that are fired, either with a cannon, or off-screen, at Mario. Buzzy Beetle – A tough beetle-like creature with a hard, outer shell that cannot be hurt by fire. Cheep Cheep – Red and yellow fish with white undersides. Under water this enemy must be killed using fireballs. Out of water they can be killed by fireball, jumping on them, or touching them when the player possesses "Star-Power." Goomba – A small mushroom like enemy with feet that is susceptible to any of the four main attack methods. Koopa Troopa – A turtle-like enemy. Jumping on this enemy will cause it to go into its shell, and if the shell is then jumped on it will send it traveling either right or left and take out any enemies in its path. This enemy is susceptible to any of the four main attack methods. Lakitu – A koopa who rides on a cloud, showering Mario with spiny eggs. These eggs turn into Spinies (see below). Paratroopa – Basically Koopa Troopas with wings. When jumped on, they lose their wings and turn into Koopa Troopas. This enemy is susceptible to any of the four main attack methods. Spiny – These koopas are thrown by Lakitu, and come covered in spikes. They can be hurt by fireballs, or when touched by a player possessing "Star-Power."[CR]Power Ups[CR] 1-UP – A green mushroom that grants Mario an extra life. Fire Flower – Gives Mario the ability to shoot fireballs. Mario must already be in the “Super” form to gain the fireball ability; otherwise it has the same affect as the Super Mushroom. Starman – Makes Mario or Luigi invincible, with the exception of falling into holes, and grants the ability to kill enemies just by touching them. Normally Mario must jump on an enemy, shoot it with fireballs, or use a Koopa shell to kill them. Super  Mushroom – This makes Mario bigger. In essence it transforms Mario or Luigi into “Super Mario” or “Super Luigi.” It also gives them the ability to take an extra hit; however, when hit they lose the “Super,” and are reduced to regular Mario or Luigi.[CR]Notable Ports and Remakes[CR] Vs. Super Mario Bros. All Night Nippon Super Mario Bros. Super Mario Bros. Special Super Mario Bros. Deluxe Super Mario All-Stars Super Mario All-Stars &amp; Super Mario World Classic NES Series: Super Mario Bros. Super Mario Bros. / Duck Hunt Super Mario Bros. / Duck Hunt / World Class Track Meet[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]In November 1986, the Milwaukee Journal described the original NES version of Super Mario Bros as "the best video game this year".[CR]In the March 1986 issue of Computer and Video Games, Clare Edgeley gave the arcade version, Vs. Super Mario Bros, a positive review.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Super Mario Bros. (and the Nintendo Entertainment System) were released at a major turning point in video game history, shortly after the infamous video game market crash in 1983 (caused by oversaturation of the market with budget, low-quality games). Marketed as more of a toy than a "video game console," the NES was able to find its success due, in part, to Super Mario Bros., which was offered along with a purchase of a new console, rendering it one of the best selling games of all time.[CR]The game popularized the "side-scrolling platformer" genre, inspiring clones and lookalikes for several generations following its initial release. Even the NES itself found dozens upon dozens of side-scrolling platformers released for it, indicative of Super Mario Bros.'s effect on game development.[CR]Since its release, Super Mario Bros. has been regarded as one of the most influential games of all time. It is consistently placed on official "top games of all time" lists, including lists from publications such as Nintendo Power, Electronic Gaming Monthly, IGN, Screw Attack, Game Informer, and many, many more.Release Date Controversy[CR]There is minor controversy regarding the actual date of Super Mario Bros.'s release. While the game's official release date in Japan is recorded and well known, its release date in North America is highly disputed, and even the year is uncertain. Several sources cite the release date as 1986, including video game historian Steven Kent.[CR]Official Nintendo sources state the release date is October 18, 1985, which is reciprocated in  Super Smash Bros. Brawl's "Chronicle" section. Supposedly, the game was released coinciding with the release of the NES, however, its original release date is also lost. Other possible release dates include October 12, October 19, and another official Nintendo provided date of November 17, 1985.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Access 5-1 from 1-2[CR]To access this warp, you must be Super or Fiery Mario. Go to the pipe at the end of the level and jump on top of it. Jump up and break the block over top of the part of the pipe farthest left. Then, position Mario on the edge of the pipe, with one foot hanging off the edge. Duck, then jump backwards as far right as possible.  If done just right, Mario will slide through the pipe and the bricks. Walk over to the warp zone area and enter the middle pipe. This pipe will take you to world 5, level 1. The same area can be acessed from a pipe in the same place in 4-2. However, this is meant to be a warp zone to 5-1, whereas the 1-2 warp to 5-1 is a glitch. After completing the jump trick in level 1-2, you can also go down either of the other two pipes, both of which will take you to Minus World -1. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] World Select[CR]After beating the game, if you do not turn off the console, you will return to the title screen. There, you can press the B Button to start as desired in World 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Blooper Dodge[CR]If you just walk along the sea floor, Bloopers will never be able to kill you because they are forced back up just before they hit the floor(or you).</plot>

<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Mario Bros. 2 (known in Japan as Super Mario USA) is a 2D sidescrolling platformer developed and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System on October 1988. It is both the American sequel to Super Mario Bros. (not to be confused with the Japanese sequel of the same name, later known as Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels) and a re-skinned version of Nintendo's 1987 Japan-exclusive platformer Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic.[CR]The game begins as some inhabitants of the Mushroom Kingdom (hero plumber Mario, his brother Luigi, the kingdom's princess, and the princess's attendant Toad) were going on a picnic before finding a magical door in a nearby cave. Through the door, they enter the mysterious world of Sub-Con, where its inhabitants (the Subcons) are under siege by monsters ruled by the maniacal toad king Wart. Players control the four heroes as they venture through Sub-Con, defeating Wart's minions and navigating dangerous obstacles.[CR]Because the game is a re-skin of a different game, Super Mario Bros. 2 is different from traditional Super Mario platformers. For example, jumping on the heads of enemies do not affect them, and players can carry enemies by standing on them and picking them up. Enemies are defeated by either throwing them off the screen, throwing them at other enemies, or by throwing a special POW block. Several enemies (such as the mischievous Shy Guys and the unusual Birdo) and concepts (such as Luigi's tall, thin appearance and the exploding Bob-ombs) have carried over to other games in the Mario franchise.[CR]A 16-bit remake was created for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993 as part of Super Mario All-Stars. This remake adds some enhancements, such as allowing players to switch characters after losing a life and increasing the amount of lives given. This version was further re-made for the Game Boy Advance on June 11, 2001 as Super Mario Advance, adding a variety of new features (including the "Yoshi Challenge", in which players re-visit stages to find hidden Yoshi eggs, and a new point-scoring system). The original re-make was also released in weekly parts (as BS Super Mario USA: Power Challenge) for the Japan-exclusive Stellaview satellite modem add-on from March 1996 to April 1996. The original game was released for the Wii (via Wii Virtual Console) on July 2, 2007.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Super Mario Bros. 2 is a standard side-scrolling platformer where players must traverse through 20 stages (split into seven unique areas, called Worlds), defeating various enemies and navigating dangerous obstacles in order to find mystical orbs (which trigger special doorways, called Hawkmouths, that lead to the next stage). Before a new stage is played (or after a continue from losing all lives), players can switch between four characters (each with their own unique abilities and attributes):Mario - The titular hero and red-suited plumber, Mario is the most balanced character of the four.Luigi - Mario's brother and a green-suited plumber, Luigi is not as fast as Mario (and does not pick up items as fast), but he has the highest jumping power in the game.Toad - The princess's attendant, Toad has the weakest jumping ability in the game, but is the fastest character (in both movement and picking up items).Princess - The princess of the Mushroom Kingdom is the slowest character in the game (in terms of both movement and picking up items) and does not jump as high as Mario, but she has the ability to temporarily float in the air (by holding down the jump button while in the air).[CR]Players use the "A" button to jump and the "B" button to run, pick up objects/enemies, and throw held objects/enemies. Holding down the Jump button, rather than tapping it, causes the character to jump higher. Holding the down direction on the d-pad causes the character to charge up a "super jump", in which the next jump will be even higher than usual.[CR]Unlike traditional Mario games, where the hero defeats enemies by jumping on them, Super Mario Bros. 2 requires players to dispose enemies by either throwing them off the screen, throwing them at other enemies, or by throwing other objects (such as vegetables) at them.[CR]Sub-Space and Warping[CR]Luigi entering Sub-Space in Level 1-1, finding a secret Mushroom item.[CR]In each level, the player can find a special flask (the Magic Potion) which, when thrown, summons a door to a unique parallel area called Sub-Space. In Sub-Space, the screen does not scroll, there are no enemies, and players can find special items (including coins for the slot machine minigame and mushrooms to extend the life gauge for the rest of the level). After a short amount of time, the player is automatically brought back to Sub-Con.[CR]In addition, carrying the Magic Potion to one of four unique areas in the game, then entering a mystical and hidden Warp Jar, causes the player to warp to a further World (in similar fashion to hidden Warp Zones in Super Mario Bros.):From a hidden jar in World 1-3, players can warp to World 4-1.From a hidden jar in World 3-1, players can warp to World 5-1.From a hidden jar in World 4-2, players can warp to World 6-1.From a hidden jar in World 5-3, players can warp to World 7-1.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Suicide[CR]While playing, pause the game, hold Up, B &amp; A on controller 2 and unpause.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Double Jump - 2 Methods[CR]Method 1:[CR]Use any character and run right toward an enemy at full speed. Just a split second before you think you're about to get hit, jump! With good timing you'll be able to jump yet again in midair! [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Warp to World 4[CR]Go to world 1-3 and find a potion. Now find the vase next to the brick building all the way to the right side of the level. Drop the potion and go into Sub-Space and then warp into the vase (stand on top of it and press down) You will warp to World 4!</plot>

<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The title screen.[CR]Released in the United States in 1990, Super Mario Bros. 3 was one of the most highly anticipated games of its time. Nintendo's promotional campaign leading up to the game's release was unprecedented for a video game in the US, and included a key role in the climactic moments of the video-game-themed movie The Wizard. While the film was universally panned by movie critics and video gamers alike, it was successful in its ulterior purpose of promoting Super Mario Bros. 3.[CR]Super Mario Bros. 3 is generally considered to be one of the Nintendo Entertainment System's best, one of the greatest Nintendo games of all time, and also one of the best Mario games ever created. It was noted for being the top selling video game of all time, before being surpassed by Wii Sports.[CR]The game's popularity has resulted in a few ports and remakes, including Super Mario All-Stars (a compilation of early Mario games), Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3, and a Virtual Console port.[CR]Shigeru Miyamoto returned as lead designer along with Takashi Tezuka, and Koji Kondo as the game's music composer.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Super Mario Bros. 3 brings back the series' traditional gameplay.[CR]The gameplay in Super Mario Bros. 3 is more akin to the original Super Mario Bros. than the deviation found in Super Mario Bros. 2. The game also expands on and introduces many new concepts, some of which stayed for future Mario titles. Notably, Super Mario Bros. 3 was the first Mario game to feature a world map, allowing the player a certain level of freedom, including the occasional opportunity to skip sections of levels.[CR]The game follows the traditional formula of Mario chasing down Bowser to rescue the kidnapped Princess Peach, though this time around Mario also has to deal with Bowser's children and their powerful airships.[CR]Because of the new world map, certain areas are blocked by Hammer Bros., which Mario must defeat (or he can put them to sleep using an item found in the game). Along with these dangerous obstacles, there are minigames found in a Toad's house. The minigames allow Mario to win items such as Super Mushrooms that can be stored in a bar at the bottom of the screen for future use in individual levels.[CR]Super Mario Bros. 3 also includes a simultaneous multiplayer mode. Player one controls Mario while player two controls Luigi, as the two traverse the game's eight worlds. Through this mode, even more minigames are accessible, including a retouched version of the original Mario Bros.[CR][B]Worlds:[/B][CR]Grass Land is the first world.Grass Land (World One) - Grass Land is a basic Mario world, featuring a mix of slightly varied Mario environments such as straightforward outdoor stages, auto-scrolling stages that take place in the air, and even an underground stage. It is the smallest world in the game, its map taking up only one screen.Desert Land (World Two) - A desert world, as the name implies. Quicksand becomes a common obstacle, and one stage takes place inside of a pyramid.Water Land (World Three) - This world takes place next to the ocean. Levels begin to take place underwater, and even levels that are not underwater usually feature water of some kind.Giant Land (World Four) - Giant Land is very similar to Grass Land. The difference is that enemies and objects are all more than twice their normal size! Even so, most of them can be destroyed with the same amount of effort.Sky Land (World Five) - The first half of sky land is also similar to Grass Land. However, the tower stage that exists at the midpoint of this level will take Mario up into the sky, which means that the latter half of this world is composed mostly of air stages.Ice Land (World Six) - Ice Land's stages are all covered in ice. Mario will slip on ice if he is not carefully controlled, making control even more important than ever.Pipe Land (World Seven) - Pipe Land's stages feature an abundance of pipes! While the environments may be similar to Grass Land, pipes are absolutely everywhere in these stages, and Piranha Plants come with them.Dark Land (World Eight) - Dark Land features many stages that are similar to the auto-scrolling airship stages that end the other worlds. It does eventually feature a few "normal" stages that resemble earlier worlds, but even these appear to take place at night. Watch out, because nearly every enemy in the game can appear at any time. At the end waits Bowser's Castle.[CR]Power-Ups[CR]Super Mario Bros. 3 brings back the old powers from the first game, and it also adds some new, more abstract upgrades.Super Mushroom[CR]The classic Super Mario Bros. item returns in Super Mario Bros. 3. It turns Mario into Super Mario, allowing him to take one more hit before he dies.Fire Flower[CR]The Fire Flower is another classic Super Mario Bros. item. It gives Mario the ability to shoot fireballs and quickly destroy enemies. If he is hurt, Mario reverts to his Super Mario stage.Raccoon SuitTanooki Suit[CR]A new item, this gives Mario the ability to fly for short periods of time. If he runs for a while and gets his P-Meter high up, Mario can soar through the sky. Pressing B makes Mario spin, which slows down his descent and hits enemies that get whacked by the raccoon tail.Frog Suit[CR]The Frog Suit is another new item, giving Mario the ability to swim faster in the water. However, he hops around on land, making him harder to control.Tanooki Suit[CR]Very similar to the Raccoon Suit, this item allows Mario to turn into a stone statue, making him invincible to enemies. In addition to that, it has all of the abilities of the Raccoon Suit.Hammer Bro. SuitHammer Bro. Suit[CR]The Hammer Bro. Suit gives Mario the ability to throw hammers. Mario can also go into the shell and protect himself from enemies.Kuribo's ShoeKuribo's Shoe[CR]A unique power-up, this allows Mario to stomp around in a giant Goomba's shoe. He is impervious to attack from below while he is in Kuribo's Shoe, like Piranha Plants. It is only available in level 5-3. The shoe has not appeared as a power up in any game since Super Mario Bros. 3Starman[CR]Another classic Super Mario Bros. power-up, this makes Mario temporarily invincible. In certain levels, Mario can string Starmen one after the other to the end of a level by hitting the right blocks along the way before running out of invincibility.Warp Whistle[CR]A rare power-up that could only be found in some areas, this lets Mario skip a world at any time, mimicking the pipe zones from the first game. Mario can only move between tiers of levels in this way, so the tiers were: Worlds 2-4, Worlds 5-7, and World 8.[CR]Bowser's Children[CR]Bowser's seven children are the bosses of each world preceding World Eight (Dark Land), in which the player faces Bowser himself. Each child is actually named after a famous musician. Each Koopa is felled after three hits.Larry Koopa[CR]Larry has no real special abilities beyond jumping high after taking two hits. He is the boss of Grass Land. It is uncertain who Larry is actually named after, but it is speculated to be Lawrence Welk, a well-known accordionist.Morton Koopa, Jr.[CR]Morton is the boss of Desert Land, and the second youngest of the Koopalings. He is loud-mouthed and hot-tempered. While his facial features (the star on his left eye) resemble those of KISS member Paul Stanley, Morton is actually named after Morton Downey, Jr. (which also explains the "Jr." in Morton's name, not insinuating that Bowser's real name is Morton).Wendy O. Koopa[CR]Wendy is the only female Koopaling, and also the only Koopaling to have completely circular magical attacks. She is the third youngest, and is often portrayed as a whiny, spoiled brat. Wendy is named after Wendy O. Williams, the singer for the band The Plasmatics.Iggy Koopa[CR]Iggy is the middle child of the Koopalings. He is considered a "genius", particularly in the cartoons, where he is twin brothers with Lemmy Koopa. His in-game representation differs from his artwork, in which he sports a rainbow mohawk. In-game, he lacks this, and only has a blonde tuft of hair. Iggy is named after the influential punk artist Iggy Pop.Roy Koopa[CR]Roy is the third oldest Koopaling. He is a bully, and enjoys seeing others' pain. He is the largest of the Koopalings, and thus, the worst at jumping. However, when he lands, he causes a ground-shaking blast, which stuns the player if they are still on the ground. Roy is based on Roy Orbison, who inspired Roy Koopa's shades.Lemmy Koopa[CR]Lemmy is the only Koopaling to ride around on a green ball. He uses this same green ball as a weapon in some cases, launching it with his magic wand. He is the second oldest of the Koopalings, and is based on Ian "Lemmy" Kilmister of the band Motörhead.Ludwig von Koopa[CR]The oldest of the Koopa kids, Ludwig is also able to create ground-shaking blasts like Roy Koopa. Naturally, he is based on the famous composer Ludwig van Beethoven, and even has a hairstyle similar to that of the well-known German composer.[CR]TV Series[CR]The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3.[CR]In addition to the video game itself, Super Mario Bros. 3 also has a TV show and it is called The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3. The show introduced the Koopalings and it is the second Mario animated series following The Super Mario Bros. Super Show. The show was produced by Nintendo in association with DiC Entertainment and spanned a total of 26 episodes.[CR]The Wizard[CR]The game as seen in the finals of the video game tournament in The Wizard.[CR]The game also appeared in the last scene of The Wizard where Jimmy Woods competed in the final round of the video game tournament. In this scene, Jimmy, Lucas, and Mora battled in the final round where the rules was to get the most points in 10 minutes using the game. At the final 60 seconds of play, Jimmy used a Warp Whistle to give him big points and the win.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Avoid Damage From Bowser[CR]When fighting Bowser in the final level of the game, his lower half will not do damage to you. That means you can avoid damage from his ground-pound attack by ducking if you have obtained a power-up at some point, or, if Small Mario, you can walk under him and through him without sustaining damage![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 28 P-Wings[CR]Complete the game and watch the ending. Now start a new game. You got 28 P-Wings! [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Fight Bowser With No Fireballs[CR]In Bowsers castle at the end of the game, it is possible to make it so he DOES NOT SPIT FIRE AT YOU.  This trick is easy and only requires getting to world 8 with a P-wing.  First off, use your P-wing on the map before entering the Final Castle.  YOU MUST GET TO BOWSER INTACT.  If you get to the Bowser fight room and the Bricks that he smashes through are not flush with the rest of the floor, then you are in the wrong room.  Now, when you reach Bowsers room, FLY straight up and to the left.  You will be able to walk on a wall above the screen.  Drop down on the other side. You will be in another room to Fight Bowser in.  When you drop, you will be on a door that opens to the princess.  Ignore this room and DO NOT GO TOO FAR TO THE LEFT.  If you do, you will have to fight Bowser and he will still have his Fire Balls. Fly back over the wall to the first room you were in and start the Bowser fight.  He will still throw his head back and make the sound of spitting fire, but nothing will come out.   ;)</plot>

<plot>Two of the most popular puzzle games return, but now together in an exclusive compilation for SNES. The games have a slight graphical update when compared with the original Game Boy and NES games, but the gameplay remains totally faithful to the games released for both platforms.[CR]In Tetris, the main objective is to pile blocks that will fall down continuously, in order to create a row or "line" without spaces. For this collection, the game comes with two bonus options: 2 PLAYER GAME (absent in the NES version) and VS. COM (absent in both versions), with 3 CPU opponents available, each one representing a difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD, respectively).[CR]In Dr. Mario, the objective is to eliminate all the viruses contained in a big bottle. Dr. Mario (situated in the upper-right side of the screen) will throw capsules with 6 different color combinations (Red-Red, Red-Blue, Yellow-Yellow, Red-Yellow, Blue-Blue and Blue-Yellow) in order to line up at least four viruses or capsules of the same color horizontally or vertically and to make them disappear. In this compilation, the game comes with a bonus option: VS. COM, where you'll face the CPU players: Blue Virus (EASY), Yellow Virus (MEDIUM), and Red Virus (HARD).[CR]For competitive players in both games, there is Mixed Match, where you and a friend can play Tetris and Dr. Mario like a tournament! Adjust the handicap levels, play time, music, and other settings to balance your different skills. The game order is: TETRIS B-TYPE (clear a certain amount of lines), DR. MARIO (disinfect a predetermined number of viruses) and TETRIS A-TYPE (clear lines until the time expires). At the end of the time limit, the player with the highest score is the winner.</plot>

<rom name="plugin://plugin.program.iarl/Emulator/SNES_ZachMorris/Game/Mario+Is+Missing%21+%28USA%29" size="925487"/>
<plot>[CR][B]Summary:[/B][CR]Mario is Missing is one of Nintendo's many entries into the "edutainment" genre, and one of the few Nintendo games to feature the Mario brother Luigi as the main playable character.[CR]Mario is Missing is a unique Mario game in that the action does not occur in the Mushroom Kingdom, but rather on terrestrial Earth, set in a time contemporary to the game's release date. The visual style of the game is borrowed its SNES contemporary Super Mario World, from the title's font to the overworld city maps.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Even the greats have bad days.[CR]Mario sets off towards Bowser's castle to stop Bowser's evil plan of covering the world in water by melting Antarctica. It is later discovered that Bowser plans to melt the continent with a large number of hair dryers, purchased with money gained from stolen valuable artifacts from across the Earth.[CR]While Luigi is hesitant to enter Bowser's castle, Mario makes a bold entrance, only to be captured moments later. Luigi must then enter the castle solo, searching through each of the dungeon's warp doors for Mario, while at the same time recovering all of the stolen artifacts from Bowser's loyal Koopas. Upon returning each stolen artifact, more doors to the castle unlock, allowing Luigi to search more places until he eventually reaches Antarctica to save his brother and stop Bowser from his evil plan.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]From the warp doors in Bowser's castle, players are transported to various cities across the world. Here, by the flyers attached to tourist information booths, Luigi discovers that the Koopas have stolen culturally significant artifacts. Luigi is able to speak to other people populating the town, ranging from a professor, to a schoolboy, to a police woman. The player gathers clues to correctly identify the missing artifacts, such as the Sistine Chapel painting, or the Forbidden City. To gather additional clues, Luigi also has access to a computer and telephone, both from which he can learn about the missing artifacts. Luigi can call general information, and also receives calls from Mario from time to time, giving tips on generic gameplay.Save the world, or keep the flute. Hmm...[CR]Players also have access to an overworld map, showing the street connections, as well as Koopa and warp pipe locations. Being in the real world, Luigi is also able to speed up travel by taking a taxi cab across town, or out to hard to reach places, such as Alcatraz Island.[CR]A map showing the entire world, called the Globulator, allows players to control Yoshi, as he hops from continent to continent. When the player places Yoshi on the correct city of Luigi's location, Yoshi appears on the stage with him, and Luigi is able to ride the dinosaur throughout the city. Players will not be able to stomp on Koopas until they have acquired Yoshi.[CR]Once the player has stomped a Koopa to reclaim an artifact, Luigi must take it back to the proper information booth. There, the player will be asked a series of questions by an information attendant, bearing resemblance to Princess Peach. If the player fails a certain number of questions, she will dismiss Luigi as a phony, and he will have to wait until the information booth is reopened to attempt to return the artifact again.[CR]Upon the successful returning and delivery, Luigi takes a picture of the fully restored artifact for his photo album. Players are able to view this photo album at any point in the game, along with the facts learned along the way about the important cultural piece.[CR]</plot>

<rom name="plugin://plugin.program.iarl/Emulator/SNES_ZachMorris/Game/Mario%27s+Time+Machine+%28USA%29" size="933599"/>
<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mario's Time Machine is an educational game featuring Nintendo's mascot Mario and is part of the Mario Discovery Series, along with Mario is Missing! and the Mario's Early Years trio. Whereas Mario is Missing! taught younger players geography, Mario's Time Machine teaches world history instead. The SNES version was developed by The Software Toolworks in late 1993, and the NES version by Radical Entertainment the following year. There are minor differences between the two versions as a result.[CR]The goal is to take stolen items out of Bowser's museum, time-travel to the time period from which they hail (the location and date are important when imputting coordinates) and piece together information about the artifact and its owner by talking to NPCs from that era before they can be given back.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Title Screen of Mario's Time Machine[CR]Somehow Bowser has gotten a hold of a time machine, called the Timulator. Using the Timulator he goes back in time and steals many important artifacts of history. Bowser places all of these artifacts that he has taken into what he considers to be "the greatest museum of all time." Bowser will then destroy the Timulator after he is done building his collection, and therefore change the course of history forever.[CR]It is up to Mario to stop Browser from completing his collection of artifacts and return them to their respected time eras. If the artifacts are not brought back history will be changed permanently.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The basic gameplay consists of players talking to historic figures and solving basic puzzles in order to return artifacts to their rightful owners. Each object in Bowser's museum has attached to it a basic explanation of a famous historical figure, including the date and location the item was taken from. By imputing these co-ordinates into the Timulator, Mario can travel back to the correct era with the item in tow.[CR]When travelling back in time, players play a brief minigame where Mario travels trough an endless "ocean of time" with many whirlpools, and the objective is to grab enough mushrooms and deposit them into a wave pool in order to succesfully travel back in time. If Mario does not collect enough mushrooms before falling into a whirlpool or has imputed the wrong year/location combo, he travels back to the prehistoric era where he must play a version of Donkey Kong in order to get back to the museum where players can opt to try again.[CR]Once reaching the correct era, Mario can walk around and ask NPCs for hints. Most will provide at least one of the clues necessary to fill in the explanation provided with the item, and once this report is correctly filled in the item is given to its correct owner and the player can move onto the next.NES Version[CR]The NES version is a little different from the original SNES version. In this version, Mario has to fight Koopa Troopas in platforming sequences before being allowed to travel back in time. Mario also has no idea which artifact goes in which period (the SNES version informs the player as soon as they collect one of the artifacts) and must use the NPC hints to figure out which artifact is the right one for each period.[CR]Historical figures[CR]The historical figure that are featured in the game are:Cleopatra VIIElizabeth IFerdinand MagellanIssac NewtonJoan of ArcJohann GutenbergLeonardo de VinciLudwig van BeethovenMahatma GandhiMarco PoloMichelangeloPlatoThomas Alva EdisonThomas JeffersonWilliam Shakespeare[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released in 1993 Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the review scores of 7,7,6 and 7. Danyon Carpenter wrote, "I actually enjoyed Mario is Missing and I expected this one to be the same. Luckily, it is and it offers even more challenging quests than the first. Kiddies may have a tougher time with this one. For all you experienced gamers, the game will seem like a cakewalk, especially the Donkey Kong-like scenes and the surf boarding, but once you start reading those questions you'd better break out the history books".[CR]				</plot>

<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]One of the game's earlier levels[CR]Developed and published by Nintendo, Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island represents a departure in the standard platforming formula that Super Mario had become known for. In this prequel to the other Mario titles, players no longer control Mario; instead, they control Mario's green side-kick, Yoshi. Mario himself is in the game and always with Yoshi, but it's not the plumber that players had grown used to; instead Mario returns as a baby, riding on Yoshi's back as Yoshi journeys through various levels on his way to Baby Bowser's castle to save Mario's brother Luigi. Not only did this represent a major shift for the Super Mario series, it also marked a shift in visual design as well. Yoshi's Island used much more colorful palettes than other titles and appears much more stylized. Most objects and environments have much bolder lines and larger contrasts in colors, which gives itself a much more artistic, childish, and hand-drawn feel. Yoshi's Island was originally released on the Super Nintendo.[CR]In 2002, Yoshi's Island was re-released on the Game Boy Advance under the name Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3. Yoshi's Island received its first sequel in 2006 on the Nintendo DS, titled Yoshi's Island DS. The story was a follow up to Yoshi's Island, though not a direct sequel, and not nearly as well received.[CR]There are 6 different worlds in Yoshi's Island, each one with a different theme. World 1 is a field theme, World 2 has a forest theme, World 3 is a jungle, World 4 contains a variety of themes, World 5 has a snowy theme, and World 6 has a dystopic theme. World 6 is the final area of the game, where Yoshi faces off against Kamek and young Bowser.[CR]Yoshi's Island was the first major Mario title that did not contain any form of a warp zone, allowing players to transport themselves further into the game. To complete Yoshi's Island, players were required to complete all of the game's 48 regular stages, though getting 100% completion was a much more daunting task with the many bonus levels featured in the title.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story begins[CR]Our tale begins as a stork carries two peaceful young children over the tranquil ocean. All seems well, however, danger rears its ugly head as the evil magikoopa Kamek arrives, swiping Baby Luigi. He attempts to kidnap both infants, but fails, leaving baby Mario to plummet down into the ocean. Mario falls towards a small island in the great expanse of water, home of the Yoshis, an island called Yoshi's Island. Luckily for our young friend, he lands safely on the back of a bright green yoshi. Mario somehow makes Yoshi and his multi-colored friends aware of the catastrophe, and the entire tribe of dinosaurs enlists in the fight. Together, these yoshis will in turn carry Mario through dangerous terrain and, against all odds, rescue Baby Luigi and defeat Kamek. This is exactly what happens, as well. After a long, perilous journey across Yoshi's island's most threatening terrain whilst being pursued by Baby Bowser's minions, the Yoshi's arrive at Baby Bowser's castle. They fight with great strenght against both Bowser and Kamek, and come out the victors. Baby Mario and Luigi are both safe, and all is well in the world.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Yoshi scrambling to get baby Mario back.[CR]Yoshi's Island introduces a plethora of new moves for Yoshi now that he has become the main character. Many of the moves that he has since become known for were first developed in this title, including his ability to hover by kicking his feet furiously for a few seconds. Yoshi's ability to create eggs from enemies and then use them as weapons was also introduced in this title. Throughout his adventures, Yoshi can accumulate up to six eggs that can be used to reach far off switches and collectibles or to simply eliminate enemies. Occasionally, players will have to get keys or other objects that will replace an egg in the line up following YoshiShooting eggs.[CR]to unlock or advance in a level. Unlike other Mario titles, Yoshi does not have a finite amount of health (he can be killed instantly by pits, lava, spikes and other such hazards though). Instead, players will have to rescue Baby Mario within a certain time-limit whenever Yoshi is hit. Throughout a level, the timer will refill back to the default 10 seconds, but a player can collect objects, such as bouncing starmen (not to be confused with ones from other Super Mario titles that provide invulnerability), that will increase the limit up to 30 seconds.[CR]Hidden throughout each level are a number of extras which players can collect. Part of the challenge of each level includes collecting these items, which are red coins and flowers. Each level has 20 red coins and 5 flowers. Tthe red coins simply serve as a collectible, but the flowers give the player an increased chance of playing a mini-game once they complete the level. If a player collects all of the items in a level and finishes with 30 seconds on their timer, they receive a perfect score of 100 for that level.[CR]Some levels require Yoshi to collect a transformation power-up that transforms Yoshi into a vehicle for a limited amount of time. Yoshi can become a helicopter, letting him fly; a car, which increases his speed, but he must avoid enemies; a submarine, which lets him shoot torpedoes that home onto enemies; a train, which rides on rails, but must avoid other enemies also on the tracks; and a mole vehicle that can dig through certain obstacles. During any vehicle segment, players don't have to worry about losing Baby Mario, but still must complete the segment before the transformation wears off. When a player successfully reaches the end of the segment, Yoshi and Baby Mario are reunited and the level continues.[CR]On a few rare occasions, Yoshi has a chance to nab a "super star," altering Baby Mario into the 'Super Baby Mario' form, also causing Mario to don a cape. This marks a turn of events for the game where the player controls Baby Mario rather then his scaly chauffer. Baby Mario can run at the speed of light up walls and across ceilings and has an improved ability to jump and glide. Many times, Mario can nab hard-to-reach items and plenty of coins. This power up is seldom seen, and only lasts for a very short period of time, so make good use of it.A stage map where players pick the level they wish to play.[CR]At the end of each level, players jump through a goal hoop that will randomly reward the player with a mini-game. After that, players are scored out of 100 points depending on how many red coins they collected, how many of the five hidden flowers they found throughout the stage (which will also improve the chance of entering a mini-game) and how much time is left on the countdown timer. After the player receives their score, the Yoshi carrying Baby Mario hands him off to the next Yoshi that will carry Baby Mario through the next level. There six worlds altogether, each of which consists of eight levels that players must clear in order. Players can also unlock hidden bonus stages that add an extra challenge. Players can pick any stage they've previously beaten, in an attempt to get a better score or find any other hidden secrets. Each world has two castle areas where players have to face off against a boss which all have different weaknesses players must discover and are not necessarily as "generic" as the bosses seen in other Mario titles that all have similar weaknesses.Extra Stages[CR]The extra stages are a series of optional stages that can be accessed if the player reaches a standard of points in specific worlds. Perfect scores are not required, however, the standards are not easy, and so a high score is required for most levels in a world. The extra stages prove to be much more challenging then the main stages throughout the game, only the elite could conquer a few of these stages.[CR]These stages are:Extra 1: Poochy aint StupidExtra 2: Hit that switch!!Extra 3: More Monkey MadnessExtra 4: The Impossible? MazeExtra 5: Kamek's RevengeExtra 6: Castles - Masterpiece setMini Games[CR]On every level, the player has a chance to play one of many mini-games. Some stages only allow access to mini-games through the end of stage roulette, however, there are special doors on some levels that give accessA bonus challenge[CR]to games. Certain levels will have small hut like buildings with locked doors. If the player can locate the key to the door, they can go inside and participate in a mini-game. These mini-games can provide the player with bonuses if they are successful.[CR]Throwing Balloons: In this mini-game, Yoshi and the bandit will toss a balloon to each other across the screen. As they toss the balloon, it will continue to grow larger and larger. Once it gets so big that it pops, the character holding it loses.[CR]Popping Balloons: popping balloons has Yoshi competing against the bandit to see who can pop the right balloon. The characters run across the small level, ground-pounding all of the balloons. Whoever pops the correct balloon is the winner.[CR]Gather Coins: Once again, Yosih is pitted against the bandit. This game has a cannon which moves across the screen, and shooting out coins into the air as it moves. The player must try and collect as many coins as possible. Once the game is over, the character with the most coins wins.[CR]Watermelon Seed Spitting Contest: This game puts Yoshi in combat against the bandit, both wielding watermelon seeds. Pots are scattered across the screen, each one with a watermelon in it. The characters collect the watermelons and eat them, then, as if they were a machine gun, spit out the seeds at eachother. Both characters have life, and whoever loses all of their life first is the loser.[CR]Game Boy Advance version[CR]On September 22, 2002, Nintendo released the GBA port of Yoshi's island, titled Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island. Essentially, the games were identical aside from the obvious change in resolution. Nintendo added voice samples from the Nintendo 64 game Yoshi's Story, and changed the music in the GBA version of the game.Yoshi fighting Bowser off in the distance.[CR]One major change to the game was the addition of six new "secret levels" that a player could unlock once they had completed the game. These secret levels are completely seperate from the extra levels found in the SNES version, though those levels are also present in the port. In order to get these levels, players were required to obtain a score of 100 on all of the games 60 levels by collecting all that can be found on each level. Once they have these scores and have defeated bowser, a yellow box will appear on the level select menu with the word "secret" in it.[CR]The secret levels are as follows:Secret Level 1: Exercise in the SkiesSecret Level 2: Mystery of the Castle?Secret Level 3: Go! Go! MorphingSecret Level 4: Fight Toadies with ToadiesSecret Level 5: Items are fun!Secret Level 6: Endless world of YoshisThe GBA version of the game[CR]There were also a few changes to the GBA version. In Extra level 3, 'More Monkey Madness,' a single red coin was removed taking the total on the level from 21 to 20.[CR]The GBA version of Yoshi's Island also featured a remake of the classic arcade game Mario Bros., as did other game boy advance Mario ports. Yoshi's Island was the first of the Mario advance series to allow players to put the game boy into a 'sleep' mode, which allowed them to put the game boy into powersave at any time without losing progress.[CR]Game Credits[CR]Executive Producer - Hiroshi YamauchiProducer - Shigeru MiyamotoDirector - Takashi TezukaDirector - Toshihiko NakagoDirector - Shigefumi HinoDirector - Hideki KonnoChief Programmer - Toshio IwawakiMain Programmer - Masaru NiiMain Programmer - Kiyoshi KodaMain Programmer - Satoru TakahataMain Programmer - Kazuaki MoritaMain Programmer - Yuichi YamamotoMain Programmer - Yasunori TaketaniCourse - Level Design - Yasuhisa YamamuraCourse - Level Design - Kenta UsuiCourse - Level Design - Yoshihiro NomotoCourse - Level Design - Eiji NotoCharacter Design Shigefumi HinoCharacter Design - Hisashi NogamiCharacter Design - Masahiro IimuraCharacter Design - Tomoaki KuroumeGraphic Design - Yoshiaki KoizumiSound Composition - Koji KondoTechnical Support - Takao SawanoMap Director - Hidequi KonnoArea Director - Katsuya EguchiProgram Director - Toshihiko NakagoMain Programmer - Shigeki Yoshida[CR]		</plot>

<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Mario All-Stars Title Screen.[CR]Super Mario All-Stars is a game developed by Nintendo and released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993. The title was designed as a definitive collection of four previous Mario titles that had been released on the original NES. Thanks to the enhanced capabilities of the SNES over its predecessor, each of the Mario games appeared with graphical face lifts, adding more detailed graphics and animation, as well as remixed soundtracks. The game also includes a save system, allowing the player to save their progress before quitting.[CR]The titles included in Super Mario All Stars are:Super Mario Bros.Super Mario Bros. 2Super Mario Bros. 3Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels[CR]Additionally, Nintendo released an updated version of the game in North America in 1994 as an SNES pack-in game. This new version included the four previously listed games as well as the SNES launch title Super Mario World. This version is titled Super Mario All-Stars &amp; Super Mario World.[CR]The Lost Levels[CR]The Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 is included under the title "The Lost Levels."[CR]Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels is the original Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2. It wasn't released in North America until its inclusion in Super Mario All-Stars. The North American Super Mario Bros. 2, a heavily modified and redesigned version of the game Yume Kojo: Doki Doki Panic, had previously been released in Japan under the name Super Mario USA. As a proper sequel built from the foundation set by the original Super Mario Bros., The Lost Levels contains many of the same design aesthetics and gameplay aspects, but with a much greater degree of challenge. It also removed the option of a two-player game but allowed players to play as either Mario or Luigi, and gave the brothers different abilities. While Mario controls essentially the same as he did in the first game, Luigi is given a much higher jump at the cost of less traction on the ground.[CR]Nintendo Wii Release[CR]Box art for the Wii's Anniversary Edition.[CR]In 2010, Super Mario All-Stars was rereleased on the Wii to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the original Super Mario Bros. The game was notable as it was the only way to play the updated versions of the games on the Wii. (The virtual console version of the games are just ports of the NES version) In addition to the game, the package also included a thirty-two page booklet containing artwork and comments from Nintendo staff members and a CD containing tracks from games ranging from the original Super Mario Bros. to Super Mario Galaxy 2. The album also contains ten original sound effects and short music clips from the original game, including the coin-collection sound effect, the power up/power down sounds, and the Game Over theme. The pack was released in Japan on October 21, 2010, in Europe on December 3, 2010, and in the U.S. on December 12, 2010.[CR]The content of this edition of Super Mario All-Stars is identical to its original 1993 release. It can be played using either the Wii Remote by itself, a Classic Controller, or a GameCube controller, though all in-game controller graphics still reference the standard SNES controller.[CR]On February 15, 2011, after nearly two million copies sold worldwide, Nintendo announced it would do one final run of Super Mario All-Stars for the Wii. This last run shipped to retailers in North America on March 13, 2011.[CR]Super Mario History 1985-2010 Soundtrack CD[CR]Included in the Wii release of the title is a soundtrack CD. Notably, the box art makes note that "this Audio Compact Disc cannot be played on the Wii console".Super Mario Bros.

This glitch also only works on Super Mario Bros. 3 and only on the All-Stars releases of this game. By pressing both Left and Right, Mario (or Luigi) will move very, very quickly to the right - much faster than is normally possible, even when your P-Meter is maxed. This makes it much easier to get to the goal in a small amount of time (thus meaning more points) and also makes some gaps, previously uncrossable, now crossable.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] (SMB 3) Hidden White Mushroom Houses[CR]In certain levels, the screen moves forward and pushes you along. If you get a certain number of coins within these said levels, you unlock a secret white mushroom house holding a powerful item.

Blast him with fireballs, but don't grab the axe just yet. Instead, wait the timer out, but make sure you're next to the axe when there's about 50 seconds left. Now get ready and time your jump on the axe so the Timer reads '000'. Once you reach Toad and the game adds the Timer to your score, you may notice that it changed from '000' to '999'. Thus the game thinks you finished with '1000' on the Timer and times that by 5.   Note: this does not work on the Original NES version of the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To get the N-Spade card game to appear on the World Map.

You should get a chest with a Warp Whistle.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To warp to Worlds 2, 3,or 4 during World 1-2, go to the end where the 2 platforms are rising, get on the first platform, and use it to jump onto the highest structure in the middle, then jump on the next rising platform, but this time, when it reaches the top, jump onto the TOP of the level. Walk foward and drop down the small jump, and you can now warp to Worlds 2, 3, or 4 by going down the desired tube, and pressing down.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To warp to World 6,7 or 8 during World 4-2, go to the place where three blocks are can be seen (where a pipe can also be seen). Jump below the third block where you can reveal a secret block but be careful on jumping below the 1st block because you can't break it thus going to the secret warp world unless you are a small Mario. Then step on to it and break the 2nd and the 3rd block. After you have done this, go down, then jump again below the second block now (it should have been broken now). The position of the two revealed blocks must be a stair from right to left. Anyway, step on to the 2nd block then braek the 1st block and there you can see the vine going up. Climb until you reach the day light again. Get some coins if you wish and you can now see three pipes like in the secret warp Worlds 2,3 and 4. Go down your desired pipe.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]At the very end place of world 4-2 (where you can see the pipe going to the flag) jump on the long pipe and break the brick above it and go through the end and you can see the pipe going to the World 5.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]In Super Mario Brothers: Lost Levels, if you complete the game without warping, (Going through worlds 1-8, AND world 9), then you will move on to 4 secret special worlds. Worlds A, B, C, and D.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To access this warp, you must be Super or Fiery Mario. Go to the pipe at the end of the level and jump on top of it. Jump up and break the block over top of the part of the pipe farthest left. Then, position Mario on the edge of the pipe, with one foot hanging off the edge. Duck, then jump backwards as far right as possible.  If done just right, Mario will slide through the pipe and the bricks. Walk over to the warp zone area and enter the middle pipe. This pipe will take you to world 5, level 1. The same area can be acessed from a pipe in the same place in 4-2. However, this is meant to be a warp zone to 5-1, whereas the 1-2 warp to 5-1 is a glitch. After completing the jump trick in level 1-2, you can also go down either of the other two pipes, both of which will take you to Minus World -1. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]This only works with mushrooms and fire flowers. Reveal a power up from under any block which contains one. Now jump onto the power up and release the A button. As Mario is transitioning to the next power up, hold down the A button, and Mario will jump in mid-air![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Go to either 1-4, 2-4,3-4, etc. and get to Bowser. Make sure you are Big Mario and try to jump over Bowser or run under him. Stand near the Axe and Bowser will start to walk towards you. As he gets near you, jump high, and touch Bowser and the Axe at the same time. If you do it correctly, you will hear the sound as if you were to shrink, but you will just flash and stay big.  Go to the next stage, and get a Mushroom. (Yes, there will be a Mushroom instead of a Fire Flower.) When you touch the Mushroom, you will shrink. Then get a Fire Flower, and you'll have Fire Power as small Mario. (Note: after you do the Bowser/Axe trick, enemies that touch you will be able to kill you when you are Big Mario. When they touch you while you are small Mario after getting the Mushroom or Fire Flower, you will turn back into Big Mario.) [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]This glitch only works in the castle levels where you fight Bowser at the end - for example, World 1-4, 2-4, 3-4, and so on. It is best to defeat Bowser with Fire Mario or Fire Luigi beforehand, as you must wait out most of the timer to execute this glitch. At the end of the castle levels, there is an axe which you must touch to end the level. If you time your jump correctly (a full jump as the timer goes from 002 to 001 often works) and land on the axe while the timer reads "000", you'll continue as normal to the usual sequence at the end of the castle. However, your timer bonus (50 points per second remaining) will be calculated as if you had 999 seconds, not zero, left on the clock. This allows for an easy 49,950 point boost! Note that this glitch, if executed on levels using a flagpole, will prevent you from earning the bonus in that level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Get to world 3-1, and become Super Mario. At the end of the level, by the staircase before the end flag, you will see two turtles coming down the stairs. Jumping over the first one and then jumping on the second one should cause it to hit the star and bounce back. From here, jump on it and keep yourself off the ground for unlimited 1-ups.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]After beating the game, if you do not turn off the console, you will return to the title screen. There, you can press the B Button to start as desired in World 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]If you just walk along the sea floor, Bloopers will never be able to kill you because they are forced back up just before they hit the floor(or you).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]If you run out of lives and want to continue then at the game over screen press and hold A then press start at 1 player (or 2 player) and you will start at the beginning of the world at which you died![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To warp to Worlds 2, 3,or 4 during World 1-2, go to the end where the 2 platforms are rising, get on the first platform, and use it to jump onto the highest structure in the middle, then jump on the next rising platform, but this time, when it reaches the top, jump onto the TOP of the level. Walk foward and drop down the small jump, and you can now warp to Worlds 2, 3, or 4 by going down the desired tube, and pressing down.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To warp to World 6,7 or 8 during World 4-2, go to the place where three blocks are can be seen (where a pipe can also be seen). Jump below the third block where you can reveal a secret block but be careful on jumping below the 1st block because you can't break it thus going to the secret warp world unless you are a small Mario. Then step on to it and break the 2nd and the 3rd block. After you have done this, go down, then jump again below the second block now (it should have been broken now). The position of the two revealed blocks must be a stair from right to left. Anyway, step on to the 2nd block then braek the 1st block and there you can see the vine going up. Climb until you reach the day light again. Get some coins if you wish and you can now see three pipes like in the secret warp Worlds 2,3 and 4. Go down your desired pipe. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]This is a pretty commonly known secret. If you touch the flagpole of any level with either 1, 3, or 6 seconds left on the ones place of the timer, you will get that amount of fireworks. For example, if you touch the flagpole with 126 seconds left on the time, you will get six fireworks! [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Well this secret is so easy. At the very end place of world 4-2 (where you can see the pipe going to the flag) jump on the long pipe and break the brick above it and go through the end and you can see the pipe going to the World 5.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]While playing, pause the game, hold Up, B &amp; A on controller 2 and unpause.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Method 1:[CR]Use any character and run right toward an enemy at full speed. Just a split second before you think you're about to get hit, jump! With good timing you'll be able to jump yet again in midair! [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Method 2:[CR]This is yet another way to jump in midair. Stand on the ground while you have 3 or 4 life units and let an enemy run right into you. You'll lose a life unit, but you'll be able to jump in mid-air.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]This is most easily performed in World 1-1. Grab a POW block, and carry it to the set of logs. Wait for a log to bog over the waterfall, then throw the POW block so that it hits solid ground. For some odd reason, this will cause the log to fly high into the air. Strange, eh?[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Go to world 1-3 and find a potion. Now find the vase next to the brick building all the way to the right side of the level. Drop the potion and go into Sub-Space and then warp into the vase (stand on top of it and press down) You will warp to World 4![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Go to world 3-1 and go through the door to the large waterfall with all the clouds. Now jump down and land on the platform in the center and enter. Take the potion and drop it near the vase. Enter Sub-space and warp through the vase (press down on the vase) You will warp to World 5![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Go to world 4-2 and get the potion. Now find the vase and put the sub-space door next to it (drop it from atop the vase) Now enter sub-space and warp. You now warped to World 6[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Go to world 5-3 and get the potion (make sure you can squat-jump to the vase, you need to get someone with a good jumping ability or use an enemy to give you a boost.) [CR]Put the sub space door near the vase and enter sub space and warp into the vase. You are now in world 7![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]When fighting Bowser in the final level of the game, his lower half will not do damage to you. That means you can avoid damage from his ground-pound attack by ducking if you have obtained a power-up at some point, or, if Small Mario, you can walk under him and through him without sustaining damage![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In the game, you need to wait until the N-Spade card game - which appears with every 80,000 points you earn - spawns and moves to the spot of a fortress on the overworld map. If you go there now and play it, the fortress will as if you had beaten it afterwards, being collapsed and unplayable. Note, however, that the bridges and locks affected by defeating the fortress normally will still not unlock or reappear, so only do this when these things are not required.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In World 3-4, about halfway through the level, you'll slide down a long hill to get on another long hill which has some Koopas on it. Take one of their shells further to the right. As the Lakitu appears above, return back to the left. There are two ? Blocks, with a pipe and some bricks between them and wood blocks on the ground. Let the Koopa shell begin bouncing between the wooden blocks and on-screen. The Lakitu's Spinies will almost always launch or crawl down to be killed by the shell; the shell will subsequently rack up more points and lives as time goes on and more Spinies are added.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]When you come across a Kuribo's Shoe, make sure that you have a Tanooki Suit equipped. Just before you jump into the Shoe, transform into a statue. Mario will turn gray and enemies will be unable to touch him.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In this game, when you normally jump on enemies in sequence without touching the ground, the points you earn will increase from 100, to 200, to 400, to 800, to 1,000, netting a 1-Up on the sixth sequential jump and all those after. However, if your fifth (the one after 800 points) jump lands on either a Lakitu or Boomerang Bro., you'll begin getting 1-Ups right then! This glitch was fixed in Super Mario All-Stars.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]At the start of World 7-1, there is a doorway you're meant to go through. Instead of doing that, run at it and jump at its top-right corner. If done with ample acceleration (and sometimes crouching just before jumping - that can help) you can glitch into the wall and skip the majority of the level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Whenever you find a white block (such as the one in 1-3 that leads to the Whistle), stand on it and hold Down until you go through it. Then enter a pipe. In most cases, once on the other side, you'll be unable to be hurt by enemies for the remainder of the level (although sometimes also invisible).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In World 3's first fortress (just after 3-3), there are several doors you're meant to go through in the level, guessing which is the correct one. If you enter a door and it's wrong, you can immediately press Up before falling to go back through the door. Further, doing this on the third and fourth doors will warp you, instead of to the gray pipe like the other doors, straight to the boss room.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Complete the game and watch the ending. Now start a new game. You got 28 P-Wings! [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Note, however, that this will not work on the Japanese versions of the game, where you simply stay at the ending screen until you turn off the console.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In Bowsers castle at the end of the game, it is possible to make it so he DOES NOT SPIT FIRE AT YOU.  This trick is easy and only requires getting to world 8 with a P-wing.  First off, use your P-wing on the map before entering the Final Castle.  YOU MUST GET TO BOWSER INTACT.  If you get to the Bowser fight room and the Bricks that he smashes through are not flush with the rest of the floor, then you are in the wrong room.  Now, when you reach Bowsers room, FLY straight up and to the left.  You will be able to walk on a wall above the screen.  Drop down on the other side. You will be in another room to Fight Bowser in.  When you drop, you will be on a door that opens to the princess.  Ignore this room and DO NOT GO TOO FAR TO THE LEFT.  If you do, you will have to fight Bowser and he will still have his Fire Balls. Fly back over the wall to the first room you were in and start the Bowser fight.  He will still throw his head back and make the sound of spitting fire, but nothing will come out.   ;)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Get to World 1-2 as Raccoon Mario, with the tail. Climb the hill at the beginning and jump over the horizontal pipe. Stand there for a bit and a whole bunch of Goombas will start walking out of the pipe. Wait for 2-3 of them to come out of the pipe, then jump ontop of one and HOLD A to fly high into the air. Now that you are in the air, use your tail to slowly glide down from the air. On you landing, be sure to land on a second Goomba. Repeat this process for as long as you can. Eventually, the points you get for hitting each Goomba will turn into extra lives. This can be done for as long as you desire to do so. [CR]This can also be done in 2-Fortress, and 7-5, but it is most notably done in 1-2. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To ''hide'' behind scenery, simply hold down for a couple seconds while standing on a white block. Then your player can ''hide'' behind scenery for about thirty seconds.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To turn a wandering hammer brother (the ones that walk about on the world map) into a white ship full of coins, collect a number of coins that is a multiple of 11.  Make the tens digit in your score match the multiple of 11.  Stop the timer at the end of the stage that you are playing in on an even number.  [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]One combination would be:  11 coins, 9,310 as your score, and the timer at 104.  This only works in worlds 1, 3, 5, and 6.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Get through an airship and defeat the boss as a frog, Hammer Mario, or Tannooki, and you'll receive a letter from the King that reads a little differently.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To get the N-Spade card game to appear on the World Map. You must do gain 80,000 points as one player, and successfully beat the stage that you broke the 80,000 points with. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]You could just use the warp whistle at level 7... [CR]If you want to go straight to level 8, you must use a Warp Whistle to proceed to the Warp Zone, then use another warp whistle IN THE WARP ZONE. You will be transported to the level 8 pipe at the bottom of the screen.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]These secret items will allow you to warp. Here are their locations. [CR][B]Level 1-3[/B] [CR]Find the white block near the end and crouch on to of it for 5 seconds. Then proceed to the goal, and go behind it. You will find a Mushroom house with a Whistle. [CR][B]Level 1 Fortress[/B] [CR]Fly over the top of the level when you find the first door with your raccoon powers, and find a hidden door at the far right on the ceiling. It leads to a warp whistle [CR][B]Level 2 Hammer Brother[/B] [CR]Get the Hammer from one of the Hammer Brothers here and use it to destroy the rock at the upper right corner of the Level 2 Map. Then engage the hammer brother on the other side. You should get a chest with a Warp Whistle.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]If you get enough coins in a certain course, you can get a White Mushroom House! [CR]A White Mushroom House in worlds 1,3,5,7 have P Wings [CR]A White Mushroom House in worlds 2,4,6 have Anchors [CR]Levels and required coins: [CR]1-4 (44 coins) [CR]2-2 (30 coins) [CR]3-8 (42? coins) [CR]4-2 (22 coins) [CR]5-5 (28 coins) [CR]6-7 (78 coins) [CR]7-2 (42? coins)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In 8-4, as you approach the end, you'll cross a pit of lava guarded by two Parakoopas before entering a pipe. This pipe leads to a flat area (except for a dip and a pipe). Past said dip and pipe, you'll find the first Bowser, a fake one that is nonetheless difficult to beat because you cannot instantly kill him with the axe like normal - you must either dodge him, or kill him with Fire Flower fireballs. If you cannot (or do not want to), approach the gap just after the pipe while dashing at full speed - do not jump over the gap. You will run into the wall by doing so. Hold Right on the D-Pad for a while until the first fake Bowser is on-screen (you do so because the camera will not scroll otherwise). When he is about one-third of the way across the screen, you can then just hold Down and you'll automatically scroll past him, still stuck in the wall, although the camera is not scrolling. Once past him, you are free to continue on - you are not required to defeat this Bowser.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In World 1-1, go right until you see a Red Koopa boxed in by some bricks. Hit the second brick on the bottom and obtain the Mushroom from it. Then break the third brick and either the leftmost or rightmost one, trapping the Red Koopa on a single brick. You can then stomp on it, and then on its shell like in the original Super Mario Bros.'s infinite-lives trick, infinitely bouncing it back on the wall before you can touch the ground.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]This glitch only works in the castle levels where you fight Bowser at the end - for example, World 1-4, 2-4, 3-4, and so on. It is best to defeat Bowser with Fire Mario or Fire Luigi beforehand, as you must wait out most of the timer to execute this glitch. At the end of the castle levels, there is an axe which you must touch to end the level. If you time your jump correctly (a full jump as the timer goes from 002 to 001 often works) and land on the axe while the timer reads "000", you'll continue as normal to the usual sequence at the end of the castle. However, your timer bonus (50 points per second remaining) will be calculated as if you had 999 seconds, not zero, left on the clock. This allows for an easy 49,950 point boost! Note that this glitch, if executed on levels using a flagpole, will prevent you from earning the bonus in that level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Before you touch the flag at the end of a level, make sure your coin total is a multiple of 11. (00,11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88 or 99). Touch the flag when the last digit of your remaining time is the same digit as your coin total and you'll receive a 1-Up.[CR](For example, 55 coins and 275 time left, or 11 coins and 081 time left) [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To warp back to World 1, you must be in World 3-1. Near the end of the stage, jump onto the spring and fly over the flagpole. When you land, run forwards, and you'll find the warp pipe that takes you back to World 1.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]When you're in World 1-2, jump onto the bricks at the top. Run forwards, and you'll go past the pipe to exit the stage. Keep running, and soon enough, you'll find the warp pipe that takes you to World 2.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To warp to world 3, you must be in World 1-2. When you reach an area where there is a pipe, a few bricks, and a Steel-Shelled Koopa, hit the first brick on the left. A beanstalk will pop out. Climb up the beanstalk, and at the top, run forwards until you reach the warp pipe that takes you to World 3.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To Warp to World 4 you must be in World 1-2.  When you get to the moving platforms jump onto the platform.  While on the platform get a running start then jump to the to the small brick ceiling then jump again to the next brick ceiling.  Keep going until you see 2 pipes.  Go down the pipe that's on the far left.  You will be led to a secret area with lava.  Make sure that Mario or Luigi is small.  Run under the small lava pit that's positioned under a brick wall.  After you make it under the lava pit keep going until you see a pipe.  Don't go down the pipe.  Instead, search for a secret coin block that's located one space to the left of the lava pit.  Then get on the coin block and look for a coin block that's  located one space to the right of the coin block that you are on.  Jump on next coin block and jump up to brick wall ceiling.  You should find a Warp Zone that leads to World 4. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To Warp to World 5 you must be in World 8-1.  After you pass the 3rd Hammer Bro go down the next pipe you see that points upwards.  You will be led to a secret water area.  Collect the coins and exit.  When you exit you will end up outside.  Go up the stairs and you will see a pipe that leads you back to World 5.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]You must be at least Super Mario to do this. Near the end of World 5-1, when you see two rows of floating bricks past two Red Paratroopas, hit the rightmost brick of the top row to release a vine. Smash the brick next to it, and then climb the vine. After going through the small bonus area, you will be dropped off on a pipe right next to a Warp Zone that takes you to World Six.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Near the end of world 5-2, when you encounter the trio of tiny elevators, try to go as high as you can, so you can jump off the last elevator and reach the top of the ceiling. Continue to run right, making sure to jump when the ceiling ends, and you will eventually reach the Warp Zone for World 7.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In World A-2, about halfway through the underground part of the level, you'll find a set of staircase-like blocks. You can break through the blocks above them and get on the upper portion of the area. From there, you can run and jump heading right and past the warp pipe heading outside - this takes you to a World B warp zone.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]When you are in World A-3, use the spring to get over the flagpole at the end of the stage. From there, run forwards until you reach a pipe. It takes you to World C.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In World B-4, go to the very last pipe in the level (it's next to a lava pit). Jump in the pipe and you will be taken to a Warp Zone area that will lead to World D.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In world 5-2, when you reach the three elevators, hop on the first one and use it to hit the brick immediately left of the elevator. Climb the vine that sprouts from the brick and travel through the small bonus area to reach the Warp Zone that'll take you to World 8.</plot>

<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Mario Kart is a racing video game, developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo for the SNES. It was the first game of the Mario Kart franchise. It was launched in Japan on August 27 1992, in North America on September 1 1992 and in Europe on January 21 1993. It was also released for the Virtual Console in Japan on June 9 2009, North America on November 23 2009, and in Europe on April 2 2010.[CR]In Super Mario Kart the player chooses one of eight characters from the Mario franchise. Each has different capabilities unique to them. During races players can pick up power ups to help them win the race.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Super Mario Kart the player is tasked to take control of one of the characters and finish before anyone else. The racers race in a go-kart. The player's viewpoint during the race is behind his/her's go-kart.Game ModesThe very first race is about to begin. And... GO![CR]Super Mario Kart is split into two singleplayer modes (Mario Kart GP and Time Trial) and three multiplayer modes (Mario Kart GP, Match Race and Battle Mode). In Mario Kart GP one player playes against seven CPU controlled characters in three cups of five races. At first there three cups that can be played on two difficulties (50cc and 100cc). By finishing first in all three cups on 100cc difficulty, a new cup is unlocked, the Special Cup. By winning the fourth cup on 100cc difficulty, the 150cc difficulty level is unlocked. In time trial mode the players race alone, with the goal of beating the other players time.[CR]In multiplayer, Mario Kart GP is the same as in singleplayer, except now there are 6 CPUs and 2 player controlled characters. In Match Race, two players compete against each other without any CPU players on any track in the game. In Battle Mode two players still go head to head against each other without CPUs on the track, but this time on special tracks created specifically for this mode. Each player starts with three balloons which are to be destroyed by the other player. The first player to have all of his balloons destroyed losses the battle.DriversMarioLuigiPrincessYoshiBowserDonkey Kong Jr.Koopa TroopaToadItemsGreen Shell, which can either be fired in a straight line forward or dropped into a stationary position.Red Shell, which acts as a homing missile and will attack the driver in front.Banana Peel, similar to the green shell, with the exception that its forward shot is fired in an arc.Feather, which allows the user to jump once - useful for getting over obstacles or finding shortcuts.Mushroom, which gives the user a temporary speed boost.Star, which makes the user invincible to everything, and also causes others to spin out on contact.Lightning Bolt, which shrinks all other drivers and causes them to drive slower.Coin, which adds a few coins when used. 100 coins will NOT award an extra life.Ghost, which can steal one item from another driver.Shrinking Mushroom, which will cause the shrunken effect to anyone who touches it (only usable by CPU controlled Princess and Toad)Fireball, a stationary weapon that spins around in a small circle (only usable by CPU controlled Bowser)Egg, similar to a banana.

This will not effect speed whatsoever, it will only make it so your opponents can run you over to slow you down. Hold Y and push A to make yourself big again.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Small Racer[CR]Go to Time Trial or 2P Match Race, put the cursor on Mushroom Cup and press: L,R,L,R,L,L,R,R,A. If you haven't unlocked Special Cup already, it'll be available now.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue playing after you lose (Battle Mode)[CR]When you're on your last balloon, hop over a banana peel. After the music changes and the screen darkens, you can still drive your kart around. You can even pick up items, use them, and the Star music will play if you obtain it.This glitch stops working if you stop your kart.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue playing after you lose (Battle Mode)[CR]When playing Battle Mode with another player, obtain a Feather. Once earned, you use it to jump to the out-of-bounds area on the course. If you jump far enough, your character will be dragged back to the course but, for unknown reasons, remain invisible on your opponent's screen (and sometimes yours), with only the balloons visible, making it much harder for them to find you.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue playing after you lose (Battle Mode)[CR]When you get a Mushroom item, approach a wall on the track, preferably a corner wall that juts into the track. As you approach it, release B to decelerate and then press A to use the Mushroom and use L/R to hop "into" the wall. Once the wall is bumped, only hold L/R to keep the boost. The boost will keep going forever so long as you don't bump into anything else on the course.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue playing after you lose (Battle Mode)[CR]You'll need to obtain a Feather item for this. Once obtained, go ahead of the starting line and make a U-turn. Once in line with the starting line, back up to the side of the track and somewhat ahead of the starting line. Drive and leap forward over the lava at the edge of the track, onto the stony area beyond it, thanks to the Feather; be sure to land behind the starting line as well. You'll be dragged back to the track by Lakitu, and mistakenly labeled as being one lap ahead.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue playing after you lose (Battle Mode)[CR]On this track, when the lap begins, drive forward from the starting line and make a U-turn some point thereafter. Drive back to the starting line and, as you approach it, hop off of the left side (from your view - right on the track map) of the track and fall and "die" behind the finish line. When Lakitu grabs you back up, he'll drag you forward and past the finish line, and mistakenly glitch the game into thinking that you've just done a whole lap. You can only do this every other lap at the most, though, so only on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th laps in succession, or on the 2nd and 4th in succession.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue playing after you lose (Battle Mode)[CR]This trick only works on courses which have walls of blocks to the right or left of the starting line (whichever side is towards the center of the track). When a race begins, drive to the right of the finish line and begin ramming it with your kart, about in line with the actual starting/finish line. You'll suddenly begin to warp ahead laps, albeit somewhat randomly depending on where you hit the wall. It is best to hop a lot whilst bumping the wall, and aim for the center of the colored segment that is in line with the wall.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue playing after you lose (Battle Mode)[CR]When you get a Feather item, drive through the course as normal. As you near the finish line, make a hard drift to the left so that you're almost off the left side of the course and nearly perpendicular to the course when you finish the lap. Use the Feather at this point and you should hop in the air and back behind the finish line before you "die". Lakitu will drag you back on to the course and you'll get the extra lap counted.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue playing after you lose (Battle Mode)[CR]You'll need a Feather item for this. Once obtained, drive around the course as normal. As you pass the starting line, begin a hard drift to the left or right (whichever is towards the out-of-bounds area of the course's outer edge). As you approach the wall bounding the course, use the Feather. If your drifting is tight enough, you'll leap up, over the wall to the out-of bounds area, and back in without actually needing to be dragged back to the course. (Sometimes, even if you are dragged back, this glitch will still work.) You can then cross the finish line again to get the extra lap counted.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Camera Pan[CR]Choose any character and go to any time trial and finish it without making any mistakes.  Now, when you watch the little replay clip of your race, press L or R to make the camera swing around your character.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Camera Pan[CR]If you finish three races in the same place, you'll earn an extra continue.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Camera Pan[CR]When you have a ghost that you'd like to save in Time Trials, hold L, R, and Y at the menu screen that displays after you've completed a Time Trial race and press X. The name of the course on which the ghost was saved will be highlighted in yellow on the Course Select menu. To race against the ghost you saved, choose the course(the one highlighted in yellow) and hold L or R while pressing B when the screen asks ''Is this OK?'' and the arrow is pointing to ''Yes''.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Camera Pan[CR]Select 1P Time Trials and then on the select driver screen, press START on 2nd controller. It will bring up a driver select for COM. Select who you want it to be. You can now race a ghost driver anytime.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Camera Pan[CR]This speed boost can occur at the beginning of a race. When the three lights begin to count down, if you press the Acceleration button just before the second light lights up, and you hold it until the race starts, you get a boost of speed. If this speed boost is timed and positioned right, it can easily put you in first place right from the start.[CR]</plot>

<plot>Mario returns in this incredible new role-playing adventure! His latest rival is Smithy, a menacing creature who causes fear and treachery in the Mushroom Kingdom. Mario must recover seven stars and repair the Star Road before he can make his way to Bowser's castle for a final confrontation with Smithy. Powerful weapons, sinister spells and other useful items help Mario to complete his harrowing journey. New friends and old allies support him along the way. Even Bowser lends a hand![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hidden command[CR]Notice: this only works in the SFC/Japanese version.[CR]Open the menu screen (by pressing X), then press Down, Up, Right, Left, Select, Start, Select, Start, B. Kinopio (Toad) pops up and asks to see your status, giving you little tips and tricks.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Spell transfer glitch[CR]Any spell that is learned by leveling up can be transferred to a different character.  But the level up has to occur using an invincibility star.  When you jump to open the chest with the star, press the menu button to open the menu mid jump.  In the menu switch the character you want to learn the spell with the character that is going to level up.  Kill enemies until that character levels up.  After the invincibility wears off and the level up process finishes the the spell they learned during the level up will be given to the character that you moved into their previous position.The glitch occurs because the game is confused and thinks the character that leveled up is still in the old party slot, so it adds the spell to the magic list of the character currently in that slot.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 2D Mario from Super Mario Bros. 1[CR]One time only in the game you can change into a 2D Mario walking around on a 3D landscape. It is prety cool. The image turns sideways when you tern diagonal. In booster tower, I think it's right after the room with a switch that opens a pasage of booster pass. There is a large curtain near the exit. Go in the right side and coming out the right side wont do it but going in the right and coming out the left causes the transformation.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 2D Mario from Super Mario Bros. 1[CR]In the uppermost right corner, you can see F-Zero and Star Fox racers in Hinopio's shop on Barrel Volcano.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 2D Mario from Super Mario Bros. 1[CR]These two popular characters play no significant role in the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 2D Mario from Super Mario Bros. 1[CR]To find Link, return to the Rosa Inn (same place where you played with that Gaz girl) after you find the 2nd star. He'll be upstairs sleeping in the bed. Try to talk to him and the Zelda Mystery noise plays.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 2D Mario from Super Mario Bros. 1[CR]To find Samus, go to the Mushroom Kingdom after securing the 5th star. Go into the castle, then  to the guest room. Samus will be sleeping in the bed. If you talk to her, she says she's resting for Mother brain.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 2D Mario from Super Mario Bros. 1[CR]In Toadstool's room examine the right side of the fireplace to find "Toadstool's ???" and get an amusing comment from the maid along with a free Mushroom.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 2D Mario from Super Mario Bros. 1[CR]When you reach Booster Tower and get to the top where you talk to *some-what spoiler character* through the door. After this conversation look in the box where Booster and his Snifits are talking. There is a samus action figure.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Level Ups[CR]Look for a place where a star is next to a save point. Save, then get the star, level up as many times as you can. Then die (in game) and you will still have your levels, aswell as be able to use the star again :-).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Level Ups[CR]Easy Level up[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Level Ups[CR]After you acquire Geno, put him in your party. After he learn the move Geno Whirl, enter battle. Use Geno Whirl and a tornado like wind will come onto the screen. Push [B] Y [/B] right before it leaves the screen for 9999 attack points. [CR]Note: You will hear a crackling sound if you did it right. This does not work on all enemies (ie bosses).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Level Ups[CR]When you are on the path going towards Rosa town, get to the section where all of the ShyGuys are standing on top of the treasure boxes. Go to the bottom right side of the screen to the exit. Hit the box next to the door and get a few coins (but do not empty it, leave some in) then go through the exit. As soon as you go through the exit, go back through and hit the box more times (still don't empty it). Then just repeat this until you have a many coins as you want, it won't go empty![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Level Ups[CR]Many who search for all of the Hidden Treasure Boxes are stumped by the one in the Mushroom Kingdom Castle.[CR]Ordinarily, you can find any hidden Treasure box at multiple points in the game. The one in Mushroom castle, however, has only 1 oppurtunity, and that is at the beginning of the game. On your first visit to the castle, be sure to jump on Toad's head and ride him to where the door is. You can now jump onto the ledge right above the door and find a Treasure box that can't be found at any other point in the game.</plot>

<rom name="plugin://plugin.program.iarl/Emulator/SNES_ZachMorris/Game/Super+Mario+World+%28USA%29" size="345695"/>
<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Mario World (known in Japan as Super Mario World: Super Mario Bros. 4) is a side-scrolling platformer developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on November 21, 1990 (in Japan), August 31, 1991 (in North America), and April 11, 1992 (in Europe).One of the launch titles of the SNES (and bundled with early systems in North America), Super Mario World is the fifth main game in the Super Mario series. (starring Nintendo's mascot, Mario, and his brother, Luigi). The game follows both Mario brothers as they explore Dinosaur Land (known for its large amount of dinosaurs) to find and defeat the evil Koopa king Bowser (and his seven underlings, the Koopalings) while rescuing Princess Toadstool.Along with new abilities (such as the "Spin Jump"), a new power-up (the "Cape Feather") and more obstacles, the game introduces dinosaur companions (known as Yoshi) that Mario and Luigi can ride. Yoshi, known for using their long tongues to snare and eat enemies, have become a fan-favorite among the series (giving them their own games and spin-offs, most notably this game's prequel).Special bundles of the SNES in 1994 included a compilation cartridge mixing Super Mario World with Super Mario All-Stars. The only difference in this version is a new sprite set for Luigi. The original game was later ported to the Game Boy Advance on February 11, 2002 as Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2. Along with a special version of the original Mario Bros., the port includes a variety of differences, including Luigi as a selectable character (who now has unique features, such as his floating jump from Super Mario Bros. 2), new voice acting, and the ability to save anywhere. The original game was also digitally re-released in Nintendo's Virtual Console platform for the Wii (on February 5, 2007) and Wii U (on April 26, 2013).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Super Mario World plays like a standard sidescrolling platformer (similar to the previous Super Mario Bros. games), where players must guide Mario or Luigi through over 75 stages, split into over seven unique areas (or "Worlds"). Each stage has a goal to reach, usually a giant moving goalpost (known as Giant Gates) at the rightmost part of the level (rarely a special mysterious exit reachable by a keyhole, requiring Mario/Luigi to carry a large key).YoshiYoshi's first appearanceMario can ride Yoshi in all stages of the game except for castles and fortresses, and can make Yoshi shoot out his long tongue to snare and eat enemies.Power-UpsThroughout each level (usually in special Blocks), Mario and Luigi can find power-ups to give themselves special abilities:Super Mushroom - Transforms into Super Mario/Luigi, giving them a taller stature while allowing them to get hit once without losing a life. They can also break some Blocks by hitting it from below and Spin Jump on Rotating Blocks to break them. This power-up glides across the ground before collected and can sometimes be found by running over special areas (like some bushes). All Yellow Exclamation Blocks contain this power-up. Running over checkpoint gates as regular Mario/Luigi automatically puts them in Super form.Fire Flower - Transforms into Fire Mario/Luigi. In addition to the benefits of the Super Mushroom, they can now throw fireballs (which can damage and destroy most enemies) by tapping the X or Y buttons. Performing a Spin Jump also throws fireballs on both sides of them. This power-up is usually stationary before collected. In the GBA remake, getting hit while in Fire form changes them into Super form (similar to Super Mario Bros. 3).Cape Feather - Transforms into Cape Mario/Luigi. In addition to the benefits of the Super Mushroom, they can now glide across the air by holding the X or Y buttons. In addition, making a running jump allows them to fly through the air (allowing them to sail with the cape by holding Up and Down on the joypad). This power-up floats left and right downward before collected. All Green Exclamation Blocks contain this power-up. Jumping on Super Koopas cause them to drop a Cape Feather.Somewhat similar to Super Mario Bros. 3, players can have the ability to store spare power-ups for use at a later time. If a player collects two of the same power-up (or if they collect a Super Mushroom while in Fire or Cape forms), it will be placed in the Reserve Box at the top of the HUD. Getting hit (or pressing the Select button in-game) causes the item to slowly descend from the Reserve Box. Also new to the game are Roulette Blocks, which can carry either of these power-ups (along with the Starman power-up below) and is chosen when the player hits the block.In addition, Mario and Luigi can find two rare power-ups that do not permanently transform them, instead temporarily giving them a special ability:Starman - Grants them temporary invincibility, allowing them to bump onto any enemies to defeat them. Unlike previous games, players can chain combos by bumping onto enemies in quick succession (giving them easier extra lives). Usually found in Roulette Blocks.Power Balloon - Temporarily inflates them allowing them to hover in the air and gradually float upwards. Found in only four levels and is not necessary for normal game progression (only required for reaching secret exits). [CR][B]Worlds:[/B][CR]Dinosaur Land.There are over 75 levels in the game, each split into multiple areas (or "Worlds"). These worlds (along with the Koopaling boss in that world):Yoshi's Island (Iggy)Donut Plains (Morton)Vanilla Dome (Lemmy)Cheese Bridge (Ludwig)Forest of Illusion (Roy)Chocolate Island (Wendy)Valley of Bowser (Larry)While each world can be progressed in a narrow path, the game features an abundance of secret exits and alternate paths leading to hidden levels, bonus areas, and special shortcuts. Some of the more notable secret levels include the four Switch Palaces (allowing players to unlock special Exclamation Blocks for use as platforms and a way to earn power-ups), the Butter Bridge path (an alternate way to traverse both the 3rd and 4th Worlds), the Valley Fortress (a way to skip most of 7th World and end up at the back door of Bowser's Castle), and the Top Secret Area (a hidden one-screen level in Donut Plains that gives players free power-ups and a Yoshi).Bonus WorldsIn addition, there are two secret areas only accessible through special Star Roads hidden throughout the game: Star World and Special Zone.The Star World (up in the clouds) acts as a special "fast travel" area between most of Dinosaur Land (from the Donut Plains to the Valley of Bowser). There are five Star Roads that lead to it, each with their own accompanying level. Reaching the secret Keyhole exit in each level opens up a path between the level and another Star Road (eventually making a circular path). All levels in this area also have a hidden red, blue, or yellow-colored baby Yoshi (allowing players to gain Yoshis with special abilities).By completing both normal and Keyhole exits allows a new Star Road entrance to the Special Zone: eight challenging levels that must be completed sequentially (each with a level name resembling '80s slang for something positive). Completing all eight levels gives them a one-way Star Road back to Yoshi's House while changing the color scheme of the overworld (giving it a Fall apperance) and giving some enemies a Fall theme (Koopa Troopas wearing Mario masks, both jumping Piranha Plants and Beanstalks becoming haunted pumpkins, and Bullet Bills resembling crow-like Pidgits).While four of the Star Roads have no exit routes in Dinosaur Land (unless previously unlocked), the fifth Star Road immediately links to the front door of Bowser's Castle, allowing players to skip a large majority of the game.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Amazing Flying Hammer BroA flying enemy, throws hammers.

Hold the buttons until the credits show up. A very strange Easter egg I must say.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Berry Freeze[CR]Enter a level with [B]Yoshi[/B], [B]Cape Mario[/B], and a [B]Fire Flower[/B] in reserve. Position yourself under a berry in a way that you can get the fire flower [I]and[/I] get the berry at the same time. If you happen to eat the flower and the berry at the same time, the game will freeze. Several things have been reported while using this glitch. Sometimes when the game freezes, your coin count will rise until you quickly have 99 lives. Press Start and Select to exit the leve. One person's game froze, horizontal lines appeared on the screen, and weird music kept looping over and over again. Then came a buzzing noise, and he was returned to the file select screen, with his file deleted. Thankfully, that's not normal. Even so, this is an interesting glitch to exploit every once in a while.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Berry Freeze[CR]For this glitch, you'll need to get Fire Mario and Yoshi in Yoshi's Island 2. Near the end of the level, there is a Piranha Plant in a pipe near a Dragon Coin. Stand on said pipe, about 2/3 of the way across. Pay attention to the Rexor to the right. When he is walking left and about 3/4 past the Dragon Coin, crouch, then press X+A simultaneously. Mario will jump off of Yoshi as Yoshi attempts to eat him, and you'll get some weird glitchy item in your item storage. (If you did it wrong, the game just crashes horrifically.) If you summon this item during a level, and then grab it, the level is then completed, provided that Mario does not die while attempting to walk off-screen. Note that the orb only works once, and you need to get it again to complete another level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Berry Freeze[CR]In Chocolate Island 5, play the level as normal. Past the midpoint in the level, you'll begin to see a bunch of Spinies trapped in unmoving blocks (which are removed by a silver P Switch). Get the nearby blue and silver P Switches and try to drop one on top of the other so that they completely overlap each other; when done properly, attempting to grab one will grab both. Nearby, also, are some yellow flip panels, with a blank spot in the center. Get in the center and run right as much as you can. Let go of the switches and, suddenly, ? Blocks will begin appearing, spewing a multitude of Yoshi Eggs. Once a Yoshi hatches, these eggs will spew 1-Ups instead.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Berry Freeze[CR]First all you need to do is find a switch ( the kind that changes the square outlines into brown blocks ). You also need to be on a yoshi. Normally when you hit the switch, it will flatten and disappear. When you jump on it, quicky turn around and eat it with your yoshi, if you do it fast enouph, you will have it in the yoshis mouth. You can spit it out and use it again.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Inverted World Map[CR]Complete The secret world. (With Stage names Such as Awsome  and Tubular.)[CR]And then Enter the second Star road that Appears after you Complete "Funky" And the world Map will Have A diffrent Color Pallete and some enemies will look different.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Extra Life[CR]Beat a stage with your time ending in the same digit repeated twice as the tens place of your Star total, and you'll be awarded an extra life. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Extra Life[CR]Example:[CR]With 17 stars, beat the stage with your time ending in 11.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Extra Life[CR]If you sit at one of the levels in Special World for about 2 minutes, you'll start to hear a Super Mario Brothers remix![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Extra Life[CR]Try holding an item (shell, trampoline, etc) and cross the Goal line. The item you're carrying will turn into a 1-Up mushroom.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Extra Life[CR]When you beat a castle you normally cannot enter it again.  [CR]Go to the castle you want to play again and Press L+R at the same time. </plot>

<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mario Bros. is the first in a long line of Mario Bros. titles, although its differences from the later games are significant.[CR]Comparison to other Mario Games[CR]Mario Bros. FirstsMario - initially called Jumpman - was introduced in Nintendo's first Donkey Kong video game. There, his only offensive ability was the hammer which, like Pac-Man's power pellets, were limited in number and duration. Here, Mario has an ongoing offensive power, one that he would use throughout the sequels, that of jumping under a thing that is standing on a ledge above. While this is usually an optional attack in the later games, for Mario Bros. it's vital for finishing a given stage. Punching underneath a monster flips it over or changes its color (in lieu of flipping it over). Only when upside down is a monster safe to touch. Should Mario touch a monster, he actually boots it into the water at the bottom of the screen, scoring points and defeating the enemy. Other firsts which would find their way into later Mario Bros. titles:This game was the first appearance of the iconic turtle enemy called the Shell Creeper, later dubbed the Koopa Troopa. Mario could not, however, jump on their backs as he could later, even though the Shell Creepers and Koopa Troopas look nearly identical.Shining sewer pipes, too, made their first appearance. This time they serve as monster dispensers, and reminders that game takes place in a sewer.Many things fall into the sewers, including baby turtles which grow up to be Shell Creepers, but another iconic thing that might get lost in a storm drain is a coin. Thus, coins are brought in as extra scoring items every time an enemy is killed. If Mario picks them up before they reach the bottom of the screen, the player gets extra points.The POW block, used to flip all the monsters over who are currently standing on a surface, is later employed in other Super Mario games (though its "zapper-like" abilities are changed).Fireballs also make an appearance, looking a bit more like the fireballs Mario and Luigi throw when they've picked up a flower in Super Mario Bros., but fireballs in this game are enemies.And last, but not least, the simultaneous two-player mode introduces Luigi, a swapped-palette Mario.Elements Unique to Mario Bros.Many elements in Mario Bros. did not get picked up for later installments of the Mario Bros. series. Other enemies, such as the hopping Fighter Flies, ice-patch creating Slipice blobs, and crabby Sidesteppers are seen nowhere else. Neither is the complex punching-under-then-hopping-up-to-kill-the-monster mechanic, although there are certain situations in later games where this is a viable tactic. Touching an enemy when it isn't supine brings instant death, and possibly the most notable difference is that the game is largely defensive. In Donkey Kong before it, and all Super Mario games after, Mario as a player character is largely the mover, moving the game from scene to scene. Here Mario and Luigi defend territory until they win - the scenery eventually changes, but only slightly.[CR]</plot>
