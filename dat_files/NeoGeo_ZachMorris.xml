			<emu_comment>Internet Archive Neo Geo game list is a filtered list from the Final Burn Alpha 0.2.97.42 Listing by Zach Morris.  This list includes all Neo Geo titles minus demos, etc.[CR]The NeoGeo is a cartridge-based arcade and home video game system released on July 1, 1991 by Japanese game company SNK. Being in the Fourth generation of Gaming, it was the first console in the former Neo Geo family, which only lived through the 1990s.[CR]The hardware featured comparatively colourful 2D graphics. The MVS (Multi Video System), as the Neo Geo was known to the coin-op industry, offered arcade operators the ability to put up to 6 different arcade titles into a single cabinet, a key economic consideration for operators with limited floorspace. With its games stored on self-contained cartridges, a game-cabinet could be exchanged for a different game-title by swapping the game's ROM-cartridge and cabinet artwork.[CR]Several popular franchise-series, including Fatal Fury, The King of Fighters, Metal Slug and Samurai Shodown, were released for the platform. The Neo Geo system was also marketed as a very costly home console, commonly referred to today as the AES (Advanced Entertainment System). The Neo Geo was marketed as 24-bit, though it was technically a parallel processing 16-bit system with an 8-bit Zilog Z80 as coprocessor. The coprocessor was used as a CPU, and for sound processing.[CR]Developer:  SNK[CR]Manufacturer:  SNK[CR]CPU:  Motorola 68000[CR]Memory:  64KB RAM, 74KB VRAM[CR]Graphics:  SNK LSPC2-A2[CR]Sound:  Yamaha YM2610[CR]Display:  320Ã—224[CR]Media:  Cartridge[CR]Max Controllers:  2</emu_comment>

			<title_clean>Aggressors of Dark Kombat / Tsuukai GANGAN Koushinkyoku</title_clean>
			<plot>&#30171;&#24555;GANGAN&#34892;&#36914;&#26354; (c) 1994 SNK Corp.[CR](Tsuukai Gangan Koushinkyoku)[CR]1-on-1 fighter featuring 8 selectable characters.[CR]The game's major innovation is the ability to walk into the background, in a similar manner to side-scrolling beat 'em ups such as "Streets of Rage" or "Final Fight" because of this, unlike many other 2-D fighting games, the game uses one action button to jump, it also does not use the 'D' button, (Which many of SNK's other fighters did), only 2 action buttons are used for attacking (punch and kick), instead grappling and grabbing opponents (Pressing the A &amp; B buttons simultaneously) is the focus of the gameplay, opponents can counter being grabbed, as well as break free. Also featured is weapon play, again similar to beat 'em ups, weapons can be picked up and thrown, or used in special &amp; standard attacks. Weapons are thrown in by background crowd members who will step forward to toss them into the ring. Another (strange) innovation of the game is that characters start to sweat -graphically- after a while.[CR]Characters have unusually high health for the genre, with multiple, different coloured, health bars in one bar similar to a method of health bars used for boss characters in games of the time, in addition to this, each character has a 'Crazy Meter' at the bottom of the screen, which is built up as characters attack, this gives the character a special, often very bizarre, attack that will kill the opponent outright, known as the GanGan Attack in Japan, and the Crazy Attack in the US.[CR]Battles are joined by irreverent, sometimes humorous pre-fight banter from characters, the dialog differs depending on whom each opponent is, and a clashing of 2 small images of the characters eyes, which clash in the center of the screen.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID: NGM-074[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player (3 usables).[CR]=&gt; [Joystick] 8-Way, [A] Punch [B] Kick [C] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Tsuukai Gangan Koushinkyoku was released in July 1994 in Japan.[CR]This game is known outside Japan as Aggressors of Dark Kombat. (A)ggressors of (D)ark (K)ombat = ADK. The title is also a kind of pun on "Mortal Kombat".[CR]The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Thrilling Intense March'. GANGAN is also Japanese onomatopoeia for the sound of a large bell or a scolding voice.[CR]Criticism: Aggressors of Dark Kombat is a somewhat unknown title compared to SNK's other fighting franchises such as "Fatal Fury", "Art of Fighting" and their signature fighting title "The King of Fighters" and was not found in great numbers in arcades, nor did it's home console version sell well, and it is generally considered by reviewers and fans of the genre of the time, to be a mediocre title. Now, Aggressors of Dark Kombat is considered a cult game, recommended for all those gamers who wants a different game of those mentioned before.[CR]The game features 8 selectable characters, these characters are not named anywhere in-game, unusual for the genre, which usually gives the character's name in the menu, and almost always places it at some point around the character's health bar. 7 of the characters are new and also appears Kotaro Fuuma from "World Heroes".[CR]* Joe Kusanagi - His nickname is 'Red Panther of Honmoku' and is the protagonist of this story. Joe is the most powerful and famous brawler of the Eastern zone of Japan (know as Kanto). Bored of doesn't find good opponents in his zone, he heard rumors about strong guys in the Western zone, so he travels there to confirm the rumor. Joe is the balanced character in the game, with many combo moves and various techniques. Apart of this game, he appears as a cameo in one of Kisarah's attacks in Neo Geo Battle Coliseum.[CR]* Kisarah Westfield - Her nickname is 'Naive Tomboy'. An English school girl who is known as a femme fatale in Japanese schools. But Kisarah falls in love with Joe Kusanagi and now chases him to obligate Joe to be her boyfriend. She is the only female in this game, the most famous character, and one of the most versatile characters from this game. Kisarah appears as a selectable character in "Neo Geo Battle Coliseum" and as a SNK character card in "SNK vs. Capcom - Card Fighters DS".[CR]* Goh Kidokoro - His nickname is 'Strong Spirit from Naniwa'. Goh is the most famous brawler in Western zone of Japan (known as Kansai) and he has his own gang. Goh got the news about the arrival of 'Red Panther from Honmoku' and now is waiting to fight against this new menace for his goal of nationwide conquest. Goh is the grappler from this game, with many powerful grabs and various powers.[CR]* Kotaro Fuuma - His nickname is 'Angry Hurricane'. His story in the game is simply that he got lost during one of his travels through time and landed in 1994 Japan, where the game takes place, becoming involved in the ensuing fights. Like the rest of characters in AODK, Fuuma doesn't have powers (only his EnRyuuHa signature move from WH series makes the transition with him), but in return, he gains many combo moves and a teleport.[CR]* Leonhalt Domador - His nickname is 'Black Bull'. A German brawler who escapes from his native country as a refugee. He comes to Japan to convert in the most strong fighter of all, no matter what for. Leonhalt is the tallest, slowest and the most powerful fighter from this game. Also he's the rival for Sheen Genus.[CR]* Sheen Genus - His nickname is 'Rising Tiger'. A Canadian amateur wrestler who wants with his group to make his own professional Wrestling Federation, and now is searching strong people to join to him. Sheen is the wrestler of the game and is the rival of Leonhalt Domador. Recently appears in "SNK vs. Capcom - Card Fighters DS" as an Action card.[CR]* Lee Hae Gwan - His nickname is 'White Fang'. A Chinese martial artist who lives in Japan and works for a school. Now he searches for revenge against the brawler who makes disasters in his school: Leonhalt Domador. Lee is one of the fastest characters in the game, who has a good arsenal of kicks and various martial tricks.[CR]* Bobby Nelson - His nickname is 'Brown Bullet'. An African-American boy who is a basketball player and wanted to be known and famous. To achieve his objective, Bobby is traveling the world, waiting to be discovered. Bobby is the fastest and smallest character in this game, and the only one who always have a weapon within (in this case, his basket ball). Recently appears in "SNK vs. Capcom - Card Fighters DS" as an Action card, along with Sean Matsuda from "Street Fighter III".[CR]The game features written lyrics at the credits roll for each character, either it was not feasible to get vocal works for these songs, or it could be an attempt to invite gamers to have fun with these by attempting some sort of karaoke. The latter option seems highly probable due to the popularity of karaoke in Japan.[CR]Soundtrack releases :[CR][JP] October 21, 1994, "Tsuukai Gangan Koushinkyoku [GSM 1500 Series] [PCCB-00163] - Pony Canyon / Scitron[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]There are almost no differences between the Japanese release of this game &amp; the International versions aside from the rather drastic name change, but it is worth taking notice that there is blood to be found when you use a critical hit on an opponent on the Japanese release only.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Some throws that either break bones or hit the opponent's crotch will stun opponents for quite a long time, allowing you to get an easy chance for a big combo.[CR]* Beat the game 2 times in a row to see all the characters in a super deformed style at the end of the credits.[CR]* Beat the game 2 times in a row and without using a continue to get a longer Karaoke sequence and a group shot of chubby versions of the characters.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Developed by ADK.[CR]Executive Producer : Kazuo Arai[CR]Producer, Action Plan, Game Director : Tsutomu Maruyama[CR]Director, Game Plan : Takashi Hatono[CR]Second director, Algolism Plan : Kenji Sawatari[CR]Marketing Researcher : Yukio Gotoh[CR]System Planner : Tsutomu Maruyama[CR]System Programmers : Eiji Fukatsu, Makio Chiba[CR]Programmers : Hideo Kamoda, Teruaki Shirasawa, M.

			<plot>&#40845;&#34382;&#12398;&#25331; (c) 1992 SNK Corp.[CR](Ryuuko no Ken)[CR]An early Neo-Geo martial arts fighting game with 2 selectable characters in 1-player mode and 8 selectable characters in 2-player mode which also features a long-nosed end boss. Progressive damage is shown on each fighter's face for a dramatic effect.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-044[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player[CR]= &gt; [A] Punching attack, [B] Kicking attack, [C] Throw enemy, [D] Taunt[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Ryuuko no Ken was released in September 1992 in Japan.[CR]The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Dragon and Tiger Fist'.[CR]This game is known outside Japan as Art of fighting" [CR]A bootleg of this game is known as "Fit of Fighting".[CR]SNK's second fighting-game franchise. It was the first fighting game by SNK to feature the character designs of former SNK illustrator Shinkiro, who would go on to do the character designs for the later "Fatal Fury" and "The King of Fighters" games.[CR]This is the first fighting game to feature the 'camera zoom' - where the camera zooms in when the fighters are close together and zooms out when the fighters move away from each other. This is also the first fighting game to utilize a 'spirit meter'. Every time a special move is executed the spirit meter is depleted accordingly. The more powerful the special move, the more it depletes. When it's empty special moves can't be done anymore, however, you can recharge the spirit meter by standing still and holding the A or B button leaving you totally defenseless.[CR]Robert Garcia design was inspired by the famous actor Steven Seagal.[CR]Takuma Sakazaki desgin was inspired by Masutatsu Oyama.[CR]The Haou Shokou Ken was referred to as the Haou Ken (or as the game put it, the 'Haow-Ken'). Its similarity to Ryu's (of "Street Fighter" fame) Hadou Ken forced the name change.[CR]The character's fighting stance and their victory pose depends on how beaten up they are.[CR]Lee Pai Long is called Lee Piron in the game's source code.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Todoh, Jack, Lee, King, Micky and John : player 2 must join.[CR]* Play as Mr. Big and Mr. Karate : reach them on 1P Game, then player 2 must join.[CR]* Move Command Delay : its possible to input the commands for any special or super move but it is not necessary to press the corresponding attack button right away, this allows you to delay any move for as long as you want in order to surprise an opponent! This trick also enables you to perform slower versions of some special moves such as projectile attacks. Try it! :)[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Ryuuko no Ken [Model NGM-044] (1992)[CR]2.

Apparently, this game takes place a few years before the events occurred in "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" since Geese looks quite young and uses a very different fighting style (instead of his trademark Aikido which he learned in Japan). Another fact is the special ending when you defeat Geese (you get to see when he gives the order to eliminate Jeff Bogard who happens to be Terry &amp; Andy Bogard's father, before he heads to Japan to learn that country's martial art techniques). This fact also explains why Ryo Sakazaki is so damn powerful in his "Fatal Fury Special" appearance (after all, he was already a powerful &amp; skilled fighter and has had more time than most of the Fatal Fury characters to brush up on his techniques!). Obviously, all these storyline details were ignored in the King of Fighters series for the sake of convenience (All the "Art of Fighting" characters should be way older than the Fatal Fury characters in that game!).[CR]In Temjin's ending, Terry Bogard makes a guest appearance as a little boy![CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The Japanese version features different voice actors for some characters (John Crawley, Robert Garcia &amp; King).[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]Adjust the game difficulty setting up to level 8 in order to boost game's overall speed![CR]It may be downright cheap &amp; silly, but if you successfully manage to throw an opponent and then hit him with a special move as he gets up, you will dizzy your opponent! This can be done over and over again with most characters... :/[CR]Beat opponents with a special move at the end of the decisive round to see a special 'defeat' animation (some auto-combos &amp; special moves that lift the opponent of the ground won't work though).[CR]Defeat all opponents in two rounds only to fight a special battle against Fatal Fury's main villain &amp; owner of Southtown : Geese Howard (Notice that it is possible to use continues &amp; use different characters as long as you defeat your opponents in 'two rounds only'!). :)[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

			<plot>Raguy (c) 1991 Alpha Denshi Company, Limited.[CR]Raguy is an environmentally-themed side-scrolling platform game for one or two players. [CR]The player controls a heroic young man named 'Blue' (in the two-player game the second player controls 'Princess Fa', who has identical powers to Blue), whose peaceful home planet of 'Raguy' has been invaded by the evil Daruma tribe. The Daruma are polluting the planet as they consume its dwindling resources and it falls on Blue and the Princess to stop them and save Raguy. [CR]Both Blue and Princess Fa have the ability to stun enemies by hitting them with a large leaf. Once stunned, they can be picked up and thrown as projectiles at other enemies. Blue and Princess Fa can also shrink in size in order to access hidden areas, but they are not able to stun enemies while shrunk. If only one player is shrunk, they can be picked up by the other player and thrown as a projectile at the enemies. [CR]Flowers, bonus items and power-ups are littered throughout the levels. The flowers are the game's form of currency and can be used in the shops that are located throughout the game. There are two different types of shop, offering either tips and help with overcoming certain obstacles, or health and weapon power-ups.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID: NGM-022[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons: 3[CR]=&gt; [A] Throw Enemy, [B] Jump, [C] Change Size[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Raguy was released in March 1991 in Japan.[CR]This game is known outside Japan as Blue's Journey.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]There are multiple endings to the game :[CR]- Get a high score to live happily ever after.[CR]- Get a very low score to get the cold shoulder from the princess.[CR]- Beat the game while being cursed.[CR]- If you challenged your rival early in the game he will challenge you again.

If the pitcher then hits you, tap Up twice on your joystick. Your hitter will then throw his bat to the floor, walk up to the mound and punch the pitcher, thus lowering his abilities. Using this tip will help mess up the pitching schedule for your opponent, and can lead to easy scoring opportunities off the tired pitchers.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

Players must battle through sideways-scrolling levels, to defeat armies of cyborgs and androids and restore order and peace to the world.[CR]Cyber-Lip has two shooting modes, one for standard weapon use and one for rocket launchers and grenade throwing. Players can switch between the two modes at any time, but only carry a limited amount of grenades or rockets. Weapon power-ups and additional grenades and rockets can be picked up throughout the levels.[CR]At the end of certain levels, the game's heroes will enter an elevator and players can then choose whether to go 'up' or 'down', depending on which route through the game they wish to take. Each level has a large end-of-level boss that must be defeated.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID: Model NGM-010[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Control Picture][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player (3 usables)[CR]=&gt; [Joystick] 8-way, [A] Shoot, [B] Jump, [C] Arms select[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Cyber-Lip was released in November 1990.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Producer : Eikichi Kawasaki[CR]Directors : Deru-Deru, Ousama[CR]Programmer : Shochan[CR]Sound : Tate Norio[CR]Front Designers : Higashi Pon, Miss.Jra[CR]Back Designers : Ok Goo!, Crazy Love[CR]Specail Thanks : Hi-Side, Yao- Yao, Oirabero, Poppyusan, Moriyan, Shibayan, Kaneshiro!, Kumasan, Nishidon, Dimajin, John Guso[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]SNK Neo-Geo [JP] (July 1, 1991; "Cyber-Lip [Model NGH-010]")[CR]SNK Neo-Geo [US] (July 1, 1991; "Cyber-Lip [Model NGH-010]")[CR]SNK Neo-Geo CD [JP] (April 21, 1995; "Cyber-Lip [Model NGCD-010]")[CR]SNK Neo-Geo CD [US] (April 21, 1995; "Cyber-Lip [Model NGCD-010E]")[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Double Dragon (c) 1995 Technos.[CR]A head-to-head fighting game based on the 1994 Double Dragon movie, the game features a roster selectable which consists of "Double Dragon" alumni Billy, Jimmy, Marian, Abobo and Burnov, as well as 5 original characters as they enter a martial arts tournament to take out evil crime lord of Bloody Town, Koga Shuko. Unique features in the game includes destructible environments and a super move meter which fills out based on how much energy the player has left, giving weaker fighters a handicap. After defeating the default 10 fighters, the player faces Shuko's bodyguard, Duke, before fighting Shuko himself.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : 0082[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2610 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 4[CR]=&gt; [A] Light Attack [B] Medium Attack [C] Hard Attack [D] Extra Attack[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in February 1995. Double Dragon was Technos' first game for the Neo-Geo hardware. This game was based on the movie 'Double Dragon', which was, in turn, based on the 'Double Dragon series' of games.[CR]The game features a combo counter like many fighting games, however this one is not always very accurate since it registers Cheng Fu's Super Dragon Kick technique (Forward Dragon Punch motion + 2 buttons with the charge meter filled) as a single hit! The original Double Dragon logo can be seen in the large white boat on Cheng Fu's stage![CR]Billy, Jimmy, Marian and Abobo are the only characters from the original 1987 "Double Dragon" game who were featured in both : the movie and this game. Billy and Jimmy have the ability to transform into more powerful counterparts like they did in the end of the movie, while Abobo turns into his mutated form for a brief moment when he does his 'Grow 'n Throw' super move. Marian is depicted as a female gang leader, much like her movie counterpart. Burnov was the first stage boss in "Double Dragon II - The Revenge", while Duke was the final boss in the Super NES game "Super Double Dragon", although neither character were in the movie. Koga Shuko, the game's final boss, was an original character from the film.[CR]April Simmonds holds the official record for this game with 96,700 points on April 21, 2007.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Double Dragon - G.S.M 1500 - PCCB-00175) on March 17, 1995.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]MVS (arcade) vs. Home (neo-geo) differences :[CR]- Arcade : If you beat the game without losing a round you'll see a drawing of each character posing while the credits roll. If you beat using a continue you just see the credits rolling on the screen in one of the monitors that fell on the last boss.[CR]- Home : Regardless if you use continues or not you will only get the credits that roll on the big monitor screen.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play As Duke / As Koga Shuko : Go to the character selection screen and put the cursor on Billy, then Marian, then Chung Fu, then Jimmy for 3 seconds each. If done correctly you will hear the word 'Bingo!'.[CR]* Alternate Costume Colors : Press B, C or D when selecting a fighter.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Aoni Production : Yasuaki Sumi[CR]Programmers : Tadamichi Obinata, Naoki Kashiwabara, Shinji Hirao, Yasuhiro Matsumoto[CR]Graphic Designers : Takumi Ishikawa, Seiichiro Ishiguro, Fujimi Oonishi, Kazutaka Oohashi, Satoshi Kazato, Takahide Koizumi, Chihiro Kushibe, Takeyoshi Suzuki, Katsuhiro Nakamura, Akiko Maruyama, Kazumi Minagawa, Koji Ogata, Koji Yamada, Hideki Hoshiya[CR]Planners : Muneki Ebinuma, Minoru Yamaguchi[CR]Sound Program &amp; Tools : Robert C.

Joe Higashi also enters the tournament in search of the championship title. Who will come out victorious? The main features in this story-driven fighter are backgrounds that feature two battle planes for pseudo 3-D action, &amp; excellent music![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-033[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player (3 usables)[CR][JOYSTICK] 8-way [A] Punch [B] Kick [C] Skill[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Garou Densetsu was released in November 1991 in Japan.[CR]The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Legend of Hungry Wolf - Battle of Destiny'.[CR]This game is known outside Japan as 'Fatal Fury - King of Fighters'. [CR]Originally called 'Real Bout', SNK opted to change the title to 'Fatal Fury'. You can see the game's original title on the banner of a store in the background of Hwa Jai's stage ('Real Bout Shop').[CR]According to the USA flyer, the name of the game is 'Fatal Fury - The Battle of Fury'. On the ingame titlescreen, however, it's called 'Fatal Fury - King of Fighters'.[CR]The official name of the tournament is 'The King of Fighters'. This can be verified if you look closely the promo poster seen in the name rankings. Later SNK would use this name for a popular game series of its own.[CR]The music in a 2-player battle is taken from the first stage of "Street Smart".[CR]This is the very first game that featured one of SNK's most famous fighters : Terry Bogard! Over the years, Terry Bogard has appeared in many games, usually in his familiar jacket with a star on his back and a cap on his head. However, what is on his cap is different (probably because he tosses so many of them, but that's a different story). Some games have him wear a blank cap, some have his cap say 'Running Wild', some have the Neo-Geo logo on them, but the commonly accepted cap is the one that says 'Fatal Fury' on it.[CR]Terry Bogard appears in "Quiz King of Fighters" as selectable character.[CR]This game was such a hit in Japan that an animated movie was released featuring character designs by Masami Ohbari. This movie's plot is fairly true to the game's main plot and all the characters in the game are featured. The movie was released on the USA by courtesy of Viz Video, a division of Viz Comics.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Garou Densetsu, Last Resort - PCCB-00087) on 21/05/1992.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The Japanese version features quite different move list sets for the three main characters (In the Fatal Fury sequels as well as the King of Fighters, Terry, Andy &amp; Joe's move list sets are clearly based on the Japanese release of this particular game). All other versions feature very simplified joystick commands for each move.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]As the game sometimes says on the continuation screen, you can tell some opponents' weak points by watching their moves carefully, which can help you figure out how to beat them. Here are a few examples :[CR]-- If you've knocked down an opponent, you can damage them some more by charging at them with a 'dash attack' just as they're getting up, until they've been fully beaten. This may work best when playing with Andy Bogard.[CR]-- When Tung Fu Rue changes into a hefty beast Incredible Hulk-style, he'll be briefly intangible as he beats his chest. Wait until the right moment and then dash at him (or, if you're playing with Joe Higashi, you can use his rapid punch). He won't actually fall on the ground in this form, but he'll be easier to beat until he turns back to normal as long as you can keep dash-attacking him.[CR]-- When you're facing Hwa Jai, he'll be thrown a bottle of some kind of drink by an agent of Geese standing within the crowd of spectators, and after drinking it (during which time he'll be briefly intangible too), that's when he really lets loose with damaging attacks. If you feel Hwa Jai's too hard to deal with this way, you can try to cause him damage by a small amount, and if your lifebar is still higher than his, you can then step back on defense. He'll try hitting you with standard punches and kicks, but will not throw you, and this way, you can keep on the defensive until the timer runs out, winning simply by having more life energy left than he does.[CR]-- When facing Billy Kane, if his pole falls away (he can either throw it at you or it can fall when he's thrown to the ground), he'll go on the defensive until another agent of Geese's tosses him another pole from within the crowd on the bridge. When he jumps up to grab hold of it, that's when you can move in and try to grab and throw him to the ground, or ram him with a dash attack.[CR]Finally, when facing Geese Howard in the showdown match, you can move towards him as the round begins and then grab and throw him to the ground, then, by timing your attacks correctly, you can grab him in a body slam again when he gets up, eventually beating him by body-slamming him repeatedly. It's a tricky strategy, but it can work![CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Garou Densetsu - Shukumei no Tatakai [Model NGM-033] (1991, MVS)[CR]2.

According to the USA flyer, the name of the game is 'Fatal Fury 2 - The Sultan of Slugs Battle Royale'.[CR]Things that changed in this sequel :[CR]* This game allows you to switch between the background &amp; foreground planes at will (in the first game, you could only switch planes if the CPU was on a different battle plane!).[CR]* The game ditches the previous game's 3 button setup (punch, kick &amp; throw) in favor of a new 4 button setup (light &amp; heavy punches &amp; kicks). This is apparently one of the very first Neo-Geo fighters to use this now common button setup.[CR]* This game introduces the use of Desperation Moves (highly damaging techniques that can only be used when the life-bar is flashing red). This game as well as "Art of Fighting" were the first fighting games to introduce these moves.[CR]* Newcomers in the game are : Mai Shiranui, Cheng Sinzan, Kim Kaphwan, Jubei Yamada, Big Bear (aka Raiden), Axel Hawk, Lawrence Blood &amp; Wolfgang Krauser. Richard Meyer, Michael Max, Tung Fu Rue, Duck King, Hwa Jai &amp; Geese Howard were left out! (although some of them make some cameos during some of the game's cut-scenes!).[CR]Just as the first game introduced the famed Terry Bogard, this game features SNK's most popular fighter lady : Mai Shiranui! :). Mai appears in "Quiz King of Fighters" as selectable character.[CR]The Hungry Wolf is a reference to Terry Bogard, the main character in Fatal Fury. Terry, Andy and Joe (and to a lesser extent, Mai and Mary) are referred to as the Lone Wolves.[CR]Keeping the tradition of the first game, an animated movie based on this game was released in Japan featuring character designs by Masami Ohbari. The movie was also released in the USA by Viz Video, a division of Viz Comics. After the second Fatal Fury movie was released, a third movie followed (which predated "Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory"). It follows the adventures of the Lonely Wolves (Terry, Andy, Joe and Mai) as they attempt to prevent a power-hungry man from claiming all the parts of the legendary Armor of Mars.[CR]When a player wins a match in a single player game, the post match screen shows people watching the tournament inside the Pao Pao Cafe from the first game, "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters".[CR]Pony Canyon released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Garou Densetsu 2 - PCCB-00111) on 19/02/1993.[CR]Reviews:[CR][FR] March 1993 - Consoles + No. 18: 97/100 (AES version)[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* You can only see any character's ending if you beat the game with a single credit used (no continues or 2-Player matches are allowed)[CR]* Just like the first game, it's possible to use the strategy of dashing at your opponents just as they're getting up in order to damage them repeatedly.[CR]* Billy Kane, Axel Hawk and Lawrence Blood all have stages that use a single plane, with the 'second' plane having objects on it that can injure players if they're knocked against them (all three of these bosses have ways of throwing their opponents into the background). You can knock the bosses into the background too by standing close to them while they're dazed and then hitting them with a good hard kick or punch.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

The game features a new graphic style, 2 different background planes to fight, a grade system that shows how well you perform in battle, lots of hidden moves &amp; combos, as well as multiple endings based on your performance. The answers shall only be uncovered by a long &amp; fierce battle, are you up to it?[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID: NGM-069[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons Per Player.[CR][Joystick] 8-way [A] Quick Punch [B] Quick Kick [C] Power Punch [D] Power Kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Garou Densetsu 3 was released in March 1995 in Japan.[CR]The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Legend of Hungry Wolf 3 - The Distant Battle'.[CR]Garou Densetsu 3 overtly refers to itself by its overseas name of 'Fatal Fury 3' throughout the game.[CR]This game is known outside Japan as 'Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory'.[CR]Things that changed in this particular game:[CR]* The game introduces a deeper plane change system which proved to be somewhat clunky &amp; difficult to use due to the tricky commands used to move between planes.[CR]* Chain combos are introduced to add even more depth to each character's fighting style. [CR]* Throws are harder to use since these are slow and throw-miss animations were added.[CR]* Newcomers in the game are Bob Wilson, Blue Mary, Franco Bash, Hon Fu, Sokaku Mochizuki, Ryuji Yamazaki, Jin Chonshu &amp; Jin Chonrei.[CR]Hon Fu's goofy martial artist routine &amp; easygoing personality make him SNK's hilarious homage to Jackie Chan. Definitely not a Bruce Lee clone! :)[CR]Kyo Kusanagi &amp; Sie Kensou make a cameo in Pao Pao Cafe![CR]Pony Canyon released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Garou Densetsu 3 - PCCB-00179) on April 21, 1995.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]Reach and beat Jin Chonshu with a fighting grade above "A" and you'll fight a hidden last boss, her brother, Jin Chonrei.[CR]One of the coolest things of this game is the fact that you can alter some backgrounds objects by slamming opponents against them. For example, you can knock away the training dummy in Joe's stage if you send an opponent flying towards it. Experiment on various stages to find more surprises![CR]Note : If the game is set on the USA, ASIA or EUROPE bios, the game will reset after defeating Jin Chonrei and you won't get to see the ending, however if the game is set on the JAPAN bios it will work just fine![CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

Musashi had an opportunity to see Kojiro's sword sometime before the duel and knew of it's great length. Musashi carved the wooden sword to be of greater length. When Musashi arrived on the beach for the duel, he kept the wooden sword hidden behind him until the duel began. He jumped over a low strike of Kojiro, reaching about a meter off the ground and came down hard on Kojiro's head with his heavy wooden sword. Kojiro lay dying on the sand and Musashi left in a hurry without killing him. Some of Musashi's critics call him a coward for not killing him, but Musashi had proved his point as the killing of Kojiro was not the goal - defeating him was. This is why the Kojiro character in Musashi Ganryuki has a huge gash on his forehead. The storyline of Musashi Ganryuki is that Kojiro has come back from the dead to try and kill Musashi.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]Here are the statistics for the two characters :[CR]Musashi : Power 4 - Dexterity 2 - Vitality 4[CR]Suzume : Power 2 - Dexterity 5 - Vitality 3[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Producer : Ume.W[CR]Programmers : S.

			<plot>Garou - Mark of the Wolves (c) 1999 SNK.[CR]The 9th 'Fatal Fury' episode brings us 12 characters and foregoes the plane-switching style of its predecessors in favour of standard single-plane battles. One of the last games produced by the original SNK.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-253[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player.[CR][JOYSTICK] 8-way [A] Swift punch [B] Swift kick [C] Pummeler punch [D] Colossal kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in November 1999.[CR]'Garou' translates from Japanese as 'Hungry Wolf'. 'Mark of the Wolves' is a reference to the legacy left behind by Terry to a new generation of fighters - specifically, Rock Howard. This can also refer to the legacy left by other characters from the previous Fatal Fury &amp; Art of Fighting games. Kim Dong Hwan &amp; Kim Jae Hoon are sons of Tae-Kwon Do fighter Kim Kaphwan. Khushmood Butt is a master of Kyokugenryu Karate, the same martial used by Ryo Sakazaki from Art of Fighting. Hokutomaru uses Shiranui-style Ninjitsu as his fighting style, this is the same ninja arts that Mai Shiranui uses, however Hokutomaru was trained by Andy Bogard.[CR]Garou pushes the capabilities of the Neo-Geo MVS hardware to its limit, giving some of the best-looking graphics to date. Some critics saying that there is life after all in the Neo-Geo hardware, which was past its prime when the game was released.[CR]Hokutomaru's stage has quite a few references to the rest of the "Fatal Fury" series. To the extreme left of the stage is a billboard with a picture of the old style Terry Bogard. A portrait of Geese Howard and his lieutenants can be seen on another billboard (this is the same picture that is seen in the flyer for Real Bout Fatal Fury). There is also a picture of Andy Bogard and Mai Shiranui holding hands posing as a bank advertisement right above another picture of Alfred.[CR]The sign that Khushnood Butt shows off in his victory pose is a Kyokugen Karate dojo sign.[CR]The Rock Howard music stage contains a part of Robert Miles' seminal trance tune Children.[CR]Rock Howard is the son of the notorious crime-lord Geese Howard, the boss of previous Fatal Fury games. Rock was trained to fight by Terry Bogard and has incorporated moves from Terry and Geese's styles into his own fighting style. Rock is also related to Garou's main boss of the game: Kain R. Heinlein. Geese Howard married Marie Heinlein, whom is the sister of Kain. So, we can assume that Kain is Rock's uncle.[CR]The word 'Tizoc' (The Griffon Mask's Japanese name) means 'sick leg', or 'lame leg'. It was the name of an ancient Mexican tlatoani, or leader, who ruled from 1481 until 1486, when he was poisoned by Aztec aristocrats.[CR]If a double KO occurs, a round is won by each fighter, which can end a battle on this quite unsatisfying note. Moreover in this case, the player has no fighting level, neither displayed on the screen nor counted for the points.[CR]Soundtracks release:[CR][JP] Jan. 21, 2000; Garou - Mark of the Wolves [SCDC-00006] Scitron[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The prototype version has a white background at the title screen instead a blue background on the final version. It has also a graphic bug on the Terry Bogard stage during the second round at the extreme right.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Random Fighter : Hold Start and press a Punch or Kick button at the character selection screen.[CR]* Play as Grant : At the character select screen, highlight Dong Hwan, hold Start and press Up(x2) Down(x2), Up, Down.[CR]* Play as Kain R. Heinlein : At the character select screen, highlight Jae Hoon, hold Start and press Down(x2), Up(x2), Down, Up.[CR]* Play against Kain R. Heinlein : To reach Kain, you must finish the first 7 matches with an average fighting level of AAA. Your best bet would be to avoid losing any rounds throughout the preliminary 7 stages, especially Grant. If you meet this condition after defeating Grant, you'll get a cutscene featuring Kain R. Heinlein. Beat Kain to reveal your characters' true ending.[CR]* Alternate Costume Colors : Each character has 4 colors, corresponding to each button.[CR]* Secret Taunts : After defeating your opponent, hold Left or Right and tap Start to use an hidden taunt. Every character has two secret taunts (these can ONLY be used after defeating an opponent and before your character goes into his/her winning pose). Some of them, such as Hotaru's and Hokutomaru's are really cool! :)[CR]Taunts in the game can affect the background stages in many ways. For example, by using a taunt during a fight in Hotaru's stage (Philanthropy Belfry) you can make the bells in the background move. Most stages have hidden animations that can only be seen by this trick so try it! :)[CR]* Survival Mode : Insert a coin, hold A+B+C+D and press Start. You will then play a Survival Mode (quite hard one too).[CR]* Rock's Win-pose : Rock will have a special win-pose when he finishes the opponent with a Shine Knuckle and a different one when he finishes the opponent with either a Raging Storm or the Deadly Rave Neo.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

The basic premise is the same : a girl in an RPG-style format walking along a world map and encountering enemies which are battled through mahjong matches. The enemy encounter screens have identical borders and the enemies are drawn in the same comic-anime style. Before each mahjong match, there are selectable spells that can be bought with stored MP, the screen and spells being identical in both cases. The player also has a Sword and Shield which can be activated during a match which give the player special abilities. The in-game text is virtually identical. The mahjong tiles themselves look almost exactly the same save for the backs; the mahjong game screen itself is almost exactly the same. Even upon defeating an enemy, they are turned into a scantily-clad woman as does your character when she is defeated. The only major difference between the two seems to be that "Mahjong Quest" is controlled with a mahjong control panel and Jyanshin Densetsu is controlled with the MVS Neo-Geo joystick.

			<plot>Karnov's Revenge (c) 1994 Data East Corp.[CR]The quest to defeat the mysterious Baron of Battlers, the mysterious "K", is on. In order to get to this grotesque gladiator, you need to fight your way through 13 with the most skilled, most deadly of all combatants in the world of physical contact. Use your powers of pulverization, psychic energy blasts, and ridiculous strength to become the explosive fighting god in FIGHTER'S HISTORY DYNAMITE!!![CR]Don't just participate in history, MAKE IT! The sequel of the first "Fighter's History", this time ported in the Neo Geo MVS Hardware. In this new version of the original game several changes and improvements were made to enhance the gameplay: now the battles are faster and more technical, with the usual friendly combo system that makes the fight so spectacular. There are also some powerful hidden moves added for most of the characters. Even the graphic was slightly enhanced, with a nice color palette and some wonderful backgrounds (especially Zazie's).[CR]The game actually suffered from the reputation to be a 'SFII clone' given by the general opinion from the first episode. Thanks to this new chapter of the saga, which was particularly appreciated by the Neo Geo fans because it is one of the rare 'SFII style' beat'em ups on the Neo Geo this changed.[CR]A really nice and classical beat'em up, still worthy to be played, especially for the real fans of the 2-D beat'em up.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-066[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 Players - 4 Buttons Per Player.[CR]=&gt;[Joystick] 8-Way, [A] Fast Punch [B] Strong Punch [C] Fast Kick [D] Strong Kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Karnov's Revenge was released March 17, 1994. An important fact about this game is that it's the third Data East game to be manufactured on the Neo-Geo hardware.[CR]This game is known in Japan and USA as "Fighter's History Dynamite" while in Europe as Karnov's Revenge.[CR]New features and changes of the game:[CR]* The controls discard the six button system of the first episode for the typical four buttons of the Neo Geo pad. In this way, the middle punch and middle kick attack are no longer available.[CR]* New stages for every character and new background music.[CR]* The portrait of every character was retouched a bit. Especially, the portraits of FeiLin and Karnov were both redrawn.[CR]* New color schemes for the alternative suit's color of every character. However, the standard suit color of all the characters is still the same as that of the first Fighter's History episode.[CR]* New vocal samples for every characters, except for Clown, Karnov and Mizoguchi: however, for Mizoguchi new samples for the win poses and a new 'scream of defeat' was added (in the first Fighter's History, when Mizoguchi lost, she emitted the generic KO sample shared with other characters).[CR]* The in-game sprites of every character were retouched slightly in some determinate frames. [CR]* The design of Karnov was redrawn from the first episode.[CR]* Faster gameplay. [CR]* New moves and new tricks for every character.[CR]* New endings for every character. Even Clown and Karnov now have their own ending sequence.[CR]The stage of Marstorius takes place in a ring placed inside the Colosseum of Rome.[CR]The three children in the middle of the Samchay's stage are the two little brothers and sister of Samchay.[CR]The extra round against the bull named 'Ox' (see TIPS AND TRICKS section to learn more) is a retrieval to the similar bonus game in "Karate Champ" (one of the first fighting games of the history, developed by same Data East on 1984).[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Fighter's History Dynamite &amp; Flying Power Disc - PCCB-00149) on March 18, 1994.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Karnov's Revenge introduced 'one-two attacks' to the series. Players can press a Strong attack button while connecting with a Weak attack button to chain the attacks into themselves.[CR]The following special moves aren't listed in the instruction manual. These secret moves aren't super moves, just hidden special moves with less obvious motions. Samchay, Clown, and Karnov do not have these moves. Here's a quick legend: U=Up, D=Down, B=Back, F=Forward, DF=Down/Forward, and so on. A=Button A (LP), B=Button B (HP), C=Button C (LK), D=Button D (HK).

[CR]* If you beat the game without losing a single round you'll get an extra secret fight against a bull (Ox).[CR]* Weak Points: The Weak Points and the relates dizzy system remained the same of the first episode. Thus, heavy hits will flash the weak point (determinate part of the suit of the character) and after a while further hits taken will make fly away the weak point with a BOING! sound and the character will get dizzy.

			<plot>The King of Fighters 2000 (c) 2000 SNK.[CR]34 characters, plus the popular striker system, await to be selected to team up and defeat the mighty Zero and his incredible bladed coat![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-257[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player.[CR][JOYSTICK] 8-way, [A] Weak punch, [B] Weak kick, [C] Strong punch, [D] Strong kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in July 2000.[CR]About Ramon : This character was designed with one of Neo-Geo's major markets in mind, South America. He's a stout, masked wrestler who uses tricky body slam moves. These 3 points form the major concept behind the creation of Ramon. Ramon's designer at the time loved pro-wrestling fighting moves, and we remember him carefully studying these. The fruits of this labor crystallized themselves in the Lucha Dolore known as Ramon. With his use of 'Lucha Libre' moves and not those of traditional 'pro-wrestling', the staff team hope you can enjoy experiencing the attention to detail, intensity, and enthusiasm of Ramon's designer at that time.[CR]About Vanessa : Vanessa's entrance in KOF at the time put a stop to the parade of increasingly younger characters appearing in the game, especially the women characters who were all teenagers for the most part. This is the reason for creating the concept of a thirty-something woman who broke all the rules and overflowed with adult appeal. Her style has become the topic of many humorous comic strips. In her first appearance in the Sega Dreamcast version of KOF '99 as a Striker character, she was a bit irreverent. And in KOF 2000, she officially entered the tournament as a player character. Designers wanted to introduce her as a player character in KOF '99, but legend has it that she had to sit it out due to certain time constraints.[CR]About Lin : This character was selected out of the encyclopedic character background materials (whose volume would rival the Encyclopedia Britannica!) of the supervising planners. Lin is tied to the Flying Brigands 'HIzoku', who were introduced as a KOF side story in the NESTS Chronicles, but without the knowledge of the staff, and when Ron showed up in the ending sequence, there were some awfully surprised designers. With all the special moves and actions for this character the programmers and planners had a rough time working on this character. He brought tears to the eyes of the developers, but not for the usual reasons.[CR]About Seth : Seth was created as part of a set with Vanessa, appearing for the first time in the Sega Dreamcast version of KOF '99. His initial name was 'Dick'. The name had deep significance for his designer. Based on the strong wishes of the supervising designer, the powerful image of a big, dark, middle-aged man with a Mohawk haircut who used the arts of self-defense was decided on. Since Seth was created first, Vanessa's clothes were designed to match his. This made some people surmise things like Seth was Vanessa's husband.[CR]About Hinako Shijo : At first designers sought to create a character similar to Chie in the Japanese comic Jarinko Chie (Downtown Story) who used sumo moves. The supervising designer, however, succumbed to insistent requests to use 'a debutante', and Hinako gradually transformed into a wellborn young maiden. She was to fight barefoot, but that idea got eighty-sixed. The tape remaining on her fingers is a tiny remnant of her original concept. Since her appearance grew further and further away from that of a sumo wrestler, the names for her moves use those of actual sumo moves to preserve the essence of the sumo wrestler in her original character.[CR]About Kula Diamond : To add dimensions to the villainous NESTS organization of the NESTS Chronicles and excitement to the story, the need to create an enemy for the huge and individualistic K' arose. Manipulator of the 'Anti-K' Arts', her ice symbolizes the foil to the flames of K'. That's what Kula Diamond's all about. During production Designers elicited the opinions of newly hired female designers regarding Kula's mannerisms to "make her girlish gestures appropriately girlish" (but left the actual design work to the veteran supervising designer). Designers think we succeeded in faithfully depicting a 14-year-old girl... Asking Kula's designer about his impressions at the time, he immediately answered : "Kula had an easy delivery. She didn't give me any pain". The actual work appeared difficult, but it seems he enjoyed his work.[CR]About Candy Diamond : Candy is the robot you can see during Kula's Special Move displays, animated sequences, and as a Striker. Since Candy's not a player character she doesn't stand out like the other characters, but she does appear in the gut-wrenching episode that depicts her emotions for Kula when she's torched saving her mistress in the Kula ending of KOF 2000. If you haven't yet seen this, what're you waiting for? Hurry up and clear the game with Kula to find out![CR]About Zero : Zero is the boss of Krizalid from KOF '99, but his position in a company would be similar to that of 'division chief'. Because of his black beard and noble manner, designers are sure he's regarded as a rather scary 'division chief' in the organization. His guiltless betrayal of Krizalid speaks volumes about his true personality, in stark contrast to his dislike of traitors listed in his profile. Incidentally, The names of some of Zero's moves come from the Japanese anime 'Hokuto no Ken'.[CR]About Diana : Diana's the Amazon featured in Kula's sequences. She used to be a top executive for NESTS but is portrayed as Kula's guardian in the background story. If you compared NESTS to a company... designers often use this metaphor, but designers don't have a clue which position would fit her or Foxy. Judging by her loathing of elite managers (college boys), designers could say she's a 'big-sister section chief' who climbed the corporate ladder with extremely hard work. Working with a "fabulous babe" boss like her would be whack (but a bit scary, though)![CR]Robert's 'Ryuugeki Ken' is a knock-off of the Sonic Boom (It isn't in "The King of Fighters '99 - Millennium Battle" because of its looks, despite the charging motion).[CR]There are 2 symbolic things that tell you how the people at SNK were forseeing the end of their company. Kyo's theme is called 'Good Bye Esaka', Esaka is the avenue where the SNK building and Neo Geo Land are (Esaka means 'entrance to the hill'). The second thing is the destruction of the city that started all : South Town (Home of "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" and "Art of Fighting" - however, note that in "Garou - Mark of The Wolves", Second South was rebuilt near South Town. Also noted is the fact that every Kyo theme before 'Tears' had 'Esaka' in it ('Esaka' in 94, 'Funky Esaka' in 95, 'Esaka?' in 96 and 'Esaka Forever' in 97).[CR]The reason for those names is that in "The King of Fighters '94", Kyo's team stage is below a bridge in the Esaka area near SNK. In "The King of Fighters '95", they fight in front of Neo Geo Land, again, in Esaka in front of the SNK building. In "The King of Fighters '96", they fight in top of a bridge also in the Esaka area. In "The King of Fighters '97" there is no Esaka stage, however, this was supposed to be the last KOF as SNK planned to move to the Hyper NeoGeo 64, it was like a glorious farewell to KOF, however, things went different. Finally, in "The King of Fighters '98 - The Slugfest", the Esaka stage appears again; they fight below a bridge in front of the Neo Geo Land.[CR]* Origin of Alternate Strikers :[CR]Another Benimaru (Benimaru) : Alternate art for Benimaru.[CR]Another K' (K') : Alternate art for K'.[CR]Another Robert (Robert) : Alternate art for Robert (inspired from the early "Art of Fighting" days).[CR]Athena (Athena) : Athena as she appeared in her first game, "Athena".[CR]Baijang (Chin) : (Not too sure, but it could be Tung Fu Rue's panda).[CR]Billy Kane (Andy) : "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" (Andy is second banana for the good guys, Billy is second banana for the bad guys).[CR]Chizuru Kagura (Mai) : KOF, Mai's teammate in '97/'98.[CR]Chris (Whip) : KOF, part of the New Face Team.[CR]Cosplayer Kyoko (Shingo) : A girl dressing up as Kyo (in his old outfit), Kyoko is the 'feminine form' of Kyo (ie, what Christina would be to Chris) - Voice by Haruna Ikezwa.[CR]Duck King (Joe) : "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters".[CR]Duke Edwards (Ramon) : "Burning Fight" - Voice by Kong Kuwata.[CR]Eiji Kisaragi (Lin) : "Art of Fighting".[CR]Fiolina Germi (Vanessa) : "Metal Slug - Super vehicle-001".[CR]Foxy (Kula) : KOF, Kula's guardian.[CR]Gai Tendou (Takuma) : Main character in "Buriki One in Tokyo - World Grapple Tournament '99", where Ryo has a cameo - Voice by Nobuyuki Hiyama.[CR]Geese Howard (Terry) : Terry's old nemesis from "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters".[CR]Goenitz (Leona) : KOF, final boss in "The King of Fighters '96".[CR]Goro Daimon (Seth) : KOF '94-'98 (retired at the time to raise children).[CR]Kaede (Ryo) : "The Last Blade".[CR]Kang Baedal (Jhun) : Original design for Jhun - Voice by Eiji Takemoto.[CR]Kaoru Watabe (Bao) : KOF (Kaoru is an Athena fan who lost both her legs and her fan letter to Athena was what made her join the '97 tournament, Kaoru now has artificial legs, thanks to Athena) - Voice by Ayako Kawasumi.[CR]Kensou (Kensou) : Kensou as he appeared in his first game, "Psycho Soldier".[CR]Kim Dong Hwan (Chang) : "Garou - Mark of the Wolves", Kim's older son.[CR]Kim Jae Hoon (Choi) : "Garou - Mark of the Wolves", Kim's younger son.[CR]Kim Sue-Il (Kim) : "Kizuna Encounter - Super Tag Battle" - Voice by Yoshiaki Fujita.[CR]Lilly Kane (Hinako) : "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters", Billy's younger sister and Joe's girlfriend - Voice by Yumi Kakazu.[CR]Li Xiangfei (Kasumi) : "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters", Kasumi's teammate in '99.[CR]Mature/Vice (Iori) : Iori's teammates from '96/'98.[CR]Nakoruru (Yuri) : "Samurai Shodown".[CR]Rocky (Maxima) : Player 2's character from "Robo Army".[CR]Ryuji Yamazaki (Mary) : "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters", Mary's teammate in '97/'98.[CR]Shermie (Clark) : KOF, part of the New Face Team.[CR]Shishi-Ou/King Lion (King) : Main villain in "Savage Reign" - Voice by Katsuhisa Nakatsuka.[CR]Sho Kirishima (Kyo) : Original design for Kyo.[CR]Yashiro Nanakase (Ralf) : KOF, part of the New Face Team.[CR]* Maniac Striker Origins :[CR]Another Iori (Iori) : Alternate art for Iori.[CR]Cool Choi (Choi) : Alternate art for Choi.[CR]G-Mantle (Ryo) : This character is King, appears in "Art Of Figthing 2" previous her battle in history mode.[CR]Neo &amp; Geo (Ramon) : They are not the SNK mascots :), they appear in the game "Quiz Daisousa Sen - The Last Count Down", where they are the private eyes Neo MacDonald and Geo Kentacky.[CR]Thier last names are a spoof to two Fast Food restaurant chains.[CR]Kentacky is the Japanese reading for Kentucky - Voice by Hiroyuki Arita.[CR]Rugal Bernstein (Kula) : KOF, considered to be the 'franchise boss' (much like Bison for SF).[CR]Saisyu Kusanagi (Kyo) : KOF, Kyo's father.[CR]Smart Chang (Chang) : Alternate art for Chang.[CR]Unknown (Kasumi) : "Art of Fighting", Kasumi's father (Ryuhaku Todo) - Voice by Arita Goto.[CR]Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.[CR]Soundtracks:[CR][JP] Aug. 23, 2000; The King of Fighters 2000 [SCDC-00035] - Scitron[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Japanese vs. USA differences :[CR]- Blood has been removed.[CR]- Mai's chest doesn't bounce.[CR]- The team specific ending musics have been replaced with one generic track.[CR]- The Ikari Team's ending has been modified.

			<plot>The King of Fighters 2001 (c) 2001 Eolith.[CR]With the largest KOF lineup totaling at 40 characters, newcomers Eolith do a great job at delivering high quality fighting action along with one of the most difficult pairs of bosses in fighting game history![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-262[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player.[CR][JOYSTICK] 8-way, [A] Light punch, [B] Light kick, [C] Strong punch, [D] Strong kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in October 2001.[CR]A hack of this game is known as "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon 2003".[CR]About Ron : the planners at the time enthusiastically came up with the idea of the Flying Brigands, the idea being to add a thrilling side story to KOF. Ron became the chief of this bunch. His first appearance came in the ending sequence for Benimaru's Team in KOF 2000. This ending sequence got first-rate reviews for its content and presentation, becoming one of the most popular episodes in the history of KOF. From KOF 2000 on, the background story became more complex on various levels, but subsequently SNK had a few problems (sniff, sniff) causing Ron's creators (the planners at the time) to go their different ways... Whenever the current staff who continue to work on KOF run into the original staff on the train to work, they are sure to grill them about Ron's background (thanks for your cooperation, by the way!). As a result of all this, he made a grand entrance as the boss characters' Striker in KOF 2001. The numerous characters who were involved with him, too, continue their exploits in the world of KOF even now. Ron is a character who uses the tricky actions from Chinese boxing and he continues work on reaching his ghoulish objective to be able to manipulate the dead. Just when he'll be able to appear as a player character is a mystery even to us...[CR]About May Lee : one reason of existence for May came from a consideration of the needs of our Korean fans. In addition to that, Eolith, a sponsor at the time, expressed their desire for a character like a 'Korean Athena'.  This request asked for an 'idol-like visual fighter', or something along that line, and designers recall that it really threw us for a loop. Through trial and error, designers arrived at a character that was a long way from the original concept, but with this process May Lee, the perky tae kwon do fighter for justice, was born. Designers got her name from the person who was in charge of Eolith (Eolith Co., Ltd.) at the time.[CR]About Foxy : Rumor has it that a lot of fans think Foxy died in KOF 2001, but she's alive and well (LAUGH). Initially there were no plans for her to become a player character, but her presence was needed as the story developed and she got the go-ahead. Originally Foxy was to be a character spun off from Diana, but it seems the plan just didn't work. In the end there just wasn't enough time; the graphics were worked out with great effort, but she got the boot as a result of time constraints.[CR]About K9999 : K9999 is Eolith's homage to Tetsuo from Akira. His voice actor also did Tetsuo. For various reasons K9999 is a scary character to deal with. Of course he's based on 'you know who' and has, well, similarities that we're happy a certain 'you know who' didn't object to. If you count the similarities between 'you know who' and the other 'you know who', you'd be counting from now to St. Swithun's Day. K9999 boasts a big following of fans in Korea and Japan, but no other character has such obstacles against him appearing in KOF again.[CR]About Angel : Angel was realized through the overwhelming passion of her designer (LAUGH). You could say that there was just no stopping him. You can see his preferences in almost every aspect of her. She's a real rascal who has a lot of special moves like the 'Unchained Circle' and is one tough customer to deal with. Designers splurged on the voice for Angel in KOF 2001 and hired Mina Tominaga, a famous Japanese voice actress. Angel's designer was quite pleased with that...[CR]About Zero (The Original) : the supervising designer was dissatisfied with KOF 2000's Zero so he struggled with his disappointment and completed this character. Must have been that little mustache (LAUGH). And the character of Glaugan (King Lion) at his side also got nixed and wasn't used in KOF 2000 either. Talk about not getting your way! Along with polishing Zero, he was tortured with mission to realize his first boss character after leaving SNK that surpassed Krizalid's presence and strength.[CR]About Igniz : since all designer's sponsor had to say to us-about 100 times-about Igniz was "make him hot", "make him hot", and "make him hot", Designers made him, well, a real stud. The standards for handsome characters in fighting games for Asian fans are exacting; and there is a tendency for people here to shy away from ugly and comic characters. Designer think he serves so well as a foil, the lead character comes off all the better.[CR]Yuri's battle start pose is a knock-off of Felicia's battle start pose in "Vampire Savior - The Lord Of Vampire". Besides this, Yuri has the special attack of Gouki, the one that grabs your opponent and then the screen turns black as he gives you 30 hits in 3 seconds. This move is called the 'Yuri Chou Enbu' (means 'Yuri Super Flame Dance'). The move can only be made with the special gauge at max (with at least 1 striker - The sequence is : A, A Forward, B, C). Yuri will get Gouki's 'Messatsu' pose if you finish your opponent with it. It's a parody of Gouki's super finish splash screen (the one with the kanji 'ten' on it when he finishes his opponent with the Shun Goku Satsu).[CR]Athena, in one of her win poses, dances about and says 'Yattai!' in a very familiar way... She's parodying Chun-Li![CR]The little kid that appears in Terry Bogard's win poses is none other than a young Rock Howard from "Garou - Mark of The Wolves". Since Garou takes place in 2008, Rock is still a young kid in training during this game.[CR]Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.[CR]Soundtracks:[CR][JP] Dec. 19, 2001; The King of Fighters 2001 - Original Sound Trax [SCDC-00143][CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]If you set the region to Korea in the MVS test menu, the voices of all of the Korea Team change and May Lee is renamed Lee Jinju[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Choose Your Winning Pose : Press a button immediately after beating the opponent and before the 'You Win' mark appears.

			<plot>The King of Fighters 2002 - Challenge to Ultimate Battle (c) 2002 Playmore Corp.[CR]Revived 3 on 3 battles and new MAX Activation System enable you to get more and more exciting showdowns.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-265[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player.[CR][JOYSTICK] 8-way, [A] Light punch, [B] Light kick, [C] Strong punch, [D] Strong kick,[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Developed by Eolith Co., Ltd.[CR]Released in October 2002.[CR]About Kusanagi : As the NESTS Chronicles began, Kyo's school uniform changed to a white outfit but his trademark was his black school uniform (even though he's over 20!). Because of some desired the return of the old Kyo, he was inserted into the game at the last moment. In KOF 2003, KUSANAGI was treated as phantom that Chizuru produced with the power of the Mirror of the Yata. But you can't have Kyo without a school uniform. Maybe in Chizuru's mind Kyo will always be a high school student.[CR]About Orochi Yashiro : The characters commonly referred to as Shadow Yashiro, Shadow Shermie, and Shadow Chris were first formulated to balance out the Japan Team of Kyo, Benimaru, and Daimon. Needless to say, Yashiro was 'a character who used powerful body slams associated with the earth and earthquakes' in the same vein Daimon did. He's a dynamic guy who doesn't fret over tiny details, but his hobby is playing guitar in his band. The band's name has never been officially revealed, but it is known as 'C.Y.S.' He idolizes the guitarist Paul Gilbert, and has quite a detailed background story to him.[CR]About Orochi Shermie : If Yashiro offsets Daimon, Shermie is Benimaru's counterpart who ''manipulates lightning and thunderclap attacks''. But the supervising planner made sure, through trial and error, Shermie would simply not become a ''female Benimaru''. Various ideas were added to make her a new, unique character. The ''Moonless Thundercloud'' Shermie heaves up with a belch is an example of this, as is the ''Willow Whip'' move she uses to mow down opponents with flailing arms. Incidentally, these moves were called the ''Explosive Belch'' and the ''Back off, You Beasty'' moves during development.[CR]About Orochi Chris : Chris, of course, is Kyo's counterpart, 'a manipulator of flame'. At the inception of production, the plan was for Chris to use the 'Flame of Darkness (Black Flame)', but the black flames were hard to see so the designers settled for purple ones. When it came time to name Chris's arsenal of moves, we remember the director saying, 'The Dark Orochi Wave sounds good'. But other planners objected : 'It's dumb for an Orochi character to have 'Orochi Wave' as a move name. It's like saying, Call me Mr. Chris'. Regardless, the director won out.[CR]The little kid that appears in Terry Bogard's win poses is none other than a young Rock Howard from "Garou - Mark of The Wolves". Since Garou takes place in 2008, Rock is still a young kid in training during this game.[CR]KOF2002 contains pieces of music from older KOFs. Here's a complete list of themes, the teams (or individuals) they belong to and the games they were taken from :[CR]Tears (Kyo Kusanagi) - "The King of Fighters '99 - Millennium Battle" (Kyo Kusanagi's theme music).[CR]Kurikinton (Fatal Fury Team) - "Fatal Fury 2" (Terry Bogard's theme music).[CR]Beauty &amp; The Beast (Art of Fighting Team) - "The King of Fighters 2000" (Art of Fighting Team's theme music).[CR]Jungle Bouncer (Ikari Team) - "The King of Fighters '94" (Ikari Team's theme music).[CR]Psycho Soldier (Athena Asamiya) - "Psycho Soldier" (what part of the game?).[CR]Diet (Gals Fighters Team) - "Art of Fighting 2" (Yuri Sakazaki's theme music).[CR]Arashi no Saxophone 2 (Iori Team) - "The King of Fighters '96" (Iori Team's theme music).[CR]Bloody (New Face Team) - "The King of Fighters '97" (New Face Team's theme music).[CR]KD-0079 (Hero Team) - "The King of Fighters '99 - Millennium Battle" (Hero Team's theme music).[CR]KD-0084 (2000 Team) - "The King of Fighters 2000" (Hero Team's theme music).[CR]Seoul ni Ikou (Kim) - "Fatal Fury 2" (Kim theme music).[CR]Soundtrack releases:[CR][JP] Nov. 20, 2002; The King of Fighters 2002 Original Sound Trax [SCDC-00221] - Scitron[CR]Some known hacks of this game are known as :[CR]"The King of Fighters 10th Anniversary - All Team Battle"[CR]"The King of Fighters 10th Anniversary 2005 Unique"[CR]"The King of Fighters 10th Anniversary Extra Plus"[CR]"The King of Fighters Special Edition 2004"[CR]"The King of Fighters 2002 Plus"[CR]"The King of Fighters 2002 Magic Plus"[CR]"The King of Fighters 2002 Magic Plus II"[CR]Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]If you put the game in 'Korea territory' via the MVS bios setting, all Korea Team's voices changes.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Kusanagi : at the character selection screen, highlight Kyo and press Up, Down, Right, Left, Down, Up, Left, Right.[CR]* Orochi versions of Sherimie, Chris And Yashiro : just hold down Start on them at the character selection screen.

			<plot>The King of Fighters 2003 (c) 2003 SNK Playmore.[CR]A new edition of the KOF series with 32 selectable fighters plus Evil Kusanagi, Chizuru and Maki Kagura, Adelheid Bernstein and the final boss Mukai.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-271[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player.[CR]=&gt;[Joystick] 8-way, [A] Light punch [B] Light kick [C] Strong punch [D] Strong kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in November 2003, KOF2k3 represents the latest opus in the series to run on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware.[CR]Two new systems have been adopted : 'Tactical Leader System' which sets up a leader favorably treated in capability in a team and 'Multi-Shift' in which player characters can be changed freely during 3 on 3 battle.[CR]About Ash Crimson : Unlike the usual KOF hero characters, Ash was designed with the intent to create an 'attractive evil character'. Because the supervising designer created a rough design that fit the desired appearance to a 'T', little was changed for this character's design. Incidentally, the team story quotes casually from Robert Browning's 'Spring Song', but no one on the staff took interest in this (Boo hoo). And the bit about Shanghai Crabs was the original material for the character 'Rojin'.[CR]About Duo Long : When speaking of the Flying Brigands, you have quite a collection of especially unique-looking characters, but Duo Long is, unlike those of his ilk so far, an orthodox, handsome character. The model for this character is a certain Romanian vampire and hunter with the same first letter for his name. A subtly embroidered dragon is depicted on the back of Duo Lon's costume, but according to the illustration's supervising designer Falcoon, this character sports a detailed character that follows the steady work of traditional craftsmen with the scales drawn one at a time...[CR]About Shen Woo : The first concept for this character was a wild and sexy guy. The development codename for him was ''The Third Man'', and along those lines he became Woo Shen, his name 'flip-flopping' to the current name, and the latter moniker seemed to stick. Because Ash has his particular appearance (LAUGH), Shen, no matter how you look at it, appears more like the main character. His character closely resembles certain aspects of Ralf and Yashiro in many ways, so designers toiled to create distinctive moves for this character. According to the supervising designer, 'What knotted my stomach most was the shortness of time we had for development'.[CR]About Tizoc : To tell the truth, Raiden was to appear in KOF 2003, but before the characters were finally decided on, Tizoc took his place. Along with the change to KOF 2003's game system, designers were able to create movements heretofore impossible with KOF until now, allowing us to add the style of Tizoc for that very reason. It's unclear whether there were plans or not to introduce Grant from "Garou - Mark of the Wolves" along with Tizoc for a friendly tag team battle. It may not be very well known, but the Japanese name for Tizoc is 'Griffon Mask'. But we felt Tizoc for the English version had a nice ring to it.[CR]About Gato : Keeping the demands of the Chinese market in mind, designers included a user of orthodox Chinese boxing in the game to follow our marketing plans and enter the battle with Tizoc from "Garou - Mark of the Wolves". Halfway through the development process, he became the character that was busy getting burned, frozen, and slapped around with a giant metal ball by other characters to experiment with the overhauled program. When Gato appeared, many groundless rumors circulated that 'Hotaru had made a comeback' and other such rumors to the same. Whatever command you enter, be aware that Hotaru Futaba is nowhere to be found in KOF 2003, and Gato is here to stay![CR]About Malin : KOF 2003 saw the absence of Choi Bounge, so why not make a nimble and cute girl character?! And with that sentiment, Malin was born. It took quite an effort to arrive at the initial design for this character, but when we entered the actual work for KOF 2003, the creation of this character was a piece of cake. In the appearance sequence, the supervising designer poured his sincerity into the transformation scene. But the Arcadia magazine realized that she wasn't included in their feature articles and regretted their mistake. If you consider our preferences, designers insisted on the spelling for this character to be 'Malin' and not 'Marin'. This is the humble preference of the supervising designer and a mystery to us all.[CR]About Maki Kagura : If the younger sister Chizuru Kagura is the stork, the elder sister Maki Kagura's name comes from the tortoise (storks live a thousand years, but tortoises live 10,000). The background story for these two twins comes from KOF '96, but with their appearance in KOF 2003, some designers suggested Maki's hair be shortened to distinguish her from her kid sister. She appears in KOF 2003 as she always does (Her bangs are slightly different, however, so people who have confidence in their powers of observation, beware!). For the location test of KOF 2003, many players who defeated Chizuru were vanquished by the awesome elder sister Maki. So the fate of players was often decided with the appearance of Maki-you just don't mess around with this character![CR]About Adelheid : To widen the worldview of KOF with the desire to add a separate story to the main tale, designers added this character devised as a set with her kid sister Rose. Designers think many picked up on this, but Adelheid is a common female name among Swiss and Germans, and is the name from which the diminutive of Heidi's derives. In the Adelheid stage of KOF 2003, the soundtrack begins with Chopin's 'Revolutionary Etude', but including something like this on the NEO-GEO system required a huge amount of memory which overwhelmed the voice data of other characters. Designers believe it was worth it, but producers may have dissed the supervising designers of other characters in the process.[CR]About Rose : If Hinako was the modern, unconventional 'na?f', Rose is the classic 'sophisticate' character. She has an overpowering sense of pride and high-handedness. She's also selfish and moody. If things don't go her way, watch out! But she's a real babe and not only that, she's rich! (Laugh). The voice actor for Rose also worked on Malin and Maki Kagura. Because she had a tough schedule providing the voice for three characters in one day, she was really put through a tough trial. The staff regrets this and gives their thanks from the bottom of the ocean.[CR]About Mukai : With the belief that a fighting game boss 'must be easy to understand', designers adopted the 'ability to fossilize' to give impact to Mukai's presence. Designers then matched the design of this character to this ability. So as far as the procedure of development is concerned, Mukai was quite an unorthodox creation. The concept and design came off without a hitch, but arriving at his name was a difficult process. He's among the first of the KOF series boss characters who would be graced with the Japanese honorific of '-san'.[CR]Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.[CR]Scitron Digital Content released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters 2003 Original Sound Trax - SCDC-00337) on 24/04/2004.[CR]Hacks of this game are known as :[CR]"The King of Fighters 2004 Plus".[CR]"The King of Fighters 2004 Ultra Plus".[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Evil Kusanagi : Hold Down, then rotate control stick clockwise to Upleft then rotate counter-clockwise to Upright, then press any button.[CR]* Play as Chizuru and Maki : Hold Up, then rotate control stick counter-clockwise to Upright then rotate clockwise to Downleft, then press any button.[CR]* Final Bosses : To fight Adelheid, defeat Kusanagi (the mid-boss) without using a Desperation Move as your final hit that KOs him. To fight Chizuru/Maki followed by Mukai, defeat Kusanagi (the mid-boss) using a Desperation Move as your final hit that KOs him.[CR]* Endings : There are different endings for beating either Adelheid or Mukai. You can also see an extended ending for a non-Team-Edit team when you beat Mukai.

			<plot>The King of Fighters '94 (c) 1994 SNK.[CR]24 selectable characters in fixed teams of three clash to defeat Rugal Bernstein.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-055[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player.[CR][JOYSTICK] 8-way, [A] Light punch, [B] Light kick, [C] Strong punch, [D] Strong kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in August 1994.[CR]The King of Fighters (or KOF for short) revolutionized the fighter genre with the introduction of 3 member team fighting called the 'team battle system', and by combining elements of two of SNK's existing fighting game in "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" and "Art of Fighting", as well as bringing back characters from games predating the MVS in "Ikari Warriors" and "Psycho Soldier". A new game in the series is produced every year.[CR]At the demo previous to the first Rugal encounter, Rugal shows your team the statues he has gathered by turning his opponents into them. One of the statues is of a guy that looks a lot like Capcom's Guile making a Sonic Boom. Capcom later confirmed that it was indeed Guile's statue in "Capcom Vs. SNK - Millenium Fight 2000". When Guile fights Rugal that statue is shown and later destroyed by Guile.[CR]Kyo Kusanagi : Since Kyo was created as a snazzy character capable of holding his own against the main characters of "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" and "Art of Fighting", coming up with the right design was quite a lengthy undertaking. Kyo's personality remained a mystery until the final stages of development. Originally, he was to be called 'Sho Kirishima', but during the latter stages of development, his designers decided on the name of Kyo Kusanagi, and Sho got a rapid name change. The setting for the Orochi Saga, in which we learn that Kyo's ancestors defeated the Orochi of the Yamata, began with this game.[CR]Benimaru Nikaido : This character was loosely based on a comic book character (Jean-Pierre Polnaref from "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure"), and even after the name of Benimaru was decided on, game developers gave the poor guy an identity crisis by continuing to call him by the comic book character's name. The voice for this character, too, had a peculiar bent to it, and when Benimaru's designer heard his creation's victory line of 'Thank you' recited for the first time, rumor has it that he couldn't work for days after : the reading had nothing to do with the character's original image. His speech patterns have led some to question Benimaru's preferences as far as certain lifestyles are concerned.[CR]Goro Daimon : This character comes from the designers' desire to create a judo athlete who uses dynamic body tosses. His initial designs incurred the criticism of some fellow designers who were of the opinion that it was just plain loopy for Daimon to fight wearing Japanese geta (wooden clogs), but Goro's creators were adamant and he kept his footwear. The suggestions for his laconic victory lines and the sound of an explosion when Goro is victorious also stuck.[CR]Terry Bogard : When the concept for KOF was first formulated, Terry was tacked on to the roster as an afterthought, but his popularity skyrocketed! He became the character who got the designers' utmost attention, and they fretted over various aspects of his character. In the first KOF, Terry became the powerhouse, getting a super punch cancel move added to his arsenal and becoming the fearsome character he is today.[CR]Andy Bogard : Compared to Andy's original form ("Fatal Fury - King of Fighters"), Andy changed little in his move to KOF, but what he got in return was the addition of his Ultra Disruptor move to his arsenal of moves. When first added, it boasted overwhelming power : it was easy to use, never missed, trumped other moves, and annihilated all opponents.[CR]Joe Higashi : Joe is a character who underwent a major image makeover from his transition from "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters". The victory pose of KOF '94 initially lacked the toothy smile we're familiar with now. It was quite a thorn in the side that we felt inappropriate for Joe's legion of fans. So, in rethinking the original design, we added the pearly whites that makes Joe to loveable character he is today.[CR]Ryo Sakazaki : Ryo (as can be said of all characters from "Art of Fighting") has so many Special Moves that it seems almost unfair to the other characters, and in the designing stage, the Art of Fighting team tended to be the strongest. The designers focused on adjusting this imbalance without taking out any moves, but in the end Ryo and his team remain the toughest competitors.[CR]Robert Garcia : Overall, KOF's characters are fit and trim, but compared to their original concepts, Robert is the slimmest of them all. Matched up against Kensou, he chide his adversary in Japanese with an Osaka accent, allowing players to enjoy the amusing word play that Osaka comedians are known for.[CR]Takuma Sakazaki : Since the Takuma of "Art of Fighting 2" closely resembled Daimon, he received a karate tunic in his ensemble to set him apart and that's why he looks the way he does today. He originally had a combo attack after the 'Super Shrike Gale' move that appeared to be a glitch. Hence, during game development, this move was taken out, but the game designers thought that he just wasn't Takuma without this move and it was put back in. The designers slightly regret their decision because Takuma's become quite a mean little bugger as a result.[CR]Yuri Sakazaki : Yuri is a disciple of Kyokugen Karate but her appearances in the KOF series are frequently as a member of the women fighters' team. Originally in KOF '94 there was no such team and production began on King Billy Big Bear as the English team. But "Art of Fighting 2" was completed at that time and the designers pressed to put Yuri into KOF, replacing her with Big Bear, who was presenting various problems, for various reasons (hah, hah) concerning capacity. Enter Yuri, goodbye Billy! (A tragedy, we know) And so the originally planned team started life anew as the mighty women fighters' team.[CR]Heidern : Heidern was devised as a cold-blooded killing machine when he first saw digital life, but as the KOF story unfolded, Heidern's designer identified with the character and provided him with a tragic past. When his super special moves were completed, the moves were so wild that game designers worried that he would have to be depicted as a sorcerer or an alien in order to explain his dazzling moves.[CR]Ralf Jones : In the first stages of Ralf's development, he appeared shirtless to truly express the feeling of ikari or rage, but during the designing phase, someone felt his look was a bit dated and Ralf got the apparel he's now known and loved for. He originally had special moves that allowed him to use grenades, setting him apart from other team members, and a distinctive design, but his use of grenades in a fighting competition was deemed a bit unfair, so he lost that particular talent.[CR]Clark Steel : At the beginning of development, the only differences in designs for Ralf and Clark was one had a hat and the other had a bandanna, but Clark later got a pair of sunglasses to become the character he is today. Clark basically looks a lot like Ralf, but since the designer in charge of adjusting this character worked on his hit accuracy, action speed and attack strength, their combat style is where the true differences between the two can be found.[CR]Athena Asamiya : Given that Athena is always the most highly anticipated character of the series, the pressure to keep her on the roster at any cost is pretty overwhelming. And because SNK staff focuses so much on her, SNK have been accused of favoritism. Japanese fans asked SNK to dress her in a sailor blouse and skirt, but we scrubbed that idea because SNK felt it wouldn't translate overseas and be a bit too risque. But SNK made up for that omission with her wild entrance actions (Hubba! Hubba!).[CR]Sie Kensou : Compared with Athena, Kensou's design has been a bit slapdash. In the previous title, Athena stole the show and since we felt Kensou was a bit too overshadowed by her, SNK gave him a radically new look to appeal to our female fans. We're often asked about Kensou's use of Japanese with an Osaka accent in the game, but he's always done that since his Psycho Soldier days. In other words, he's been doing it far longer than Robert has.[CR]Chin Gentsai : When SNK first decided to try our hands at a fighting game, SNK felt we just had to have a geezer who used the Drunken Fist form of martial arts. Getting the OK, SNK introduced this character as Athena's teacher. As we aimed to create a genuine Drunken Fist master, SNK thought it would be hard to get the right touch, but since designer was good at drawing old guys, the finished product far exceeded original expectations. Unfortunately for the designer, he was unable to shake this habit and all of his subsequent characters tended to look like spry old men.[CR]Mai Shiranui : Regarding Mai's familiar pause action... One day, the designer for Mai asked if it was all right to increase Mai's pause actions, and because the powers that be thought there was enough remaining memory for the game (actually there wasn't) they said, 'Go for it'. When the completed pose was presented, it knocked people flat. Due to this pose's potency, however, Mai's eye-popping motions were stilled in the KOF '94 international home version.[CR]King : As far as King's super special moves go, there were various reasons why the 'Surprise Rose' was initially scheduled to be scrapped. Just when the development staff was worrying about coming up with a move that was something different, though, King's designer whipped this move up, it was well received, and it became her super special move, with no alterations needed.[CR]Heavy D! : Since there has been a number of boxers in fighting games, Heavy D! was designed with the intent to create a different type of pugilist. When he first appeared on the drawing board, D! was not intended to be that big a character, but as he evolved and stood among the other characters it became apparent that he was one huge dude. ...Due to certain production circumstances, however, D! kept his imposing stature and came to be the character he is today.[CR]Lucky Glauber : Known as the basketball fighter, Lucky's original image was based on the character appearing in the Bruce Lee movie, 'Game of Death'. Though originally created with that image in mind, his first design was deemed too plain and he then received his current look. His ability to use karate, though, is a remnant of his original conception.[CR]Brian Battler : Brian came into being well before the KOF project came down the pike, and he's one of the oldest characters. He originally wore a helmet and chest pad, but he shed that equipment to arrive at his current design.[CR]Kim Kaphwan : At first, the duo of Chang and Choi were set to team with another vicious criminal to form the Fugitive Team, but due to certain circumstances the third criminal was replaced with Kim and the familiar team came into being. The addition of Kim was considered somewhat forced, however, so Kim received the mission of rehabilitating the two.[CR]Chang Koehan : Chang was originally far more violent than he is today, but once he teamed up with Kim, he became mellowed a bit. Chang's super special move, the Wild Ball, was originally designed as a test move, but it got such a good response that it was put into the game without alteration. This move is a pastiche of Kim's Phoenix Kick.[CR]Choi Bounce : Choi is KOF's mighty novelty character. His original design looked way too much like a certain someone, so he was hastily given a new look a month before the final character designs had to be completed, giving Choi's designers one major headache. The first time Choi displayed his attacking and retreating moves and rolled around the screen, he revealed not only his fighting abilities but his talent for physical comedy.[CR]An interesting thing about Chang and Choi : Chang was the tallest and heaviest KOF character, while Choi was the lightest and shortest. The duo is very popular in Japan, but hated by American fans. Because of their size differences, they have made a (quite) comedic couple, making the Korean team (or the Kim team) the comedy-relief team of KOF.[CR]Rugal Bernstein : The concept for this character at the time was to make the mightiest (most violent) and most evil boss character ever. As everyone knows, Rugal is the King of Bosses who boasts the most appearances in the KOF series as a boss character, but even considering the whole genre known as 'competitive fighting games', his story and moves have changed ever so gradually while appearing in so many titles, he's one of the few bosses to have been loved (heh, heh) over such a long period.[CR]Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.[CR]Brazil Stage's background music (Jungle Bouncer) samples "Surprise! You're Dead!", a song from Faith No More.[CR]The background music from USA Stage (Slum No. 5), Japan Stage (Esaka) and the 2nd Rugal Stage (Showdown R &amp; D) all contain voice samples from "Gutfest '89", a song from Digital Underground.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '94 - PCCB-00162) on 21/10/1994.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Select Victory Pose : Press a Punch or Kick button immediately after winning a match.[CR]* Critical Hit Oddity : A critical hit is an attack done at the opponent while he/she is attacking. In this game there is a bug that enables either the CPU or the player to take out insane amounts of damage if this is done right. An easy-to-do example is to counter Kim's Hisho-Kyaku with Heidern's Moon Cutter (you must hit Kim's legs with Heidern's hand), if done right you'll take 80-90% off Kim's life-bar in one hit! Try it with other characters and be amazed (This does not work in any other game in the KOF series, though!). :)[CR]* Beat the game without continuing to see all the characters grouped together on the The End screen.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

			<plot>The King of Fighters '95 (c) 1995 SNK.[CR]8 teams comprised of 3 characters each square off again to take out Rugal Bernstein.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-084[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player.[CR][JOYSTICK] 8-way, [A] Weak punch, [B] Weak kick, [C] Strong punch, [D] Strong kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in July 1995.[CR]The background for the Japan Team is, in fact, a real place.[CR]Yuri's Chou Upper is very similar to Sakura's own Shou'ou Ken.[CR]Iori Yagami : Since the KOF '95 project began with the concept of introducing Iori as Kyo's rival, he became known as a character who was a member of a rival school of martial arts that had a connection to the Ancient Arts of the Kusanagi. He was also given the ability to use a different color of flames other than Kyo's (red flames), along with various other characteristics. When you think of Iori Yagami, his intense personality most likely comes to mind. His moves are unique, and his singular choice of hairstyle, wardrobe, and manner of speaking was certainly a personality that broke the mold for characters in fighting games at that time. During the initial location tests to determine the popularity of the game, Iori was the character who stood out most. His hair and his lines to provoke his opponents ('You think I'm scary, do you?') excited his fans to no end. What set him apart are his memorable lines: 'You cry! You scream! Then you die!', 'Think of me when you gaze at the moon', and a whole catalog of others too numerous to list here.[CR]Billy Kane : Along with Eiji, Billy appears as Iori's 'teammate' (ha, ha) in KOF'95. With the three rivals to the heroes coincidentally appearing on a single team, the name of the 'Rival Team' was decided upon as an afterthought. But since we couldn't wait for the rest of the world to get used to that concept and given the insanity of Iori, the team had to disband after their single appearance in KOF'95. As memory serves, the designers for this team were so motivated to create this team that their finished product was quite impressive. As a matter of fact, the voice actors worked like busy beavers to give the characters their lines. These characters were portrayed by Mr. Namase in '95, Mr. Yamanishi in '97, '98 and '02 and Seijiro in '03.[CR]Omega Rugal : After apparently dying in KOF '94, Rugal's resurrection in KOF '95 turned him, convincingly enough, into a cyborg (prosthetic arms) armed (pardon the pun) with the power of the Orochi. In the subsequent titles of KOF '98 and KOF 2002, Rugal was brought back not once but twice to conclude story-lines. Why? "He's the only character who truly represents the ultimate KOF boss". Among these, Omega Rugal from KOF '98 was the most powerful and had the flashiest moves, so he's one of our personal favorite boss characters of the series.[CR]Saisyu Kusanagi : His first appearance was, of course, in KOF '94, but his presence in KOF '95 was never planned (because he was supposed to have died in '94). During the final stages of KOF '95, he suddenly was inserted as a mid-level boss. That's who Saisyu Kusanagi is. Given that spur of the moment appearance, it's quite unexpected that he's still a very popular character? no offense to him, mind you. During location tests for the game, not one of his fans read the Chinese characters for his name as 'Saisyu', and he came to be known as 'Shibafune'.[CR]Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '95 - PCCB-00187) on 19/08/1995.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Rugal and Saisyu Kusanagi : At the team edit screen, the 15 second counter, press and hold Start. While holding start, push Up+B, Right+C, Left+A and Down+D. The two bosses should then appear on either side of the counter and the counter should reset back to 15.[CR]* Select Victory Pose : Press a Punch or Kick button immediately after winning a match.[CR]* Beat the game on Hard or MVS mode without continuing to see a collage of all the teams after the credits.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

His basic moves, however, remained unchanged.[CR]Yuri's Yuri Chou Mawashi Geri is a knock-off of Ryu's Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku.[CR]If you look at the game code for this game, you would have seen more moves that were originally planned for this game, but never made the cut (for some characters, these moves debuted in later games).[CR]Among those moves that were cut were Kyo's Saishuu Kessen Ougi 'Mu Shiki', Daimon's Arashi no Yama, Robert's Muei Senpuu Juudan Kyaku, Ralf's Umanori Vulcan Punch, Clark's Running Three, Geese's Deadly Rave and Choi's Hou'ou Kyaku.[CR]Geese's music (Geese ni Katakori) is a remixed version of his Fatal Fury 1 theme music (Geese ni Kiss).[CR]A remixed version of Big Shot! (originally Terry's theme music in "Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory") was used as the Fatal Fury Team's music.[CR]About Leona : Along with the extensive overhaul to the team lineup of KOF '96, Leona entered the series as a replacement for Heidern, leader of the Ikari Team. Introducing the plot element of Heidern's adopted daughter had been dreamed up by the game designers before the production of KOF '96, and the details surrounding her origins gradually came to include a crucial role as a descendant of the Orochi tribe. Designed with the ardent love of her designers, Leona's special moves are markedly unique compared to the other characters, and reveal the particular tastes of her designers.[CR]About Mature : She used to be Rugal's secretary. For the chief game planner at the time, it seems that both she and Vice were given the image of the 'ruthless woman' and the 'cruel woman' respectively, but when they became actual characters things got a little hectic, and someone came up with, 'Rugal had a secretary, didn't he. Make it two and run with that'. So these two characters came into being (Talk about slacking off). Consequently, they received additional characteristics : they were actually spies sent to observe Rugal and the descendants of the Orochi 8ketsu Clan.[CR]About Vice : If Mature was the 'ruthless woman', Vice was to be the 'cruel woman'. The official illustrations for Vice and Mature remain extremely popular, and we're glad we could supply our fans with these images that cannot be reduced to pixels. The period of development for KOF '96 dragged on right up to the time of its scheduled release. At the location test for this title, Mature and Vice were still not included in the game. It's not that they were hidden, but there wasn't enough time to insert them into this initial version (we can talk about this calmly now, but at the time...forget about it!).[CR]About Goenitz : In spite of the fact of Goenitz's sole official appearance in '96, he continues to have a considerable following of fans to this day, making him one of KOF's most popular characters. With strength that surpasses Rugal, the boss character of '94 and '95, the episode of the young Goenitz taking out the eye of Rugal was added to the game's story. Rugal, in turn, relieved Heidern of one of his eyes, which makes us think that SNK sure seems to have a lot of one-eyed characters, witness Gilbert, Jubei Yagyu, and Ramon. If you look carefully at the Goenitz the designer drew at the time (with a little help), you'll notice the shiver-inducing moment in which Goenitz appears to have six fingers.[CR]About Geese Howard : The dream event for SNK's most recognizable characters! ...and what dream event would be complete without the appearance of Geese? Naturally, he's the character who people hope appears in the game each year, and there were plans to have him appear in KOF '95 long before. Various considerations at the time, however, led developers to abandon this plan. Then, with the time being ripe, Geese reappeared in KOF '96. Even throughout the game, this boss team received special treatment : things like leitmotif music were prepared for each member and at the time of this title's release, enthusiasm for this game reached a feverish pitch. Numerous special moves were prepared for Geese, but in view of the memory capacity and time required for adjustments, a good number of Super Special Moves had to be left out. A waste, really...[CR]About Wolfgang Krauser : In KOF '96 the Boss Team was formed! And with that, Krauser entered the tournament, teaming up with his half brother Geese... but at the time, in terms of memory limitations and the KOF system of that time, it was a tough environment to faithfully depict the Krauser of Fatal Fury. Developers still cringe remembering the numerous criticisms, big and small, regarding the Fatal Fury Team's treatment. KOF '96 saw the debut of Krauser as a player character, but in the ending sequence he did make a cameo in KOF '94.[CR]About Mr. BIG : For a variety of reasons, the Krauser of KOF got a bad rap, but BIG received favorable reviews from the fans. BIG is an austere villain brimming over with adult appeal-that's the character of Mr. BIG. The behavior of the women who hang with him also is based on a certain video the designers of the time often watched. The woman mutters, "He's bad", but just what does that actually mean? The truth remains a deep mystery. During the development stage, a positive slide for his Super Special Moves included one labeled "Spinning Stick Thrust, Kind of Like an Anti-Air Assault". We'd like to think that the move wasn't scrapped because of the vagueness of its name, but it's too bad the general public never got to see it. It rocks![CR]Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '96 - PCCB-00223) on 21/08/1996.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Alternate costume colors : press D when selecting a fighter on the character selection screen.[CR]* Select victory pose : press a Punch or Kick button immediately after winning a match.[CR]* Finish the game using one of these combinations to see the special endings :[CR]1) Chizuru, Kyo, Iori[CR]2) Goenitz, and 2 more characters except Chizuru[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

			<plot>The King of Fighters '97 (c) 1997 SNK.[CR]9 teams of 3 and 2 solo entries pump the number of selectable characters up to 29 in a battle to defeat the evil Orochi and those infected with his blood.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-232[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player.[CR][JOYSTICK] 8-way, [A] Weak punch, [B] Weak kick, [C] Strong punch, [D] Strong kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in July 1997.[CR]Yuri has a long record of taking movements from other characters, especially Capcom (see previous KOF entries). In this new opus : Yuri's new special attack 'Hien Rekkou' is a knock off of Ken's Shoryuu Reppa.[CR]Roddy and Cathy from "Top Hunter - Roddy &amp; Cathy" appear in the Kowloon background at the extreme left.[CR]Other characters appearing in the Kowloon stage are : Roddy Birts and Lenny Creston from "Art of Fighting 3 - The Path of the Warrior".[CR]The American Sports team from "The King of Fighters '94".[CR]Lee Pai Long, Tung Fu Rue and Jubei Yamada from "Art of Fighting" and "Fatal Fury Special" and King's Waitresses with Rugal's panther.[CR]The Terry's theme music was originally from "Real Bout Fatal Fury Special".[CR]The Ryuji Yamazaki and Mary's Blues theme music was originally from "Real Bout Fatal Fury Special".[CR]The Athena Asamiya thene music come from "Psycho Soldier".[CR]The name of the 3 characters instrumental in the defeat of Orochi have some relation to the original legend :[CR]1) Kyo Kusanagi : The Kusanagi is the name of the sword that was used to kill the Great Serpent.[CR]2) Iori Yagami : One of his moves, the Ya Sakazuki, means '8 wine cups', which were needed to get the Great Serpent drunk.[CR]3) Chizuru Kagura : She was the last surviving member of the Yata clan and the mirror used to seal Orochi away was a homage to the mirror in the legend (in the legend, it was a mirror created by the Great Serpent's tears).[CR]In this iteration of KOF and the following games where he is a playable character, Choi Bounge gains a special throw (using the D button) where he pokes his claws up the opponents rear, this is actually supposed to be a Japanese prank, but the pranksters do not use claws.[CR]About Ryuji Yamazaki : To bring the story that had grown too large and out of control back on track, the members of the Orochi 8ketsu Clan were teamed up in '97. By doing this, the dev. team thought, the story would reach its conclusion for the time being... but among the 3 new faces including Leona's father Gaidell, the dev. team lacked one more member for the 8ketsu. What should we do?... And along came Ryuji Yamazaki to bail us out of our predicament. A snake charmer that even looked like a snake, he became a popular villain. He once humbled himself, joined up with the Fatal Fury team, and blended into the world of KOF more than we had predicted. The game planner at that time really knocked himself out to provide new moves for Yamazaki. Idea after idea got a short trip to the circular file (Attract opponent after Snake Charmer move; Seven Serpent Dagger Throw, etc.), and those failures led to successful moves like the Sand Sweeper.[CR]About Blue Mary : Receiving the strong support of fans in a magazine's popularity poll, Blue Mary made her name known to the public, appearing in KOF from '97. Losing to Blue Mary in the popularity contest, as a matter of fact, was Duck King. This popularity contest truly decided the fate of these 2. From '97 to '03, Mary became a regular to the series for the staff. Duck, on the other hand, hit the skids, and he was relegated to cameos at the side of screens, in backgrounds, or as a Striker character. Doesn't this fleeting episode make you think about the impermanence of everything? Since the designer in charge of Mary preferred her outfit in "Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory", she's kept that look until now. It seems to have worked.[CR]About Yashiro Nanakase : Yashiro's team was created to offset the remaining top 3 characters. With the combination of their use of 3 elements-Kyo and Chris representing fire, Benimaru and Shermie signifying lightning, and Daimon and Yashiro standing in for the earth-the concept for Yashiro and his cohorts as rivals to the series' heroes was further emphasized. It also explains the battle of hairstyles (and bands, too) between Yashiro and Iori. In consideration to events going on in the world today, designers have expiated some of Yashiro's more wicked ending lines-such as, 'Execution, accomplished.'-and tossed them into the dustbin of game history. Incidentally, some of the production codes for his Super Special Move commands consisted of moves like the '260 Million Slams'. Some of his dumped moves included 'Human Surfing'.[CR]About Shermie : Shermie is a glamorous girl who works as a fashion designer and plays in a band as a hobby. But in fact she is one of the 4 Orochi leaders who's adept at body slams. Come to think of it, she's quite an enigmatic character. The material for Shermie the 'Raging Lightning Flash' comes from L the Third. And even more trivia : the character of Yashiro comes from Bl.. G... Xa..gle and the character of Chris is derived from A.T. V...ms. The design for Shermie was easily decided on. Given her long bangs that will absolutely never reveal her eyes, she was called Tesse from "Waku Waku 7" at one time. Her hidden eyes burn with a homicidal glare it is said, but there's no material that reveals what her face actually looks like.[CR]About Chris : Chris can kill with an innocent smile on his face-kind of a creepy personality trait, come to think of it (but he looks so cute, doesn't he?). To pull things together and bring the story concerning the leaders of the Orochi and the 8-ketsu clan to its climax once and for all in '97, a lot of story elements were forced onto Chris who became the vessel fort the Orochi (this actually began from the early stages of production). And there's a story behind Chris's Super Special Move line, 'Ripping the chrysalis, the butterfly flutters'.[CR]About Orochi : At first, designers planned a rather extreme setting in which a buck-naked Chris battled with a glowing energy ball, but for better or worse went with the current design (A survey of the designers garnered a mere 2 votes for the design for a buck-naked Chris). Incidentally, his design codename was 'Chief'. A lot of people were against the name 'Orochi', too, but these days it has become a firmly established proper noun in gaming lingo.[CR]About Orochi Iori : The powers that be, who created the stories for the boss characters to heat things up for the series with KOF '97, first decided to make the final boss an Orochi to conclude the series' "Orochi Saga". The stage bosses were an easy choice : the 3 remaining characters of the Four Orochi Deities. This was followed with the suggestion to make the final boss Iori, 'berserk with the Orochi blood rage'. So the 'Minor', 'Middle', and 'Major' bosses were decided, with the 'Orochi Iori' we know and love rounding off the quartet as the final boss. Because this character was originally designed as a player character at the time, he's designed to mow down the other characters with relative ease.[CR]About Orochi Leona : If Iori appeared berserk with the Orochi blood, the other successor in the bloodline of the 8-ketsu Clan, Leona, was also destined to go berserk someday. That's how this character came about. But inexplicably the design team wanted to heat up battles against the computer. So various sequences such as televised broadcasts were added, and provided a turn of nail-biting events that sent players to a 'fork in the game' that would pit them up against either Orochi Iori or Orochi Leona in the end. But savvy players who knew how to get a character to appear would be able to select their particular routes.[CR]About Kyo Kusanagi Version '94 : Along with KOF '96 game system changes, Kyo got a new arsenal of different Special Moves, and the wielder of the 'Dark Thrust' was as popular as ever. And designers also added the KOF '94 version of Kyo Kusanagi to satisfy all our fans. Designers were apprehensive about returning to the old character design, but this all disappeared with the warm acceptance of fans.[CR]About Shingo Yabuki : : The code name for this character in the early stages was 'Shingo Suzuki'. The plainness of his name conversely suited Shingo quite well, we thought, but what do you think ? He was originally based on Kyo with the concept of becoming a comic, everyday guy foil, but in spite of our intention to promote him simply and plainly, he was splashed all over the place and his silhouette appeared in pre-promotion campaigns in magazines, becoming an extensively hyped character. And his voice was supplied by the famous Japanese voice actor Taketo Koyasu. And one more thing, Shingo is a character who can't shoot flames. And probably never will.[CR]The dialogue heard during the Title Screen music (4th Fire) goes as follows:[CR]"They're back to the heat... For the answer they've long been searching for.[CR]Is it their fate, or just a bloody coincidence? It shall be clear, as three powers will be as one...[CR]Now, the fourth phase is about to begin![CR]The King of Fighters '97.[CR]The story moves towards its violent destiny."[CR]A hack of this game is known as "The King of Fighters '97 Plus" and allows you to play evil versions of Leona, Iori and the Orochi team plus Orochi himself.[CR]Another hack is known as "King of Gladiator".[CR]Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'. [CR]Pony Canyon released a 2 CD limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '97 - PCCB-00273) on 20/08/1997.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as KOF94 style Kyo Kusanagi : highlight Kyo, hold START and press any button.[CR]* Play as Orochi Iori : at the character select screen, highlight Iori, then hold Start and press Left, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right, Left, Right, A+C.[CR]* Play as Orochi Leona : at the character select screen, highlight Leona, then hold Start and press Up, Down, Up, Down, Up, Down, Up, Down, Up, Down, B+D.[CR]* Play as Orochi New Team : enter the Orochi Leona code, then return to the character section screen, hold Start and press Up, Left, Down, Right, Up, Down, B+C.[CR]* Select victory pose : press a Punch or Kick button immediately after winning a match.[CR]* Preview Power Ase : hold Start while choosing your fighter order and a face will appear over each person.

			<plot>The King of Fighters '98 - The Slugfest (c) 1998 SNK.[CR]A special edition of the KoF series taking place outside of the established storyline with a whopping 38 selectable KoF alumni.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-242[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player.[CR][JOYSTICK] 8-way, [A] Weak punch, [B] Weak kick, [C] Strong punch, [D] Strong kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in July 1998.[CR]This game is known in Japan as "The King of Fighters '98 - Dream Match Never Ends".[CR]It is said that this game is a 'dream match' for more reasons than one - this KOF is said to exist only in Shingo's dream - each character in this dream match was Shingo's impression of these characters, based on either personal experience or his notes in his notebook.[CR]Yuri has a long record of taking movements from other characters, especially Capcom (see previous KOF entries). In this new opus : Yuri's new special attack 'Shin! Chou Upper' is a knock off of Ryu's Shin Shoryuu Ken. She also has a movement similar to Terry's burn knuckle. Finally, her Forward+A is a parody of Sakura's Flower Kick.[CR]KOF98 contains pieces of music from older KOFs.[CR]For example, the character select music when a second player joins in is straight from KOF 96 (it's called Roulette).[CR]Here's a complete list of themes, the teams (or individuals) they belong to and the games they were taken from :[CR]Esaka? (Japan Team) : KOF 96 (Japan Team's theme music).[CR]Esaka (95-style Kyo Kusanagi) : KOF 94 (Japan Team's theme music).[CR]Kurikinton (Fatal Fury Team) : Fatal Fury 2 (Terry Bogard's theme music).[CR]Art of Fight (Art of Fighting Team) : Art of Fighting (Ryo Sakazaki's and Ryuhaku Todo's theme music).[CR]Rumbling in the City (Ikari Team) : KOF 96 (Ikari Team's theme music).[CR]Shin! Senritsu no Dora (Psycho Soldier Team) : KOF95 (Psycho Soldier Team's theme music).[CR]Fairy (Gals Fighters Team) : KOF 96 (Chizuru Kagura's theme music).[CR]Seoul Town (Korea Team) : Real Bout Fatal Fury (Kim Kaphwan's theme music).[CR]Bloody (New Face Team) : KOF 97 (New Face Team's theme music).[CR]Rhythmic Hallucination (Orochi Yashiro) : KOF 97 (Orochi New Face Team's theme music).[CR]C62 (Ryuji Yamazaki) : Real Bout Fatal Fury Special (Ryuji Yamazaki's theme music).[CR]Blue Mary's Blues (Blue Mary) : Real Bout Fatal Fury Special (Blue Mary's theme music).[CR]London March (Billy Kane) : Real Bout Fatal Fury Special (Billy Kane's theme music).[CR]Arashi no Saxophone (Iori Yagami) : KOF 95 (Revenge Team's theme music).[CR]Arashi no Saxophone 2 (Mature, Vice) : KOF 96 (Iori Team's theme music).[CR]Slum No. 5 (USA Sports Team) : KOF 94 (USA Sports Team's theme music).[CR]Still Green (Shingo Yabuki) : KOF 97 (Shingo Yabuki's theme music).[CR]Ketchaku R&amp;D (Omega Rugal) : first half from KOF 94 (Rugal Bernstein's theme music), second half from KOF 95 (Omega Rugal's theme music).[CR]Ne! ('94 Gals Fighters Team) : KOF 94 (Gals Fighters Team's theme music).[CR]Also to note that the music that is played prior to facing Rugal (Kettou R&amp;D) is also from KOF 94 (as the theme for Rugal's first form).[CR]When Choi Bounge appears, a 7 seconds sample from a song is played. This song is 'Choi Bounge Ondo', which appeared in the KOF 97 Arrange SoundTracks. The song became quite popular in Japan.[CR]Mr. Big from "Art of Fighting" makes a small cameo appearance in the USA Wharf background, during the first rounds.[CR]About Kyo Version 95 : Because the introduction of different versions for this character included as "hidden features" in KOF '97 was such a hit with fans, designers thought, another version of Kyo in KOF '98 would make the game more inviting. Designers also remember that both versions for Kyo Kusanagi for game tests were equally popular. This concept for different versions of this character subsequently became the basis for the 'Kyo clones'.[CR]In the Japan Street stage, during the second round if you look in the middle of the background where some shops are, you can see tiny moving people who look like Iori, Mai and Terry Bogard. In the third and fifth round, you can see two people doing hand signals, they look similar to Kyo Kusanagi &amp; Shingo Yabuki. In the fourth round, you can see Mai and Terry.[CR]A serious bug : Using a USA bios rom if you insert a coin on the 'winners don't use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neo+geo bios s1 tile-set rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the main-board z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attact loop after game over, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.[CR]Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.[CR]Soundtrack releases:[CR][JP] Aug. 19, 1998; The King of Fighters '98 - Dream Match Never Ends [PCCB-00334] - Pony Canyon.[CR][JP] Sep. 18, 1998; The King of Fighters '98 - Dream Match Never Ends Arrange Sound Trax [PCCB-00337] - Pony Canyon.[CR](JP] Oct. 07, 1998; The King of Fighters '98 - Dream Match Never Ends Drama CD [PCCB-00339] - Pony Canyon.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]At the Intro music (CIPHER) and the Staff Roll BGM (ZERO) a sample used says 'mot*er fu**er'. Apparently, this sample was removed in some non-Japanese carts.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Orochi Team (Evil Chris, Evil Shermie, Evil Yashiro) : at the Character select screen, hold Start and press any button on the normal team (Chris, Shermie, Yashiro).[CR]* KOF94 Art of Fighting characters (Ryo, Robert, Yuri) : at the character select screen, hold Start and press any button on the Art of Fighting characters.[CR]* KOF95 style Kyo : at the Character select screen, hold Start on Kyo and press any button.[CR]* Real Bout 2 characters (Mai, Terry, Andy, Billy) : at the Character select screen, hold Start on the respective characters and press any button.[CR]* View attitudes : hold Start at the match-up screen to view the attitudes of your opponents.[CR]* Select victory pose : immediately press A, B, C, or D after defeating your opponent.[CR]* Fight Vs Shingo Yabuki : you must win the first three levels by 3-0.[CR]* Finish the game using one of these combinations to see the special endings :[CR]1) Kyo, Shingo, Saisyu[CR]2) Kyo, Iori, Chizuru[CR]3) Kyo, Iori, Shingo[CR]4) Kyo, Saisyu, Chris[CR]5) Kyo, Terry, Ryo[CR]6) Benimaru, Andy, Robert[CR]7) Goro, Joe, Yuri[CR]8) Terry, Clark, Lucky[CR]9) Ryo, Yuri, Takuma[CR]10) Yuri, Mai, Athena[CR]11) Heidern, Ralf, Leona[CR]12) Yashiro, Chris, Yamazaki[CR]13) Rugal, Vice, Mature[CR]14) Shermie, Vice, Mature[CR]15) Shingo, Chris, Kensou[CR]16) Kim, Saisyu, Takuma[CR]17) Billy, Joe, Chang[CR]18) Chin, Chang, Choi[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

			<plot>The King of Fighters '99 - Millennium Battle (c) 1999 SNK.[CR]Introducing the new 'striker' system! Each team is expanded to four characters, with a total of 30 selectable characters set on defeating Krizalid and his evil feather coat.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-251[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player.[CR][JOYSTICK] 8-way, [A] Weak punch, [B] Weak kick, [C] Strong punch, [D] Strong kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released on July 22, 1999 in Japan.[CR]The Fatal Fury Team music theme is a remixed version of Terry's theme in "Fatal Fury Wild Ambition".[CR]About K' (K Dash) : K' initially sported a slicked back hairstyle, but this was nixed by the powers that be and that's how the 'hairdo' for the hero of the NESTS Chronicles got changed. The reason for his hair being bushier than need be may be a reflection of the conditions around him. "Garou - Mark of the Wolves" was being developed concomitantly with KOF '99, so the staff learned that MOW's main character (Rock) looked like K' (causing the supervising designer to lose a few pounds from panic).[CR]About Maxima : With the growing influence of teenagers, it seems the concept for Maxima evolved from a desire to introduce a sober and reliable middle-age character (sad state of affairs though when a twenty-something male is referred to as 'middle-aged'). The designers were initially supposed to design a character that used body slams, but the finished character became a fist-fighter. Strange how things happen, isn't it? Maxima was originally modified by the male scientist Dr. Makishima, but in a serialized KOF comic that came out in Hong Kong, he, for some reason, became a 'beautiful woman doctor'. This comic is hard to get your hands on in other parts of the world, but check it out if you have the opportunity.[CR]About Whip : The plan was to introduce this character in KOF '96, but since Leona was already a part of the Ikari Team she began her series of appearances in KOF '99. Since Leona exposes comparatively more skin, Whip sports less revealing but body-hugging fashions that leave a little more to the imagination. The number of dots used on Whip's whip were reduced to express a feeling of speed and power - a daring method of expression. The supervising designer was sweating bullets over this when the design was checked (he feared he'd be accused of slacking off), but in the end the concept was approved without incident. The designers hoped that she would be accepted as an independent, whip-brandishing character rather than just another member of the Ikari Team.[CR]About Pao : Due to circumstances regarding the game structure, a new character had to be added to the Psycho Soldier Team, and various ideas for this additional character were formulated. Some of these included: 'a younger idol from Athena's agency'; 'a love rival pitted against Kensou', 'a mighty male character with a scary appearance but a heart of gold and a love of nature', 'an old woman who looks after Chin Gentsai', and many others. With the appearance of Pao, the average age of the Psycho Soldier Team dropped dramatically...or was supposed to, but things didn't actually change that much (it dropped from 42 to 34 years old).[CR]About Li Xiangfei : When development began for KOF '99, the designers grappled over which character from Real Bout 2 to choose, Rick Stroud or Li Xiang Fei. Giving the reasons that a cute female character and a Chinese boxer was desired, they unanimously selected Li Xiang Fei. Needless to say, the designers who came to this decision were all men. Typical! With the actual execution of this, however, the designers struggled to bring the character into the KOF world without ruining her image created in the Fatal Fury series. As you all know Li's move names in the Japanese version are all derived from place names in Osaka, so the designers enjoyed the work of coming up with names following this rule when new moves were added. Moves like Eiki Shuho (Vanguard Blast, in English) and Daikoku-cho (Big and Ugly Ultimatum) give her twice the appeal for local fans...[CR]About Jhun Hoon : The savior of Chang Koehan and Choi Bounge, an evil fighter who's Kim's alter-ego, a fellow disciple who looks like Kim - these were some of the concepts for Jhun, but as you can gather from the current character he's way different from what was planned. And since he's not an evil character, this naturally meant Chang and Choi would not be saved from their predicament; so, sadly, they continue to walk the slow and steady path to redemption that they've been walking these long 10 years. Jhun is also the first character in KOF history to adopt the concept of the 'pose'. Coming up and creating this kind of move really put the designers to the test.[CR]About Kyo Kusanagi-1 : Actually Kyo Kusanagi-1 and Kyo Kusanagi-2 were not scheduled to appear in KOF '99 at the time. Nor were Kyo or Iori Yagami supposed to either. Designers initially decided to leave them out because of the new storyline and wanted to focus more attention on the new character of K'. But for various reasons, designers came to the conclusion that designer couldn't leave these popular characters in limbo, so they got a reprieve (and a new wardrobe, too). Designers also felt the old Kyo dressed in his school uniform was necessary and hurried to include him in the game (See Kyo Kusanagi-2 for more details).[CR]About Kyo Kusanagi-2 : Production was reaching its climax when the idea for including various Kyos was hit upon... While the staff kvetched - "Should the design for Kyo in a student's uniform come from KOF '94 or KOF '95?"; "We don't have time to think this over!" - the project head said : "Make two designs". The staff objected timidly : "Are you nuts? We don't have time for that!". So the project planner remarked, "OK, then. I'll design them". Having hung up his character-designing clothes years ago, the head planner whipped up designs Kyo Kusanagi-1 and Kyo Kusanagi-2 in no time. Naturally, designers were blown away by his mastery and speed rivaling that of a street-performing sketch artist.[CR]Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.[CR]Soundtracks:[CR][JP] Aug. 18, 1999; The King of Fighters '99 [PCCB-00387] - Pony Canyon[CR][JP] Sep. 17, 1999; The King of Fighters '99 [Arrange Sound Trax] [PCCB-00393] - Pony Canyon[CR][JP] Oct. 06, 1999; The King of Fighters '99 [Drama CD] [PCCB-00394] - Pony Canyon[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as 'Real' Kyo Kusanagi or Iori Yagami (you need to get 'K.I' on the logo screen to be able to use Kyo or Iori).[CR]1) To get 'K', you must use a team of 4 random characters consisting at least of three of these characters : K, Maxima, Benimaru, Shingo, Whip, Kyo-1 or Kyo-2.[CR]2) To get 'I', you must use a team of 4 random characters consisting at least of three of these characters : Leona, Athena, Bao, Xiangfei, Kasumi, Kim or Jhun.[CR]3) Then you must defeat Kryzalid and a screen will show you how to do the code.[CR]4) For 'Real' Kyo Kusanagi, highlight the roulette selection box.

The Last Blade is set during this time period and you can see Europeans in some backgrounds, as well as some European dress influences on some characters.[CR]This game has a lot to do with Japanese religion. In what little understanding of Japanese culture, there are four gods in Japanese mythology : Seiryuu (blue dragon), Suzaku (red phoenix), Byakko (white tiger) and Genbu. Each god is associated with a direction : Byakko with west, Seiryuu with east, Genbu with north and Suzaku in the south. The four gods also seem to be portrayed in an identical manner : Suzaku is often seen as a renegade of sorts, Genbu is often wise, Byakko seems to be strong and Seiryuu seems to be the role of the protagonist. To this end, the four characters that are avatars to these gods in Gekka no Kenshi (Kaede, Okina, Shigen and Kagami) seem to fit the gods themselves to a tee (Kaede to Seiryuu, Okina to Genbu, Shigen to Byakko and Kagami to Suzaku). However, there may be one (unintentional) reference to the entire fighting game itself. These four characters may very well represent the four popular styles of characters found in nearly fighting game :[CR]Kaede is a Shotokan-style character. This type of character, of course, is the earliest type of fighting game character (as early fighting games always had the protagonist be proficient in some form of karate). However, ever since the release of "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", a Shoto-character refers to a character with similar moves to that of Ryu and Ken from that game, or more specifically, a character with a projectile and a built upper. Kaede fits this property well : his Ittou Hayate is a projectile (much like Ryu's Hadou Ken) and his Ittou Kuuga is a built upper (like Ken's Shoryuu Ken). Of course, Kaede may also be a nod to that of SNK's first fighting game protagonist (Terry Bogard) as well : his Kasshin Fukuryuu super is in the style of Terry's Power Geyser. To this day, many fighting game characters are known as Shoto characters - their simplicity can't be beat.[CR]Shigen is a large character. Large characters come generally in two flavors : the power character and the grappler (Shigen himself is a mix of both). Power characters generally don't move much but deal lots of damage per hit. Grapplers are those whose special moves are mainly throws. These characters tend to last longer because of their size, but have a weakness that they have either short range or are slow (or, in the case of some characters, overly complicated moves).[CR]Okina may be described as a turtler. This may seem like an inside joke (Okina, in his profile, refers to his family as a bunch of turtles), but it sometimes make sense.[CR]Jokes aside, turtlers are not exactly a type of character, but a type of player. That is, a turtler is a player who tend to block attacks a lot.[CR]Charge characters (i.e. those whose repertoire of moves are mainly charge moves) generally fall into this category, as it is often that they need to remain in a blocking position in order to get their charges and counterattack.[CR]Over the years, there have been many incentives to stray away from this style (as well as derivatives thereof, such as ticking), such as guard breaks, overheads, low attacks, shorter charges and unblockable moves.[CR]Granted, the turtler is not as big as a factor as it used to be (the most popular character in "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" was Guile because of his turtling and ticking abilities), but Okina's reference to turtles remains.[CR]Kagami, of course, continues SNK's tradition of making cheap-ass characters for final bosses.[CR]Akari and Juzoh are the comedic relief characters in the Gekka series : Juzoh is seen in Akari's stage if Akari is fighting (and obviously, if Akari is not fighting Juzoh). Likewise, Akari can be seen in Juzoh's stage if Juzoh is fighting (and if Juzoh isn't fighting against Akari).[CR]Soundtrack releases :[CR]Bakumatsu Roman - Gekka no Kenshi / SNK Shinsekai Gakkyoku Zatsugidan - Pony Canyon / Scitron - PCCB-00287 - December 17, 1997[CR]Bakumatsu Roman - Gekka no Kenshi Arrange Sound Trax / SNK Shinsekai Gakkyoku Zatsugidan - Pony Canyon / Scitron - PCCB-00301 - January 21, 1998[CR]Bakumatsu Roman - Gekka no Kenshi Drama CD -Pony Canyon / Scitron - PCCB-00302 - February 04, 1998[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]On the AES version, Musashi and Kagami are playable characters by imputing a code.

			<plot>League Bowling (c) 1990 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].[CR]A colourful and playable ten-pin bowling game for 1 to 4 players, offering a choice of three scoring methods : 'Regulation', 'Flash' and 'Strike 90'.[CR]The game begins with players selecting either a right or left-handed bowler, before choosing what weight they want their bowling balls to be. Once the match starts properly, Power and Direction meters will appear and players must use both their judgement and timing to select and execute the desired bowl. Timing is key as players are only allowed twenty seconds to make each shot.[CR]The 'Strike 90' mode awards players ninety points for a strike and sixty points for a spare. In the 'Flash' game mode, the points flash across the lane as the players throw the ball. Should they succeed in knocking down the standing pins, the points that are displayed at the time the pins are struck will be added to the players' scores.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-019[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 Players - 4 Buttons Per Player (only 1 usable).[CR][Joystick] 8-Way, [A] Set Controls/Set Power[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]League Bowling was released on December 10, 1990.[CR]Nadia from Secret of Blue Water make a cameo in this game.

			<plot>Magical Drop III (c) 1997 Data East.[CR]More characters, more gameplay modes, more frantic gameplay, more fun! This is what every videogame sequel should be, and the sequel to one of the best puzzle games for the Neo-Geo MVS is indeed a game not to be missed! Lots of fun for one or two players![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID: NGM-233[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons: 3[CR]=&gt; [A] Catch Balloons, [B] Throw Balloons, [C] Shift the balloons a line down[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Magical Drop III was released on February 25, 1997. This is Data East's final arcade video game. [CR]The game now features parodies of all the characters featured in the 22 cards of the major Arcana in a Tarot card deck. These are numbered from 0 to 21 as follows : [CR]00. Fool [CR]01. Magician [CR]02. High Priestess [CR]03. Emperor [CR]04. Empress [CR]05. Hierophant [CR]06. Lovers [CR]07. Chariot [CR]08. Strength [CR]09. Hermit [CR]10. (Wheel of) Fortune [CR]11. Justice [CR]12. Hanged Man [CR]13. Death [CR]14. Temperance [CR]15. Devil [CR]16. Tower [CR]17. Star [CR]18. Moon [CR]19. Sun [CR]20. Judgement [CR]21. World [CR]Note that the only exception to this statement would be Black Pierrot since he does not appear in a Tarot card deck. Black Pierrot is an added bonus character to challenge really good Magical Drop 3 pros! [CR]Note : In puzzle and adventure modes, only 8 characters are available : Fool, High Priestess, Emperor, Lovers, Chariot, Strength, Justice and Star. [CR]Default highscore table : [CR]Name Score Reactions Time [CR]1ST D.E 5000 8 06:00 [CR]2ND D.E 4500 7 05:30 [CR]3RD D.E 4000 6 05:00 [CR]4TH D.E 3500 5 04:30 [CR]5TH D.E 3000 4 04:00 [CR]Soundtrack releases (for limited edition): [CR]Magical Drop III - Pony Canyon / Scitron - PCCBX-00002 - March 21, 1997[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The Japanese version of this game features LOTS of stuff unavailable in any other version :[CR]* In Challenge Mode there is a story intro at the beginning explaining the reason behind the Magical Drop competition, an extra animation showing a close-up of the Magical Drop book as it opens,  an ending for each character available in the game, a "Hard" difficulty setting, as well as a bonus fortune reading when you beat the Challenge Mode or you lose against the CPU and  refuse to continue. All of this is absent in the USA &amp; Europe versions.[CR]* In Challenge Mode, each character has a unique set of quotes before a battle begins, this even applies in the battles against the end bosses Tower &amp; Fortune. In the USA &amp; Europe versions there are only two possible quotes before a fight for all characters :[CR]Quote #1[CR]CPU : Get out of my way![CR]Player : I'll never lose to you! [CR]Quote #2[CR]CPU : You want to fight?[CR]Player : Now let's see who is better![CR]* In Adventure mode, each character has its very own story intro as well as its very own ending which is different from the one seen in Challenge mode. Additionally this mode plays like a board game in which you compete against three other characters on the board, and if any of the others get to Empress' castle before your character, you will get a generic bad ending. If you arrive on a tile already occupied by a CPU-controlled character, you will have 2 options :[CR]1) The option on the right : you don't want to trouble and ignore the opponent (sometimes you will have to back off 1 tile)[CR]2) The option on the left : you fight the opponent. If you win, he or she will be eliminated but it would be the same for you if you fail, so be careful![CR]In the USA and European versions, there is no storyline and the only character on the board is controlled by the player. [CR]* Like in the previous game, each character has his/her own unique voice. The European version features less voice tracks and the USA version features a single voice track for all characters.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Father Strength : At the character select screen, highlight Strength, hold C and press A or B. This trick does not work nor in puzzle mode nor in adventure mode. [CR]* Play with bonus characters : At the character select screen, highlight any character (Except World, World's number is 21 so she can't be used for this trick) and wait until the timer counts down to the number assigned to that character : [CR]00 - Fool [CR]01 - Magician [CR]02 - High Priestess [CR]03 - Empress [CR]04 - Emperor [CR]05 - Hierophant [CR]06 - Lovers [CR]07 - Chariot [CR]08 - Strength [CR]11 - Justice [CR]13 - Death [CR]15 - Devil [CR]17 - Star [CR]19 - Sun [CR]20 - Judgment [CR]Then push C only three times. Moon, Hanged Man, Hermit, Temperance, Tower and Fortune will appear and will now be selectable. This trick does neither work in puzzle mode nor in adventure mode. [CR]* Secret Stages : [CR]1) Moon (after Level 6) : Finish the sixth stage without exceeding 90 seconds since the beginning. [CR]2) Hanged Man (after Level 6) : Finish the sixth stage exceeding 300 seconds since the beginning. [CR]3) Black Pierrot (after Level 10) : Finish the tenth stage with at least 150000 points.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Magical Drop (1995, Arcade)[CR]2. Magical Drop Plus 1! (1995, Arcade)[CR]3.

			<plot>Magician Lord (c) 1990 Alpha Denshi Company, Limited.[CR]Magician Lord is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up in which players take on the roll of a wizard called Elta - the last Magician Lord - on his quest to save his homeland from the evil Gul-Agieze, who plans to resurrect the God of Destruction using 8 tomes of mystical power.[CR]Elta has to jump, shoot and climb his way to the end of each of the game's 8 levels where he must beat a servant of Gal, along with one of Gal's sinister boss creations. To complete the game Elta must reach the final stage and defeat Az Atorse himself. If the player takes too long to complete a stage, Elta will be harassed by an invincible monster.[CR]Elta's primary form of attack is a weak but fast-moving energy projectile that can fired in one of four directions, but by collecting the special coloured orbs that ocassionally appear, he can transform into a different form, making him more powerful and giving him new attacks.[CR]These are the six different forms that Elta can assume by picking up the colored orbs:[CR]* Dragon Warrior: In this form Elta attacks by breathing fire; a continuous short-range attack that, unlike the standad attack, can also be aimed diagonally.[CR]* Waterman: The Waterman-form attacks with water grenades &#8211; blue bubbles of water that burst upon touching the ground and form into water pillars. The attack can hit several times for additional damage but only covers a small area.[CR]* Poseidon: A more powerful version of the Waterman, Poseidon shoots wide waves of water that travel along the ground for several hits. It does severe damage and causes enemies to freeze and shatter on impact. While very powerful, this form moves very slowly.[CR]* Shinobi: The Shinobi-form gains increased agility and attacks with powerful magical arcs of fire which are wide but slow-moving.[CR]* Samurai: While limited in range, the Samurai-form is the only form that can attack through walls, shields or even multiple enemies, using a boomerang-like energy attack that does heavy damage.[CR]* Raijin: The Raijin-form gives Elta's jumping ability a big boost as well as a unique attack that creates a continuous electrical field around his body.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID: NGM-005[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons: 2[CR]=&gt; [A] Shot, [B] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Magician Lord was released on April 26, 1990.

			<plot>Metal Slug - Super Vehicle-001 (c) 1996 Nazca.[CR]A scrolling 'run-and-gun' platform game for one or two players, Metal Slug is a humorous parody of war and specifically of World War II and the Nazis.[CR]The game features six enemy-packed levels, referred to as 'missions'. Players start the game armed only with a pistol, but extra weapons can be picked up and used for greater firepower. Also, at certain points during a level players will find an unused 'Super Vehicle-001' - or Metal Slug - tank which can be entered and driven. The Metal Slug is slow-moving but has very powerful weapons. If the Slug takes too many hits it will break down and start to flash, the player must then quickly exit the vehicle before it explodes. The enemy troops also have vehicles at their disposal, such as tanks, boats and helicopters.[CR]The levels are littered with bearded hostages who, when rescued, award players with either points bonuses (in the form of medals) or weapon power-ups. Available weapons are Heavy Machine Gun, Flame Shot, Rocket Launcher and Shotgun. Hand grenades are also available.[CR]Each level ends with at least one large enemy 'Boss' vehicle that takes many hits to destroy. Once the boss has been destroyed, bonus points are awarded for each prisoner rescued. Further bonus points are awarded if the player's Metal Slug vehicle has survived the boss battle.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : 0201[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2610 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 320 x 224 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 59.19 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 4096[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; Character &gt; [A] Shoot, [B] Jump, [C] Grenade[CR]=&gt; Metal Slug&gt; [A] Gun Attack, [B] Jump Board Vehicle, [C] Artillery Attack[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Metal Slug was released in April 1996. [CR]Etymology of 'Metal Slug': Meeher, the lead designer of the game for Nazca, wanted to create an armored fighting vehicle that could crawl on the ground like a 'slug'. The word 'metal' in the title indicates that the vehicle is mechanical. Initially, players considered the title to be "not good enough". Meeher later joked about the title, saying "Maybe I don't make much [sic] of a sense?" [CR]Slugs in Metal Slug sequels included animals (usually only the Vulcan cannon mounted on the animal, with a cannon attachment occasionally available), planes and other vehicles that did not fit Meeher's original definition. [CR]While being an obvious parody of World War II and the Nazi regime (the rebel army's flag is a deliberate pastiche of the Nazi "Swastika"), Metal Slug also lampoons 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'MASH'. General Morden, the rebel army's evil general, is a parody of Saddam Hussein. [CR]Just as the two main heroes (Marco &amp; Tarma) appear in every chapter in the Metal Slug series, General Morden &amp; Allen O' Neill (the machine gun wielding, trash mouth-talking, buffed soldier) are the series' classic main villains.[CR]The tank in Metal Slug was inspired by the tank: Dominio Tank Police (1988). The tank in this anime is called Bonaparte and is piloted by Leona Ozaki.[CR]Cliff Reese holds the official record for this game with 2,683,030 points on March 8, 2011. [CR]The same team that created Metal Slug had previously created a handful of games for Irem, most of which featured very similar graphics and gameplay. "Cyber Lip" (1990) had some of the core developers as the original Metal Slug. "Gunforce" (1991) and "In the Hunt" (1993) had noticeably similar gameplay, with graphics that bear a slight resemblance to Metal Slug. "Gunforce 2" (1994) not only had similar gameplay but the sounds of dying soldiers were almost exactly the same as Metal Slug. Because of this, some fans refer to Gunforce 2 as "Metal Slug Zero".[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Metal Slug features a 'blood ON' option (soldiers squirt blood when shot, instead of water). This can be activated via the 'Setting The Soft Dip' option in the game's dip switch menu. [CR]* When you parachute into the level at the start of a mission, press B to make the parachute disappear, allowing your character to drop to the ground more quickly. [CR]* Don't waste ammo. Metal Slug requires some thinking and shooting indiscriminately is not the best way to play this game. [CR]* Don't waste special weapons on shields. Shielded soldiers will throw their shields aside when they need to fire, so shoot at them only at this instant. Or use your knife if you manage to get close enough. [CR]* Use your knife against lone enemies. There is no need to waste ten rounds of your Heavy Machine Gun on a single enemy soldier. [CR]* When Metal Slug is dangerously low on health (but not so low that you are forced to leave it), use the frontal attack to inflict major damage. [CR]* Whenever you jump out of the slug, you are invincible for a brief amount of time. This is especially useful against the blue mortars, since they can't be avoided. Note, however, that there is no period of invincibility when you jump back into the slug. [CR]* There is apparently no 'reload time' when you throw grenades or rockets. The rate depends on how many of either are currently on-screen so if you are close to an enemy, the rate will be negligible. You may use this trick against some bosses and in any other situation to pass through unscratched. [CR]* The best way to earn points in to rescue hostages, but this can be tricky. The first problem is finding them, the second is to stay alive to the end of the mission to get credit for your rescues. [CR]As well as the easily-spotted hostages that litter the levels, there are also numerous hidden hostages: [CR]MISSION 1 (hostages: 10): [CR]Two pairs of are hostages hidden in the two waterfalls just before you get to the boss. Just blast the tops of the waterfalls and they will fall. [CR]MISSION 2 (hostages: 12): [CR]Blast down at the green bush underneath the bridge just before you reach the mid level boss (large tank on rails above you) and three secret prisoners will come running in your direction. [CR]MISSION 3 (hostages: 15): [CR]There are secret hostages hidden within the two large trees that you can blast down in the section where you have the Metal Slug tank. These seem to be random, just try blasting those trees down and sometimes they appear. [CR]There are hidden hostages that drop down from the sky when you are fighting the end of level boss; just don't kill the boss until they have all appeared. [CR]MISSION 4 (hostages: 20): [CR]Just after you have got the Metal Slug tank at the beginning of the level, blast the ceiling of the bar just above the light/lampshade high up on the wall at the entrance of the bar. [CR]At the end of level bosses you can either blast in the top right hand corner of the cave to get three hidden hostages OR blast the far bottom left hand corner for three hidden hostages. It is not possible to get both of these groups. You can only get one or the other. [CR]MISSION 5 (hostages: 13):[CR]Blast the first and second houses and two hostages will appear. [CR]Fire at the top of the first and second trees in the stage in between the shops and houses. The first tree yields three POW's and the second only two.[CR]Blast the undercarriage of the end of level boss after it has lifted up on stilts to get three extra prisoners who also provide useful power ups. [CR]MISSION 6 (hostages: 25): [CR]At the beginning, shoot above you to find one prisoner. [CR]Destroy the big pack of rocks to deliver one POW. [CR]Blast the small white cloud above you just after the boat you are on has run ashore to get two hidden hostages. [CR]When you're out of the boat, go left in the water to find some points. [CR]POWs appear on screen during the fight with the final boss, if you shoot in the top right corner. [CR]* Beat the game in two players mode to view a different ending sequence.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Metal Slug - Super Vehicle-001 (1996)[CR]2.

			<plot>Metal Slug 2 - Super Vehicle-001/II (c) 1998 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].[CR]The heroes of Metal Slug, Marco and Tarma, are called into action once again to take on the might of General Morden and his armies in this, the first of several sequels to the superb 1996 original. This time, however, Morden has acquired a number of powerful allies to aid him in his evil schemes, some of which are not even human. The 2 brave soldiers are called upon to deal with this threat once again, aided by members of the newly founded 'Sparrow Squad', Fio and Eri.[CR]Metal Slug 2 improved on much of what made the first game great; featuring more enemies, larger bosses, more weapons, more vehicles, more hostages, more surprises and more humour than its illustrious predecessor. The occasional moments of slowdown that blighted the first game are still present, however.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID: NGM-241[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 3[CR]=&gt; Character &gt; [A] Shoot, [B] Jump, [C] Grenade[CR]=&gt; Metal Slug&gt; [A] Gun Attack, [B] Jump Board Vehicle, [C] Artillery Attack[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Metal Slug 2 was shown at the 1998 AOU Amusement Expo show, in Japan. Then it was released in February 1998.[CR]The game's alien enemies, together with the final battle and ending sequence, are a deliberate pastiche of the risible sci-fi blockbuster movie, 'Independence Day'.[CR]On the parental advisory screen (US version), 'advisory' is misspelled as 'advisoly'.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Metal Slug 2 Original Sound Tracks - PCCB-00311) on 17/04/1998.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]Rescued hostages are the greatest contributors of points. But you have to stay alive to get credit for your rescues (Once you complete a mission, you receive 10'000 pts for every POW).[CR]MISSION 1, Deserts of Arabia : You are sent to control a loyalist force suspected of building weapons of mass destruction.[CR]* The tallest tree after the 1st building contains lots of fruit and 3 hidden POW's.[CR]* Palace : Shoot towards the right of the red banner to release 2nd lieutenant Hyakutaro Ichimonji. This mystic POW has an energy bolt which is powerful and homes in on anything you can shoot (this means structures as well; collateral damage). He'll help you until you finish the mission or die.[CR]* You'll find the Camel Slug after the conversing Arabs. It comes equipped with a Vulcan but provides no cover against enemy fire. Like the Metal Slug, the Camel can run over enemy soldiers.[CR]* BOSS 1, Harrier VTOL : Waves of swordsmen rush at you. Take them out before they get too close. After about 100 shots, 2 bazooka grunts open fire. Stay in between the jet exhausts. Aim for the engines as much as possible (You'll see and get 10,000 pt. for the 1st wing and 50,000 for the 2nd).[CR]MISSION 2, Valley of the Pharaohs : Intelligence has indicated that the enemy army is using a secret Egyptian site to house military machinery.[CR]* Use your gun to knock out an eye from the Sphinx (30,000 pts).[CR]* Without hitting the explosive barrel, kill the Imperial Guards. Then, fire at the top right corner offscreen, for 3 POW's.[CR]* If you stand next to the 1st and 3rd miners, they'll dig up some bonus items.[CR]* Shoot at the top right of the support tower for a POW.[CR]* Pyramid slope : A gem or 3 POW's are hidden at the top of the screen, right above the spot where the 1st mummy pops up.[CR]* If you get a whiff of undead breath, you'll become a member of the undead, identifiable only by headgear. You'll be carrying only a pistol. Jumping is also quite a task. The flashing healing potions will turn you back into a human instantly.[CR]* Near the door, get the POW's before clearing out the mummies.[CR]* You'll catch up with Rumi Aikawa here. Shoot her for a healing potion or points.[CR]* The eye hieroglyph before the special mummy hides a gem.[CR]* Shoot the deceased explorer to make her give up a gem. Disgruntled, she'll give you the matching stick of dynamite.[CR]* Jogging to the left, you'll see a few platforms to jump on. From the 2nd to the top, you can carefully jump over to the right. The long one holds 2 treasure chests. But don't stop here. Carefully jump on top of the cat statues. Shoot the chest open, which holds a magic lamp. If you are patient enough, a djinni will appear. Wait just a moment longer, and he'll grant a wish for riches. Starting from the moment the lamp is released, count the plumes of smoke and jump after the 5th one. Shoot above the right statue for another magic lamp.[CR]* On the next level path (8th platform), the head of the hieroglyph holds gems. Shoot'em out!![CR]* If you let the mummy attack the explorer, you can destroy the new mummy for a gem.[CR]* The twin-armed Slugnoid vehicle is located on one of the higher ledges of the tower of doom. The main cannon (C) fires downwards ((A)+(B) Swan Dive)[CR]* BOSS 2, Iron Claw : Use your cannon and bombs. If you stay at the same altitude for a while, Iron Claw rears back and charges towards you. It won't fire while doing so, giving you time to get free hits in. When Iron Claw primes up, jump to the side ledges.[CR]* BOSS 2 Freeze bug - Stop the nasty climbing! This original flaw give players an unfair advantage to eliminate Boss2 without any difficulty. Below is the following of how to activate. When the player standing on the platform which placed on the last chest, jump to the right edge of the next platform and fall to right lower platform immediately. The screen scrolls up and the boss emerges from the bottom of the screen. Instead of being killed as usual, the player is still there safe and sound ,while the boss freezes and do no climbing at all. At this moment, Just stay on the platform where you are and attack then it will be destroyed afterwards. The trick is also possible when riding the slugnoid or two players' game, but both player must do it at the same time.[CR]MISSION 3, Supply Train : You've managed to catch up with an enemy train headed for a night shipment to the Far East.[CR]* At the engine of the train, rescue the POW. Shoot at the smokestack from below to release 3 POW's.[CR]* From the head of the engine, manage to clear more space with your jump to the next train for 50,000 pt.[CR]* Use the Slug flyer which is equipped with a Vulcan that is limited in angular range.[CR]* BOSS 3, Four Legger : While the boss is standing, jump to shoot at it. Everything except the flame-thrower can be avoided by hiding underneath its legs. If you still have the Slug flyer, stay on the left.[CR]MISSION 4, Chinese City, Downtown : A platoon of enemy troops is stationed nearby. [CR]* Collect as much of the food as you can. Once you're fat, your weapons will cause more damage but you'll be slower.[CR]* Most of the buildings can be demolished, revealing hidden POW's or bonuses. Some of the POW's can be reached by knocking down the building they're on or the one next to it.[CR]* Right about where the monkey and fish are, jump into an opening in the walkway and find POW's and a diet shake.[CR]* Sitting on a rooftop of the residential area is your Metal Slug.[CR]* BOSS 4, Big Tank (kind of battleship) : Only the cannons take damage during this battle. If using the Metal Slug, try for the lower cannons first. Use the houses and boulders to aim for the higher guns.[CR]MISSION 5, New York : The townsfolk have been complaining about strange smells and sounds coming from the sewers. Intelligence confirms that a battalion is stationed inside, ready for an invasion. [CR]* Jump on top of any of the cars, firing downwards. The car will burst in flames, sending you into the sky to reach a lot of bonus items.[CR]* At the end of the street, shoot at the fire escape of the last building for 3 POW's and into the tree for fruits.[CR]* At the underground railroad, shoot into the top of the arch for POW's.[CR]* As soon as one of the 4 trains approaches from the right, fire immediately.[CR]After destroying each one, run to the right to regain any lost ground.[CR]* After marker zero (0), the track bends from here. But before you shoot at the EXIT door, fire at the ceiling. There are 3 separate spots with hostages.[CR]* In the sewers, you see a box with an arrow on it. Find the lever and press (A) to wind it. After 3 turns, an item will drop down with a weapon or bonus.[CR]* BOSS 5, Nuclear Submarine : Surfacing from the sewer slime, the sub attacks with a lot of lightning balls and a thunder cannon. When you see double barrels pop up, prepare for some serious thunder. Fire the Vulcan and bomb it at the same time. [CR]MISSION 6, Siberian Shipyard : Far from Moscow, the rebel army has secretly established war factories and rebel headquarters.[CR]* Mountainside : the sign with the arrow hides a POW.[CR]* Midboss, Super Soldier : Fully recovered from his wounds of Metal Slug 1, he challenges you to another showdown. The horizontal shots can be ducked. Sometimes, you can knife him once and jump away. Take whatever shots you can in the meanwhile.[CR]* In the submarine factory, after busting the tank, use the platform to release the hostage on the higher platform.[CR]* Small platforms give you access to some of the prisoners on the top level, but it's easier to fight aliens on the lower platform.[CR]* When the 2nd area is clear, turn the crank to release a Laser Rifle.[CR]* 3 POW's are hanging at the top of the screen after the 3rd area.[CR]* A POW is hidden on the short plank in the 4th area.[CR]* BOSS 6, Battle Drone : Use the platform to the left whenever possible. When the rod is exposed, it will prime up for 2 seconds, then fire a bolt. Keep a constant fire when free from the Battle Pods. [CR]* FINAL BOSS, Mothership : Fear not the various grunts and tanks, they are here to help you. Try using them for cover. Aiming upward from anywhere will hit some section of the ship. The soldiers bring in a Metal Slug later in the battle, just unload it from the truck. After a long and ruthless battle, the Mothership withdraws.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

			<plot>Metal Slug 3 (c) 2000 SNK.[CR]The heroes of the first 2 games return once more to do battle with the ever-present General Morden and his vast army. The third game of the series places a greater emphasis on defeating hulking boss characters than the 2 previous outings. Metal Slug 3 also introduced multiple routes through most levels, vastly increasing the replay value of the game. For example; on the first level the player reaches a point where they can either continue over land, or enter a small submarine and head down into the ocean depths, where they will be faced with a variety of huge, deadly sea-dwelling creatures.[CR]Metal Slug 3 introduced a number of new elements that have a direct effect on the player's character - similar to the 'mummification' of the second game. The first of these is the 'fatty' affect : should the player pick up too much food (fish, for example) their character will morph in an obese version of itself. This doesn't have any detrimental effect on performance and is included purely for reasons of humour. Another effect is the now infamous 'Zombiefication'; should the player's character be attacked by a Zombie, he or she will become Zombie until they are either killed, or pick up a first-aid, which will restore the player's character back to human form. Movement while in the zombie state is slow and restricted but the player is armed with what can perhaps be best described as the 'Zombie Vomit'; a huge arc of blood that can be used to destroy oncoming enemies. A second Zombie attack while the player's character is in a Zombie state will result in the player losing a life.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-256[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; Character &gt; [A] Shoot, [B] Jump, [C] Grenade[CR]=&gt; Metal Slug&gt; [A] Gun Attack, [B] Jump Board Vehicle, [C] Artillery Attack[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Metal Slug 3 was released in May 2000. This game was the last game in the Metal Slug series developed by SNK. The underwater stages are a graphical nod to Irem's 1993 classic, "In the Hunt". This is understandable as many of SNK's Metal Slug developers originally worked for Irem.[CR]Metal Slug 3 features a number of sci-fi movie homages : Mission 2 features a guest appearance by the Men in Black. The carnivorous plant aliens in Mission 4 are a parody of the sci-fi musical comedy, 'The Little Shop of Horrors'. The squid-like aliens in the gigantic Mission 5 (known as 'Mars People') are a homage to the movie, 'Independence Day'. Also, the alien clones you face in this stage seem to parody the sci-fi movie clasic, 'Invasion of the body snatchers'. Finally, the last boss battle seems to be slightly inspired by the ending sequence in the sci-fi horror movie, 'Alien Resurrection'. One of the hostages (who also appeared in "Metal Slug 2" &amp; "Metal Slug X", by the way) known as Hyakkutaro will join the fight by shooting fireballs.[CR]Noise Factory released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Metal Slug 3 Original Soundtrack - NF-0002) on 31/01/2003.[CR]A hack of this game was released in 2005 as "Metal Slug 6 [Hack]", one year before the official "Metal Slug 6".[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

			<plot>NAM-1975 (c) 1990 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].[CR]One or two players take control of 2 machine-gun carrying Vietnam vets who must shoot their way through a number of sideways scrolling, Vietnam-themed levels. the players shoot into the screen and aiming is achieved via the use an on-screen target, which each player directs to lock on to the various enemy troops and vehicles. Players can run and somersault to avoid the incoming enemy fire.[CR]A number of more powerful weapons - such as grenades and flame throwers - are often dropped by the enemy and can be picked up and used. Bonus points are also revealed in this fashion.[CR]Nam-1975 is a blatant plagiarism of TAD Corp's "Cabal", released in September 1988.

Unlike the main firepower, which is only straight ahead, the shuri-ken can be fired in all directions by moving the joystick in the opposite direction of which you wish to aim (example : to fire to the left, move the joystick to right and vice versa). This is also the best way to deal with a few of the bosses here : for example, on the stage set in feudal Japan, there are two giant sumo wrestlers who appear as sub-bosses. The main firepower seems to only have minor effect on them, but the shuri-ken are much more effective.[CR]The C button is for firing magical bursts of energy. One drawback is that, similar to "Final Fight" this can cause a little of your life energy to be drained, so it should be used very carefully.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Producer: Tsutomu Maruyama[CR]Director: Tsutomu Maruyama[CR]Executive Producer : Kazuo Arai[CR]Director Of Software : Eiji Fukatsu[CR]System programmers : Makio Chiba, Satoshi Okada (SNK)[CR]Programmers : Ryu Hiroyuki, Yuji Noguchi[CR]Character Designers : Tsutomu Maruyama, Shinji Moriyama (as Sinji Moriyama), Takashi Hatono, Hidemi Nagatomo, Hideyuki Kusano[CR]Music Composer : Yuka Watanabe[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]SNK Neo-Geo [JP] (May 29, 1992; "Ninja Commando [Model NGH-050]")[CR]SNK Neo-Geo [US] (May 29, 1992; "Ninja Commando [Model NGH-050]")[CR]SNK Neo-Geo CD [JP] (October 31, 1994; "Ninja Commando [Model ADCD-004]")[CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [JP] (December 18, 2008; "ADK Tamashii [Model SLPS-25906]")[CR]Nintendo Wii [Virtual Console] [JP] (June 24, 2008; "Ninja Commando [Model EAPJ]")[CR]Nintendo Wii [Virtual Console] [US] (July 11, 2008; "Ninja Commando [Model EAPE]")[CR]Nintendo Wii [Virtual Console] [AU] (July 11, 2008; "Ninja Commando)[CR]Nintendo Wii [Virtual Console] [EU] (July 14, 2008; "Ninja Commando [Model EAPP]")[CR]</plot>

It was actually a hack of "Super Sidekicks 3" made by SNK themselves. His subtitle is a homage for "Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory"[CR]A serious bug: Using a USA bios rom if you insert a coin on the 'winners don't use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neogeo bios s1 tileset rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the mainboard z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attract loop after gameover, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* View The Name List : At title screen hold A+B+C and press Start to begin.[CR]* Each team has 0, 1, 2, or 3 strengths.

Ten selectable characters and two end bosses.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : 217[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2610 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 4[CR]=&gt; [A] Light Punch, [B] Strong Punch, [C] Light Kick, [D] Strong Kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Ninja Master's Haoh Ninpou Chou was released in May 1996.[CR]The subtitle of this game translates from Japanese as 'Supreme Ninja Arts Scroll'.[CR]The main design, as well as some of the special moves of the character 'Karasu' seem to be quite inspired by the main character of the 1994 movie hit 'The Crow' which was in turn, based on the graphical novel of the same name by James O. Barr (Even the name 'Karasu' stands as the Japanese word for "crow"!). :)[CR]The character 'Nobunaga' is based on the real Japanese warrior 'Nobunaga Oda' who, during Japan's medieval period, overthrew the Ashikaga shogunate and ended a long period of internal strife by uniting half of Japan's provinces under his rule. In doing so he paved the way for the reunification of the country under the Tokugawa shogunate in the following century. His merciless use of power as well as his skill as a military strategist made him one of the most powerful &amp; feared leaders in Japan. The image of him in the game as a warrior who wields the demons power may have been some sort of a criticism to his eager embrace of Western culture, religion &amp; technology.[CR]The character 'Goemon' is based on Ishikawa Goemon, the most famous thief in Japan on the Edo era (about 400 years ago) known to steal large sums of money from bad people and give the money to the poor. In other words, he was Japan's very own version of Robin Hood![CR]The character 'Sasuke' seems inspired on Sarutobi Sasuke, a famous legendary ninja with a strong sense of justice created in Tachikawa literature at the end of the Meiji period. Another source of inspiration may have been 'Ninja Kamui' an old anime series whose main character Kamui was an incredibly skilled ninja who wanted to abandon his ways as a killer thus becoming a 'nukenin' (runaway ninja) and marked for death by his own clan that vows to pursue and eliminate him.[CR]Sountrack releases :[CR][JP] Ninja Master's Haoh Ninpou Chou - G.S.M 1500 Series - PCCB-00209, March 21, 1996, Pony Canyon / Scitron[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play As Ranmaru And Nobunaga (Player 1) : Highlight Kamui and press Left, Down, Left, Up, Left, Down, Left, Up, Right, Down, Right, Up and hit C+D.[CR]* Play As Ranmaru And Nobunaga (Player 2) : Highlight Sasuke and press Right, Down, Right, Up, Right, Down, Right, Up, Left, Down, Left, Up and hit C+D.[CR]* Time Attack Mode : At the character select screen, highlight Kamui and press Down, Left, Up, Left, Down, Left, Up, Left, Down, Right(x4), Up, C+D.

Features very nice graphics with cool backgrounds, great soundtrack &amp; pretty fun gameplay in the same style as "Snow Bros. - Nick &amp; Tom", "Tumble Pop" &amp; "Zupapa!".

As long as you do not get hit, the diamonds will continue to go up in value until they finally reach 10,000 each. Grabbing the sacks will add multipliers (2X, 4X, up to 8X) that will further increase your score.[CR]* There are many cracks in the wood/stone of most levels. Some of these will reveal a fireball that will make your shot fly all over the board. Experiment with throwing at different angles to find these hidden spots. Most will clear the entire board as the ball flings out of control.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Programmer : Hisanori Takeuchi (AM FACTORY)[CR]Graphic designers : Hiroshi Yokoyama, Masayuki Taguchi, Tsuyoshi Yoneyama, Taketumi Watanabe (ELEVEN)[CR]Sound composer : Kim[CR]Data convert : Tatsuya Watanabe (PAON)[CR]Director : Akihiko Uto[CR]</plot>

			<plot>Pochi to Nyaa (c) 2003 Aiky.[CR]Pochi to Nyaa is a cutesy puzzle game where the objective is to match the colored invaders in chains much in the vein of the Sega game "Puyo Puyo Fever". Pochi to Nyaa features three different modes of play: story mode, vs. computer mode, and two player vs. mode.[CR]Story mode is a bare bones, single player game with three difficulty settings.  The player works to build up chains in order to gain more time to play in one endless level. Once the timer runs out the game is over.[CR]Vs. Computer mode is more of a real story mode where the player takes on the role of the novice wizard Prim, who has foolishly been lured into the "Pochi and Nyaa Tournament" by the promises of pudding. Before each battle Prim engages her opponent in a brief dialogue in order to advance the storyline. The player advances to the next opponent after winning one round. If the player loses the round then it is game over.[CR]Vs. Player mode is a standard two player battle mode and begins with a character select screen.  After the characters are selected there is a short dialogue to introduce the players' characters and then the battle begins. Whoever wins two round of gameplay is the victor. Unlike many other two player games, Pochi to Nyaa vs. mode is played on one credit and so once the winner is announced the game is over.[CR]In both single player mode games there is a brief introduction to the gameplay to assist the novice player.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : 0267[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz), Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2610 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 320 x 224 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 59.19 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 4096[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; [A] Turn nyan counterclockwise, [B] Turn nyan clockwise, [C] Change fally nyan to spiky nyan[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in December 2003.[CR]The game is known outside Japan as "Pochi and Nyaa".[CR]'Pochi' is a common name for a 'dog', and 'Nyaa' is the typical sound for a 'cat', so the title translates as 'Puppy and miaw'. The title is a pun : there is an extra char, so it can be read as 'Pochitto Nyaa', and Pochitto is the sound for a button quickly pressed.[CR]This game was out first out on the Sega Naomi hardware in 2002, and was ported to the SNK Neo-Geo MVS at the end of 2003 (but was not released on the Neo-Geo AES home console).[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Producer : Moo Niitani[CR]Sound Designer : Ichi, Moo Nya-Tani[CR]Instruction : Kashima Tadayuki[CR]Sound Produce : Tanaka Katumi[CR]Sound Direction and Design : Hayashi Kou (Oak-Sun Sound Design), Nagata Daisuke (Oak-Sun Sound Design), Hayashi Kou (Oak-Sun Sound Design), [CR]Voice Actor : Moo Nya-Tani, Kemi[CR]Development Cooperation : Oak-Sun Sound Design[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]Sony PlayStation 2 (2004)[CR]</plot>

Also the "evil character" versions of some characters are gone as well.[CR]* Newcomers in this game are : Li Xiangfei, Rick Strowd &amp; Alfred.[CR]A serious bug : Using a USA bios ROM if you insert a coin on the 'winners don't use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neogeo bios s1 tile-set rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the main-board z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attract loop after game-over, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Real Bout Garou Densetsu 2 The Newcomers / PCCB-00310) on April 17, 1998.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Fight against Alfred : Begin game play in single player mode, finish off the first 10 fights with no losses, score over 750000 by the time the 10th fight is won, land 5 P.POWER moves or 7 S.POWER moves. You will fight Alfred in a desert type stage.[CR]* You may scope out each character's best records by tapping A button to move forward or B button to move back at the score ranking screen :).[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

			<plot>Rage of the Dragons (c) 2002 Playmore Corp.[CR]Rage of the Dragons is an original fighting game with 14 selectable fighters plus Abubo (sub-boss, hidden character) and Johann (final boss).[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID: NGM-264[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-way Joystick[CR]Buttons: 4[CR]=&gt; [A] Weak Punch, [B] Weak Kick, [C] Strong Punch, [D] Strong Kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in June 2002, Rage of the Dragons is the first fighting game developed by Evoga Entertainment. This game is a collaboration between Evoga (Mexico), Brezza Soft (Japan) and Noise Factory (Japan).[CR]Evoga tried to make a new "Double Dragon" game and attempted to acquire the rights to "Double Dragon" from Technos Japan but they refused to sell. Without the proper rights to use the Double Dragon property, Evoga decided to do a game that pays homage to the Double Dragon series instead. For example, William 'Billy' Lewis, James 'Jimmy' Lewis and 'Abubo' are analogous to the characters Billy Lee, Jimmy Lee and Abobo from "Double Dragon". One funny thing about these Evoga characters is that they appear in Noise Factory's "Matrimeele", which is based on the Power Instinct series by Atlus.[CR]Pupa Salgueiro &amp; Cassandra Murata are the only characters in the game that have two super moves instead of just one. These being the Ultimate Quexada (for Pupa) and a ground version of the White Wave (for Cassandra).[CR]Linda, the famous lady with the whip in the Double Dragon games makes an appearance as one of Abubo's girlfriends in his intro pose as well as in the second Abubo cutscene.[CR]Alice Carroll's name seems curiously inspired in the famous children's book "Alice in Wonderland" and by the name of its author Lewis Carroll. Odd...[CR]Jones features many funny references to Bruce Lee such as his outfit (Bruce Lee's famous outfit in the 'Game of Death' movie), a few of his moves &amp; poses, and a suspicious quote in his ending! :)[CR]The stage of Radel and Annie is a night club called 'Noise Factory' just as one of the 3 companies which worked on the game.[CR]On the parking lot stage, there is a TV screen displaying credits for a movie. It contains Engrish text 'Special Sanks' instead of 'Special Thanks'.[CR]Noise Factory released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Rage of the Dragons Original Arrange Album) on 13/09/2002.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Abubo : at the character select screen, press quickly Up(x4), Down(x3), Left(x2), Right. A little melody indicates that the cheat worked and Abubo should appear on center.[CR]* The game encourages the use of team up attacks. In fact, by finishing each opponent with a team up attack will get you some nice grades &amp; a respectable score! (perfect lifebars with this tip will get you a handsome SSS grade every time!!!) :)[CR]* Jones' air version of his First Impact combo is broken against Alice since the last hit will always miss! Beware! :/[CR]* Johann, the last boss in the game cannot be dizzied since he lacks a dizzy animation, this can be seen by performing a team up attack on him. This makes this already cheap boss even harder to defeat! :/[CR]* After each battle, a rank is determined based on your fighting level. Here are the different levels and the bonus points awarded to the player if he reaches them :[CR]SSS : 100,000 points[CR]SS : 75,000 points[CR]S : 50,000 points[CR]A : 25,000 points[CR]B : 10,000 points[CR]C : 7,500 points[CR]D : 5,000 points[CR]E : 0 point[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Producer : Boss[CR]Directors : Angel Sword, Mamaro, Hidenari Mamoto[CR]Sub.

Players collect weapon powerups, bombs, and gold bars for points. Each plane has a unique 'supershot' which is charged by damaging enemies and fired by holding then releasing the fire button. Supershots can be stored, although the number varies from plane to plane. Using a Bomb results in a large friendly fighter swooping onto the screen and blocking shots while returning fire for a few seconds.[CR]After the player beats the final boss, the game starts again from the beginning, albeit at a much higher difficulty level.

To all of our customers, who have purchased NeoGeo rom cartridges up till now, thank you very much. We offer our most heartfelt gratitude for your loyal patronage over these 14 full years and hope for your continued support for our games on the many other platforms we will provide products for in the future.

Superb weapons-based fighter featuring 12 characters, bonus rounds and one end boss.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-045[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 4[CR]=&gt; With weapon : [A] Light attack, [B] Medium attack[CR]=&gt; Without weapon : [A] Light punch, [B] Medium punch, [C] Light kick, [D] Medium kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Samurai Spirits was released in July 1993 in Japan.[CR]The game is known outside Japan as 'Samurai Shodown'[CR]Samurai Spirits is the first game that introduced weapon fighting into the fighting game genre. The game used an upgraded version of the scaling graphics engine that was originally featured in "Art of Fighting".[CR]Samurai Spirits also started SNK's reputation for their unique style of Engrish, known as SNKgrish in their games.[CR]Unlike "Mortal Kombat", the usage of blood in this game is generally accepted, and the decision to replace blood with 'white blood' remains a sore point among fans of this series.[CR]Samurai Spirits is considered by some to portray Japanese culture and language effectively. Unlike most American versions of Japanese video games, the characters in this game (including the announcer) generally speak fluent Japanese with subtitles, and traditional Japanese music is often heard during gameplay. Samurai Shodown takes most of its characters from either historical sources or characters from the Ninja Scroll anime. In fact, a few designers that worked on Samurai Shodown also worked on the Ninja Scroll anime...[CR]Haohmaru is based on the legendary samurai Miyamoto Musashi (1584-1645), whose fighting philosophy heavily influenced that of the Haohmaru character.[CR]Ukyo Tachibana is Based on Sasaki Kojiro Genryu (1572-1612), Musashi's skilled rival.[CR]Jubei Yagyu is based on the historical Yagyu Jubei Mitsuyoshi (1606-1644), who was a sword instructor to the Tokugawa shogunate. The Yagyu clan was a famous clan of samurai.[CR]Hattori Hanzo Masashige (1541-1596) was the most famous of the Iga Ninja clan. He was a genius at leading night raids on forts and fiefs and became a feared assassin. Under his leadership, Iga Ninja became so notorious that Nobunaga felt it necessary to obliterate the Iga Ninja clan.[CR]Wan-Fu seems to be a combination of two famous Chinese warriors. The first is a famous Chinese swordsman who was a rebel during the Ch'ing Dynasty. His name was Wang Ts-bin Wu, but he became known as Da Dao Wang Wu ('Big Scimitar Wang Wu'). The second lead bases Wan Fu upon the ancient, almost legendary, founder of the Chou Dynasty, King Wu Wang.[CR]Kyoshiro Senryo is based on Nemuri Kyoshiro, a fictional character created by Shibata Tosaburo. 'Kyoshiro' translates to something like 'deranged fellow'. Tosaburo's Kyoshiro had nothing to do with kabuki theater as does Samurai Shodown Kyoshiro. Kyoshiro's weapon is called a naginata.[CR]Charlotte is based on a character in the manga 'The Rose of Versailles' by Riyoko Ikeda (1972).[CR]Gen-an Shiranui looks much like Mushizo, the hunchback demon of Ninja Scroll. Gen-an's weapon is modeled after the weapon wielded by Shijima, the shadow demon, from Ninja Scroll. Although they share a surname, Gen-an is not a relative of Mai Shiranui of the Fatal Fury/King of Fighters series.[CR]Amakusa Shiro Tokisada (1622-1638) led a Christian uprising against the Tokugawa shogunate in the Shimabara region of Japan.[CR]Nakoruru is a homage to Sailor Moon.[CR]A 'Kuroko' is a traditional Kabuki theater stagehand. They are traditionally dressed in black and took care of scenery and other behind-the-scenes needs during a Kabuki performance, just like modern theater stagehands. In the case of Samurai Shodown, Kuroko is the referee for each match in Samurai Shodown I and II. The black strip of fabric hanging over a Kuroko's face is to signify that they are not part of the Kabuki performance, just helping with the props. The red and white flags that Kuroko has are used in traditional martial arts matches, where each successful hit gets the corresponding fighter's flag raised.[CR]Mai Shiranui (of Fatal Fury) appears in Haohmaru's and Gen-An's endings.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Samurai Spirits - PCCB-00135) on 17/09/1993.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Alternate Costume Colors : Highlight a fighter at the character selection screen and press D.[CR]* Sleeping Mamahaha : This is just hilarious! To see this while playing as Nakoruru simply stand still, after a 8 secs or so Mamahaha will land on Nakoruru's shoulder, start yawning and then it will fall asleep![CR]* Poppy's Puppies : To see a truly cool &amp; funny secret pose with Galford, Get a PERFECT against an opponent while unarmed. You must finish the battle with anything except a throw though![CR]* Tam Tam's Broken Ending : If you use continues while beating the game with Tam Tam, you will miss a part of the whole ending (You can't see his real face). Beat the game with one credit in order to see his face.[CR]* Wan-fu's Sword Explosion Bug : While playing as Wan-fu trap an enemy against the edge of the screen then perform the Explosive Sword Drop with the B button (HCB + B) to throw the sword and land next to the opponent. Since most players as well as the CPU are likely to block the move, crouch and hit them with the C button (a short kick). This will make the move unblockable and causes tons of damage![CR]* Cut-proof Characters? : Sometimes a finishing slash will cut most opponents in half, however some characters (these being Kyoshiro &amp; Amakusa) cannot be cut in half![CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

Continuing the aesthetic tradition and high quality of the very successful series featuring 12 selectable characters to fight Zankuro, a very powerful demon samurai.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : 0087[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2610 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 4[CR]=&gt; [A] Light attack with weapon, [B] Medium attack with weapon, [C] Strong attack with weapon, [D] Kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Samurai Spirits - Zankurou Musouken was released in October 1995 in Japan. Literally 'Samurai Spirits - Zankuro's Matchless Sword'.[CR]This game is known outside Japan as 'Samurai Shodown III' and in Korea as "Fighters Swords". The full US name for the game is "Samurai Shodown III - Blades of Blood".[CR]Kafuin Gaira is a Buddhist monk whose weapons are giant 'mala', or Buddhist prayer beads. When Gaira wins the first round of a match, he throws a few punches and says 'Tenchu!', which means 'retribution!'. Gaira says a traditional Buddhist prayer for his fallen opponent when he wins the final round of the match. 'Namu amida butsu', Gaira's prayer, is basically 'go to heaven' or 'rest in peace'.[CR]Shizumaru Hisame is a homage to Himura Kenshin (a character from the manga 'Rurouni Kenshin').[CR]Zankuro Minazuki is a homage to Raijyuta Isurugi (another character from 'Rurouni Kenshin').[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Zankuro : This tip only works in 2-Player mode.

Galford will say, 'Arigato!' as the puppies[CR]scamper across the screen.[CR]* I'm Not Afraid Of You! : think you are really good? Tap START 3 times quickly to make your character drop his/her sword. Now show your opponents that the most fearsome weapons are the ones you were born with! Note : a few characters are really hampered by the loss of weapon (e.g. Haohmaru, Kazuki, Sogetsu) and a few are not really affected (Nakoruru, Rimururu, Hanzo).[CR]* Sepukku (Suicide) : press Back, then move your joystick a quarter circle from forwards to down and press START to make your character kill himself/herself and lose the current round (Useless trick? Not quite since you will start the next round with a full rage gauge!).[CR]* Silly Name Trick : now this is weird!

			<plot>Samurai Spirits Zero (c) 2003 SNK Playmore.[CR]A 5th episode of the Samurai Shodown saga on Neo-Geo with 24 selectable characters plus Poppy (secret character) plus 3 bosses (Sankuro the mid-boss, Yumeji the sub-boss and the general Gaoh as final boss).[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-270[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 4[CR]=&gt; [A] Light attack, [B] Medium attack, [C] Kick/Break defence, [D] Lie down/Forward roll/Back roll/Small jump/Dodge[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Samurai Spirits Zero was released in October 2003 in Japan. Called ZERO because its story takes place before the first Samurai Spirits episode.[CR]This game is known outside Japan as Samurai Shodown V.[CR]Parts of Shiki's personality are homages to Rei Ayanami (a character from Evangelion) and Mugen no Jyuunin. As a matter of fact, one of her winquotes was taken word-for-word from a quote in Evangelion.[CR]Rera first appeared in a Nakoruru OVA titled 'Nakoruru - Ano hito kara no okurimono'.[CR]Sankuro's name and moves (which call out his henchmen), collectively, contain all the digits from one to nine.[CR]Yumeji's attacks are all borrowed from other characters (for most of them, she morphs into the character she is borrowing the move from). Her Shin Musou Ittou-ryuu Kagerou and Shin Musou Ittou-ryuu Sasame Yuki - Sen are all borrowed from Ukyo's Bust moves in SS4 (Ukyo only has his Slash moves from SS4 in SS5). She also borrows : Charlotte's Bayonette Lunge, Genjuro's Sanren Satsu, Hanzo's Ninpou Mozu Otoshi, Haohmaru's Ougi - Kogetsu Zan, Jubei's Yagyu Shingan Tou - Souha, Kyoshiro's Choubi Jishi, Nakoruru's Annu Mutsube, Rimururu's Rupush Kamui Weison Pekoru, Ukyo's Hiken Tsubame Gaeshi, Yoshitora's Yon no Tachi - Tsubaki.[CR]The creator of the manga 'Rurouni Kenshin', Nobuhiro Watsuki, helped to make 'Yoshitora Tokugawa'. Nobuhiro Watsuki has declared many times his love for the Samurai Spirits video-games. You can find some characters in his work strictly copied from these series.[CR]Card game : In December 2006, Sabertooth Games released a Samurai Shodown V collectable card game set for it's Universal Fighting System (UFS) game.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]If you put the game in 'Japan territory' via the MVS bios setting, the story mode will be completed by little scenes of dialogs between the different characters.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Costume Color Select : everyone has four outfit colors chosen by A, B, C or D. The (D) button ones seem to be the oddest ones.[CR]* Play as Poppy : on the character select screen highlight 'Kazuki' and then move Left, Right, Left(x2), Right(x2), Left(x2), Right and then button A to select (use buttons B to D instead for different colors).[CR]* I'm Not Afraid Of You! : think you are really good? Tap Start 3 times quickly to make your character drop his/her sword. Now show your opponents that the most fearsome weapons are the ones you were born with![CR]* Secret Win Pose : if you get a Perfect win in the second round with Galford, one of Poppy's puppies will show up and run forward, only to stumble and land on it's stomach.[CR]* Pursuit Reset : pick Jubei and perform a Big Pursuit when unarmed (press Up+B+C when your opponent is down). The game will reset.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Samurai Spirits [Model NGM-045] (1993)[CR]2. Shin Samurai Spirits - Haohmaru Jigoku Hen [Model NGM-063] (1994)[CR]3.

The game was known outside Japan as Savage Reign (released one month later, on May 25, 1995).[CR]The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Wind and Cloud Apocalypse - Hand-to-Hand Fighting Genesis'). 'Mokushiroku' is Japanese for the Christian book of Revelation, also known as the Apocalypse. 'Sousei' is Japanese for 'creation of the world', or 'genesis'. 'Sousei' and 'Mokushiroku' are diametrically opposed, just like 'Genesis' and 'Apocalypse' - and used here as a metaphor for the conflict between Syo Hayate and Shishi-Oh (King Lion).[CR]'Fu'un' in the series actually refers to the fighting style of the main character, Syo Hayate.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Fu'un Mokushiroku - Kakutou Sousei - PCCB-00181) on June 21, 1995.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]In the Japanese version :[CR]* King Lion is named Kage Shishioh.[CR]* King Leo is named Shin Shishioh.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

In this game you take control of a team and must beat all other teams (you can even recruit the other team's leader after beating them!) in order to face the  current Dodge Ball champion and take the title.

In the overhead map at the beginning of each match, all characters are drawn in a comical small body style, apparently as an homage of the famous NES games that featured the River City Ransom characters.[CR]Kunio appears in "Renegade" / "Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-Kun" as main characters.[CR]After the release of this game, Technos Japan went bankrupt (December 15, 95). Since the licenses of Kunio-Kun and Dodge-Ball had a great values in the 90's, former Technos Japan staff established a new company.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The International versions of this game are almost identical to the Japanese version (no voice cuts as in the Magical Drop games), only the title screen is completely different &amp; the fact that Shinji's taunt is censored outside Japan (Instead of merely shaking his fist angrily at his opponents, Shinji gives them the middle finger!).[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Characters turn VERY slowly in this game, this means that you can score free hits if you either run past them and smack them with the ball, or pass the ball to a teammate that has already been defeated![CR]* Beat the game without continuing to see a special screen after the credits with all the characters grouped together.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

			<plot>Shock Troopers - 2nd Squad (c) 1998 SNK.[CR]More of an update than a full-blown sequel, Shock Troopers - 2nd Squad picks up where the first game - released a year earlier - left off. Once again, one or two players face the might of a terrorist army who are threatening to destroy the world by launching a newly developed weapon-of-mass-destruction if their wishes - to be given absolute control of the newly-founded nation of Billberk - aren't granted.[CR]Like many Neo Geo sequels, 2nd Squad doesn't particularly do anything the original didn't do. There are some improvements, however; graphics have been given a brush up and level design is a little more imaginative than that of the already impressive original.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : 0246[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2610 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 320 x 224 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 59.19 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 4096[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3 =&gt; [A] Shot attack/Close range attack, [B] Bomb attack, [C] Jump/Get in a vehicle/Get out a vehicle[CR]=&gt; Leon &gt; [A] Spread shot/Combat knife, [B] Power napalm[CR]=&gt; Angel &gt; [A] Front shot/Tear gus, [B] Wide napalm[CR]=&gt; Lulu &gt; [A] Wide shot/Revolver, [B] Normal bomb[CR]=&gt; Toy &gt; [A] Laser shot/Stan gun, [B] Sonic bomb[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Developed by Saurus.[CR]Released in October 1998.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Shock Troopers Second Squad, Shock Troopers - PCCB-00355) on 01/1999.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]Here are the 4 characters with their codenames and statistics :[CR]* Leon (aka Lion Heart) : Speed 1 - Attack 4 - Defense 4 - Evasion 1[CR]* Angel (aka Ceramic Arms) : Speed 2 - Attack 3 - Defense 2 - Evasion 3[CR]* Lulu (aka Lightning Eyes) : Speed 4 - Attack 1 - Defense 1 - Evasion 3[CR]* Toy (aka Ice Brain) : Speed 3 - Attack 2 - Defense 3 - Evasion 2[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

			<plot>Shock Troopers (c) 1997 SNK.[CR]Shock Troopers pits the players against a mighty terrorist group who are holding a girl hostage, in order to force her grandfather to surrender a powerful drug which will enable the terrorists to control the minds of the grandfather's soldiers and create a huge, unstoppable army.[CR]Shock Troopers is a multi-directional scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players that builds upon the foundations laid by Capcom's 1985 classic, "Commando (Capcom)" and also borrows heavily from Commando's sequel, '"Mercs". As well as enemy troops, players must contend with tanks, choppers and assorted military vehicles, and must also be careful to avoid any of the landmines that litter the levels. Extra weapons and health can be picked up from destroyed enemy vehicles, as well as being found in enemy supply crates. Shock Troopers is effectively three games in one as players can chose one of three different routes; each made up of different levels. The game also offers greater variety of gameplay than other of the genre; with levels having the players travel on the back of fast moving vehicles, climbing a rock face etc.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : 0238[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2610 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 4[CR]=&gt; [A] Shot/Close range attack, [B] Evasive Maneuver, [C] Special attack, [D] Change player (in team battle mode only)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Developed by Saurus.[CR]Released in November 1997.[CR]This game runs on the Neo-Geo MVS but was not released on the Neo-Geo AES home console.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Shock Troopers Second Squad, Shock Troopers - PCCB-00355) on 01/1999.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

			<plot>Sonic Wings 2 (c) 1994 Video System.[CR]The first sequel to the superb vertically scrolling shoot-em-up "Sonic Wings", players once again take control of a Jet fighter aircraft and take to the skies to destroy enemy jets, boats, helicopters, gun emplacements and huge end-of-level bosses. The graphics are every bit as accomplished as those of the prequel and the game delivers a good level of challenge.[CR]The end-of-level bosses change from game-to-game; a nice touch that adds variety to an already solid game.[CR]Players can choose to play as any one of eight different fighter pilots, each of which pilots a different jet :[CR]* American F-117A Nighthawk piloted by Robo-Keaton. [CR]* American A-10 Thunderbolt II piloted by Mao Mao. [CR]* Japanese Fighter-Support X piloted by Hien. [CR]* Japanese F-15 Eagle piloted by Captain Silver.

This game is known outside Japan as Aero Fighters 2.[CR]This represents the second game in the Sonic Wings series and the first one on the Neo-Geo MVS.[CR]The game's storyline changes according to the pilots currently selected, this applies to the endings as well. So try out different pair combinations in order to see some truly wacky endings![CR]In one part of the city in the Japan stage, you can see Red Rabbit (from "Rabio Lepus") on a sign, a poster of Mao Mao, a small sign with Mambu on it, and of course that infamous 'Heroin Magic' sign. Also, Check out the theme park in the U.S.A. stage. Among the rides, you can see the Red Rabbit, Tenukie, and Mambu.[CR]There are three last bosses in the game, but they appear randomly. The most common one is Lar, a giant black sphere with an eye. The second rarest one is Tenukii, a white sheet ghost. And the third and most difficult to get is Mambu, a giant sunfish. You can get three bad endings if you let the last bosses escape.[CR]There are a total of 47 endings in the game. Eight are for the individual character endings, twenty-eight are for the team endings, three are for the bad endings and eight for beating the 2nd loop with each character.[CR]The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table.

			<plot>Sonic Wings 3 (c) 1995 Video System.[CR]The third game in this excellent series adheres to the solid shoot-em-up template set down by its predecessors. The player takes on the role of a Jet Fighter aircraft pilot whose mission is to combat world terrorism. The object of the game is to fly from country to country and destroy all opposition around the world, before flying into outer space to combat the menace responsible for the terrorism. Each pilot has his own storyline that ties in with the game.[CR]One enemy shot destroys the player's plane and releases a special power-up that the plane may have been carrying. If the player's final ship is destroyed, all power-ups and extra bombs are released and can be collected if the player chooses the 'continue' option, or if a second player is still active. However, on the final mission in Outer Space, the player is forced to start again at the beginning of the space mission, unless 2 players are active.[CR]Sonic Wings now features an array of 10 selectable pilots :[CR]American Vought F4U Corsair piloted by Robo-Keaton.

			<plot>SVC Chaos - SNK Vs. Capcom (c) 2003 Playmore Corp.[CR]A one-on-one fighting game - the collaboration between Capcom and SNK - pits seventeen well-known SNK combatants against seventeen of Capcom's most famous game characters.[CR]'SVC Chaos' primarily utilizes the command system of the "King of Fighters" series, incorporating light/strong kicks, punches, cancels and charging attacks. Unlike its predecessor, however, "Capcom vs. SNK 2", SvC features no air guards and lacks a 'groove system', instead focusing on quicker game play and online competition.[CR]Each character is equipped with a basic three-bar system for executing 'Exceeds' (special attacks), with basic filling options attributed to strikes and damage. Additionally, the sprites from the various series received new models and some special effects were changed in the command lists (For example, the player can no longer increase the damage of the 'Zujou Sashi' used by Choi Bounge by tapping the buttons).[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-269[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 4[CR]=&gt; [A] Weak punch [B] Weak kick [C] Strong punch [D] Strong kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in July 2003.[CR]Here are the 17 SNK characters (plus Evil Mr Karate) and their first appearance in video games :[CR]Athena Asamiya - "Athena"[CR]Choi Bounge - "The King of Fighters '94"[CR]Earthquake - "Samurai Shodown" ("Samurai Spirits" in Japan)[CR]Iori Yagami - "The King of Fighters '95"[CR]Kasumi Todoh - "Art of Fighting 3 - The Path of the Warrior" ("Ryuuko no Ken Gaiden" in Japan)[CR]Kim Kaphwan - "Fatal Fury 2" ("Garou Densetsu 2 - Arata-Naru Tatakai" in Japan)[CR]Kyo Kusanagi - "The King of Fighters '94"[CR]Geese Howard - "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" ("Garou Densetsu - Shukumei no Tatakai" in Japan)[CR]Genjyuro Kibagami - "Samurai Shodown II" ("Samurai Spirits II" in Japan)[CR]Goenitz - "The King of Fighters '96"[CR]Mai Shiranui - "Fatal Fury 2" ("Garou Densetsu 2 - Arata-Naru Tatakai" in Japan)[CR]Mars People - "Metal Slug - Super Vehicle-001"[CR]Mr Karate - "Art of Fighting 2" ("Ryuuko no Ken 2" in Japan) as Takuma Takazaki[CR]Orochi Iori - "The King of Fighters '97"[CR]Ryo Sakazaki - "Art of Fighting" ("Ryuuko no Ken" in Japan)[CR]Shiki - "Samurai Shodown 64" ("Samurai Spirits 64" in Japan)[CR]Terry Bogard - "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" ("Garou Densetsu - Shukumei no Tatakai" in Japan)[CR]There are also 17 Capcom characters (plus Shin Akuma) and here are their first appearances:[CR]Akuma (Gouki in Japan) - "Super Street Fighter II Turbo" ("Super Street Fighter II X" in Japan)[CR]Balrog (M. Bison in Japan) - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"[CR]Chun-Li - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"[CR]Dan Hibiki - "Street Fighter Alpha - Warriors' Dreams" ("Street Fighter Zero" in Japan)[CR]Demitri -  "Darkstalkers - The Night Warriors" ("Vampire - The Night Warriors" in Japan)[CR]Dhalsim - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"[CR]Guile - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"[CR]Hugo - "Final Fight"[CR]Ken Masters - "Street Fighter"[CR]M.

SNK 2 - Mark of the Millenium 2001".[CR]Bao (from the King of Fighters series) makes a cameo in a few of Hugo's pre-battle and win poses.[CR]The Athena that features in SVC Chaos is the original Athena character design that featured in the character's debut platform game, "Athena", instead of the usual Asimaya Athena that appears in virtually every other SNK game. Notably, a lot of her moves are now very different, and she wears noticeably less clothes due to the fact Athena loses her dress during Athena's intro. Athena's fighting moves are inspired by the manga/anime 'Saint Seiya'.[CR]The 'Sennou Ken' character is based on the psycho-controlled Ken in the SF animated movie. A lot of Mars People's moves are references to numerous UFO-based staples; Independence is a reference to the movie 'Independence Day', for example.[CR]The 'Dan Hibiki' character is once again used as a vehicle for numerous genre parodies. If you perform his super-taunt he parodies Joe Higashi and Yuri Sakazaki's taunts. Also, two of his new moves are parodies of the Kyokugen moves. In the first of these moves, Dan attempts to do one of the larger fireballs performed in one Ryo's desperation move, but it has the same range as his regular fireball. On the second move, Dan attempts to perform his own powerful punch similar to Ryo's Exceed move, but after the move charges and connects Dan grabs his arm in pain and then pretends it was nothing.[CR]While using Demitri, if you perform Midnight Bliss on Orochi Iori, Iori will turn into Miss X (from SNK Gal Fighters on the Neo Geo Pocket) as he's choking him.[CR]Suleputer released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game on November 2003.[CR]Some well-known hacks of the game include :[CR]"SVC Chaos - SNK Vs. Capcom Plus".[CR]"SVC Chaos - SNK Vs. Capcom Super Plus".[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Random Select : On the character select screen, hold Start to activate a roulette-like feature.[CR]* Play as Geese : Hold Start and press Left(x3), Down, Left, Up, Right, Up, then press a button to select.[CR]* Play as Dan : Hold Start and press Down, Left(x7), then press a button to select.[CR]* Play as Goenitz : Hold Start and press Down(x3), Right, Down, Left(x3), then press a button to select.[CR]* Play as Demitri : Hold Start and press Right(x3), Left, Up, Right, Down, Up, then press a button to select.[CR]* Play as Mars People : Hold Start and press Up, Down, Right(x3), Up, Down, Left(x2), Down, then press a button to select.[CR]* Play as Zero : Hold Start and press Up, Right(x2), Left(x2), Down, Up(x3), Right, then press a button to select.[CR]* Play as Orochi Iori : Hold Start and press Up(x3), Down, Left, Right, Down, Left, then press a button to select.[CR]* Play as Violent Ken : Hold Start and press Up(x2), Down, Left(x2), Right, Left, Up, then press a button to select.[CR]* Fight against Red Arremer :[CR]1) Finish 5 rounds with supers/specials.[CR]2) Do not lose any rounds.[CR]3) Finish off at least one character with block damage.[CR]If done correctly, your character will be transported to Hell after the fight with Shin Akuma/Shin Mr. Karate, where he/she will have to fight Red Arremer.

Your performance in Stage 8 will not affect any of these conditions.[CR]* See character's true/good ending : Defeat Athena or Red Arremer in Stage 9. If you lose to Athena or Red Arremer then you cannot continue. Many characters (such as Dan and Demitri) have different endings for beating either Athena or Red Arremer.[CR]* CPU Character Patterns : before you start the game the CPU randomly picks one of the predetermined patterns of opponents. This affects stages 1 through 3 and 5 &amp; 6. Stage 4 is the predetermined mid-boss. Here are the predetermined pattern of fighters.[CR]Pattern 1 : Kim, Dhalsim, Mai, Bison, Kyo[CR]Pattern 2 : Vega, Earthquake, Chun-Li, Choi, Ryo[CR]Pattern 3 : Shiki, Balrog, Kasumi, Sagat, Iori[CR]Pattern 4 : Guile, Genjyuro, Tessa, Kim, Ken[CR]Pattern 5 : Tessa, Sagat, Mr. Karate, Chun-Li, Ryo[CR]Pattern 6 : Chun-Li, Kasumi, Hugo, Mr. Karate, Guile[CR]Pattern 7 : Mr. Karate, Hugo, Shiki, Dhalsim, Terry[CR]Pattern 8 : Choi, Mai, Vega, Genjyuro, Akuma[CR]Pattern 9 : Kasumi, Chun-Li, Shiki, Tessa, Mai[CR]Pattern 10 : Earthquake, Vega, Akuma, Ken, Ryu[CR]Pattern 11 : Dhalsim, Hugo, Kyo, Balrog, Iori[CR]Pattern 12 : Iori, Guile, Bison, Kim, Ken[CR]Pattern 13 : Ryu, Balrog, Kim, Sagat, Ryo[CR]Pattern 14 : Terry, Choi, Earthquake, Genjyuro, Guile[CR]Pattern 15 : Kyo, Ken, Ryo, Ryu, Terry[CR]Pattern 16 : Balrog, Vega, Sagat, Bison, Akuma[CR]So let's say the CPU randomly chooses Pattern 16 (which interesting enough follows the boss pattern of Street Fighter II plus Akuma), you would fight Balrog, Vega, and Sagat in stages 1 through 3, fight the mid-boss in stage 4, fight Bison and Akuma in stages 5 through 6, and then fight Orochi Iori and Serious Mr. Karate in stages 7 through 8 (since the stage 6 opponent was a Capcom character).[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

This doesn&#8217;t feature laps but is a point-to-point race, with each stage having to be completed within a set time limit. In addition to the six rally cars of the World Rally mode, the Paris-to-Dakar Rally also allows players to race in either a buggy, a motorbike, or a truck.[CR]All tracks feature a variety of different road surfaces, such as snow, gravel, sand or water.

Nazca was formed by Irem ex members, which is the reason why Neo Turf Masters adopts many of the graphic and gameplay aspects of Irem's "Major Title" series.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Random Selection : Press A+B+C+D at the player selection AND/OR the course selection screen.[CR]* Here are the different golfers we can select with their country and their statistics :[CR]Young Hero (USA) : Driving 3 - Accuracy 3 - Skill 3 - Recovery 3 - Putting 3[CR]Technician (United Kingdom) : Driving 2 - Accuracy 4 - Skill 5 - Recovery 4 - Putting 3[CR]Veteran (Australia) : Driving 1 - Accuracy 2 - Skill 4 - Recovery 5 - Putting 2[CR]Shot Maker (Germany) : Driving 4 - Accuracy 5 - Skill 2 - Recovery 2 - Putting 4[CR]Power Golfer (Brazil) : Driving 5 - Accuracy 1 - Skill 1 - Recovery 1 - Putting 1[CR]Putt Master (Japan) : Driving 3 - Accuracy 2 - Skill 4 - Recovery 2 - Putting 5[CR]* Sometimes contests appear during a circuit :[CR]1) The closest to the pin contest : you have to hit the ball as close as possible to the hole in one hit. If the ball gets closer to the pin than the previous record, you will earn a bonus hole.[CR]2) The longest driving contest : you have to shoot the ball as far as possible in one hit. If you exceed the previous record, you will earn a bonus hole.[CR]* The order from the best to the worst performance is :[CR]Albatros (3 hits less than for a Par)[CR]Eagle (2 hits less than for a Par)[CR]Birdie (1 hit less than for a Par)[CR]Par (the average level)[CR]Bogey (1 hit more than for a Par)[CR]Double Bogey (2 hits more than for a Par)[CR]Triple Bogey (3 hits more than for a Par)[CR]If you miss the attempt to make a Triple Bogey, you will have to give up the hole and will suffer an additional penalty.[CR]If the ball arrives out of bound or in the water, you will be penalized one stroke.[CR]* You CAN apply spin to the ball, forward or back. Neo Turf Masters requires two taps on the keypad to strike the ball. The first tap determines power, the second tap determines loft. After the first tap and before the second, push up or down on the joystick. You can get a wicked backspin on the ball. You can also forward spin through the wind, or land short and roll nicely up a hill.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Neo Turf Masters (1996)[CR]2.

			<plot>Twinkle Star Sprites (c) 1997 SNK.[CR]Twinkle Star Sprites is a competitive scrolling shooter game originally created by ADK. It was ADK's last production for the Neo-Geo platform. The gameplay, which can be characterized as a combination of a fixed shooter and a versus puzzle game, uses combinations of shots, as well as timed power-ups to attempt to damage the opponent. These attacks also serve as counters to the opponent's attack.[CR]An interesting &amp; highly cute hybrid between a Vs style puzzle game &amp; an overhead shooter, players may choose to play the Story Mode in order to see the misadventures of Load Ran &amp; her faithful yet somewhat annoying Rabbicat as they try to find the Magical Twinkle Star &amp; save their world from the evil Mevious &amp; his henchmen. The other option is to play the Free Character Mode in which you are able to pick any character (see codes under Tips and Tricks) to play the game and see their very own comical ending. A second player may challenge you at any time.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : 0224[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2610 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2b[A] Shoot/Use attack-stopper, [B] Bomb[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Twinkle Star Sprites was released in January 1997.[CR]The game's concept seems to be a funny parody of the Sailor Moon manga, however the game's comic relief 'Rabbicat' seems to be a parody of Tenchi Muyo's very own cute mascot &amp; comic relief 'Ryo-Oh-Ki' the cabbit.[CR]Load Ran &amp; Sprites feature different endings in the Free Character Mode, these endings are completely different to the one seen in the Story Mode.[CR]In the story mode, Mevious will either taunt or praise you if continues have been used during your game or not![CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Twinkle Star Sprites - PCCB-00247) on 21/02/1997.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]There are two types of standard attacks: a normal shot and a charge-up shot. Each character starts with two bombs which enables him in the event of desperate plight, to clean with the screen while briefly acquiring a state of invincibility. The two players' playfields are separated by a vertical bar, each one having its own independent of the other. Series of enemies arrive from the top of the screen. The player is to successfully destroy them in chains (combos), which will send one or more fireball projectiles to the screen of his adversary (Normal Attack). Shooting at Normal Attacks several times reflects them back as glowing Reverse Attacks. If Reverse Attacks are reflected again, a number of powerful counterattacks in the shape of one or more indestructible enemies appear (Extra Attack). Reflecting many Reverse Attacks at once can instead summon a boss (Boss Attack).[CR]* The Extra Attacks and the Boss Attack vary from one character to another.[CR]* The power gauge fills as the player destroys enemies up to three levels. By holding down the fire button and releasing when a certain level is reached, the player can launch a character-specific charge shot to assist the player in clearing enemies from his screen. At Level 1, the charge shot is launched. At Level 2, the charge shot and three Extra Attacks against the opponent are launched. At Level 3 (Max Level), the charge shot and a Boss Attack are launched. Firing charge shots at Level 2 and above will decrease the power gauge.[CR]* 30&#8211;40 seconds into a round, a blue orb appears among a chain of enemies. If this orb is destroyed in a chain, the player achieves Fever status for the next several seconds. Chains created during Fever generate faster and more plentiful Normal Attacks per enemy destroyed, which can prove to be very dangerous to the opponent if large chains are made.[CR]* Both players are given five life points at the start of a round.[CR]* Colliding into an enemy costs 1 life point, but the player cannot be killed this way; if a player has one life point left, he will be left with one half of a life point. When this happens, his character is stunned for a short while and is reduced in speed and attack power for several seconds after recovery, all the while left more vulnerable to opponent attacks.[CR]* Getting hit by a Normal Attack, Reverse Attack, Extra Attack or the projectiles from a Boss cost 3 life points.[CR]    [CR]* The match is over when a player loses all his life points.[CR]* When a player takes damage, his opponent recovers life points equal to half of the damage taken.[CR]* If a round lasts longer than 100 seconds or the player does not fire a shot for more than 30 seconds, a Death enemy appears. If a player is hit by this enemy, he will lose immediately (Death Attack). The Death can be destroyed as any other enemy, but always comes back, harder to kill. Additionally, if a player is successful in volleying the "death" character over to his opponent's side, and the death character touches the opponent, the opponent dies instantly. This is a possible, though difficult, way to win. This, of course, would require the player to be skilled enough to avoid obstacles and not fire for more than 30 seconds.[CR]* Special Codes:[CR]Play As Sprites : At the character select screen, put the selector on Ran and press Up(x4), A.[CR]Play As Memory : At the character select screen, put the selector on Ran and press Down(x4), A.[CR]Play As Mevious : At the character select screen, put the selector on Griffon and press Up(x4), A.[CR]Play As Dark Ran : At the character select screen, put the selector on Griffon and press Down(x4), A.[CR]* After the Game Over screen, Load Ran &amp; Rabbicat rate your performance and either praise you or give you advice to improve your score, get a very high score (1,000.000 and above) in order to attain the highest rating and make Load Ran blush.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Developed by ADK.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]SNK Neo-Geo CD [JP] (Feb.1997) "Twinkle Star Sprites [Model ADCD-013]"[CR]Sega Saturn [JP] (Dec.1997) "Twinkle Star Sprites [Model T-37301G]"[CR]Sega Dreamcast [JP] (Mar.2000) "Twinkle Star Sprites [Model T-3103M]"[CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [JP] (Dec.2008) "ADK Tamashii [Model SLPS-25906]"[CR]</plot>

			<plot>World Heroes (c) 1992 Alpha Denshi Company, Limited.[CR]8 heroes from different time periods compete to thwart Geegus, the evil alien end boss! Includes an extremely fun and unique death match mode![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-053[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; [A] Punch, [B] Kick, [C] Throw[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]World Heroes was released on July 28, 1992. It is Alpha Denshi's first game in the fighting game genre. It was even the last game with the Alpha logo labeled within the game before the developer became ADK; however, the Alpha logo was last used on one of the arcade flyers of its sequel.[CR]Due to the game's success in the fighting game market, the game was followed by a sequel, World Heroes 2, less than a year later.[CR]The popular "Death Match" mode (removed from World Heroes 2 Jet and World Heroes Perfect) may have been inspired by the growing popularity of deathmatch style pro-wrestling in Japan at the time which was mostly made famous by Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling.[CR]Hanzo is based on the real Hanzo Hattori Musashige (just like Hanzo in "Samurai Shodown").[CR]Fuuma is based on the real Kotaro Fuuma Nobuyuki (1581-1603).[CR]Kim Dragon is Alpha Denshi's homage to Bruce Lee (1940-1973).[CR]Janne is based on the real Jeanne d'Arc who was burned in 1431.[CR]Rasputin is based on the real Gregoriy Yefimovich Rasputin (1869-1917).[CR]Brocken is loosely based on Rudolph von Stroheim from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.[CR]Muscle Power is most likely based on the real Hulk Hogan (1953-20XX).[CR]J. Carn is based on the real Genghis Khan (1162-1229).[CR]The first World Heroes game is also the only game in the series where Kim Dragon is Chinese. He was then changed into a South Korean character for the rest of the World Heroes series.[CR]The name of the Scientist who invents the time machine in the intro is Dr. Brown which might have been inspired by the character Dr. Emmett L. Brown (a.k.a. Doc) from the Back To The Future movies.[CR]Soundtrack releases:[CR][JP] Jan. 21, 1993 - World Heroes [GSM 1500 Series] [PCCB-00106][CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

			<plot>Zupapa! (c) 2001 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].[CR]In this whimsical action game, you take control of an uber cute, long-eared, boxing-gloves wearing hero and his 4 little sidekicks (called 'Zooks' by the way!) in order to tackle colorful yet dangerous enemies in fun looking worlds such as Nightmare Land, Circus Land, Toy Land, Jungle Land, Dino Land, Japan Land, Sci-fi Land, Dragon Land &amp; Virtual Land! Features very colorful graphics, nicely animated characters, fun bonus stages to mix things up and a simple yet really catchy soundtrack! Grab a friend for some truly awesome platforming fun![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-070[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]=&gt; [A] Punch/Toss Zooks, [B] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]This game runs on the SNK Neo-Geo MVS hardware and was not released on the Neo-Geo AES home console.[CR]On February 22, 1994, SNK third party developer Face debuted Zupapa at the AOU Show in Japan, however the game was released by SNK for its MVS system in 2001. That is the reason the game was long thought to be a prototype-only title! So far, this is the only NeoGeo un-released prototype game that finally saw an actual official release.[CR]The game was finally released a few months after the 'success' of "Nightmare in the Dark" (because they are very similar, only graphics and levels change). They are so close that some players consider that Nightmare in the Dark is the adult version of the game (with dark graphics) and Zupapa the children version (with its cute animations).[CR]This is one of the very few Neo Geo games that does not show the names of its developers at the ending, it also deems this title as Episode 1 but chances of a sequel are next to none! Too bad... :([CR]Default highscore table (RANKING) :[CR]RANK NAME SCORE[CR]1st KAT 100000[CR]2nd GON 80000[CR]3rd OKI 60000[CR]4th SET 40000[CR]5th HAR 20000[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* You can find a few power-ups in the different levels :[CR]S : Increase Zupapa's speed.[CR]P : Increase Zupapa's power.[CR]J : Add points whenever Zupapa jumps.[CR]A : Add points whenever Zupapa punches.[CR]X2 : Double the score of all score items.[CR]* Destroy all enemies in any stage with a single Zook Bomb in order to be rewarded with a golden Zupapa trophy![CR]* Do not throw the Zooks if you do not need to, otherwise they will run away from you making the current stage more tricky to clear![CR]* After clearing the first world, when you start playing in the second world, at the end of each round when you've killed all the enemies, you are given a few seconds before being warped to the next stage. During this time you can keep jumping or pushing the punch button. Every time you push any of the buttons, you are awarded 100 points. Quite good for making high-score rewards.[CR]* When you throw those small kids at the enemies and they are out cold for a few seconds, try to kill them by touching them when several other enemies are in the needed radius, this will of course kill that enemy but also kill the others in the certain radius and you'll get extra fruits hence bonus.[CR]* Beat the game without continuing to see an extra congratulatory image in the ending.[CR]</plot>
