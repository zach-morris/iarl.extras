				<emu_comment>Internet Archive MAME Romset 0.185 CHD Games List by Zach Morris.  This list contains a list of all available CHD MAME games.[CR]MAME (an acronym of Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator) is an emulator application designed to recreate the hardware of arcade game systems in software on modern personal computers and other platforms.  The intention is to preserve gaming history by preventing vintage games from being lost or forgotten. The aim of MAME is to be a reference to the inner workings of the emulated arcade machines; the ability to actually play the games is considered "a nice side effect".  Joystiq has listed MAME as an application that every gamer should have.</emu_comment>

				<plot>FireFox (c) 1983 Atari.[CR]You pilot the fastest, most sophisticated plane on the face of the earth that has just been stolen from Russia. You fly through different areas shooting enemy MIGS and other FireFox prototypes. You must avoid Russian infra-red radar tracking and find the refueling points to make it further into the game. High altitude flying would use less fuel but would make FireFox more vulnerable to detection. Flying at a low altitude would use more fuel but would give you better cover from the MIGS.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]This game uses a laser disc.[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]FireFox was released in January 1984. 1615 deluxe units were produced.[CR]In February 1984, standard models were released. 500 units were produced.[CR]FireFox is based on the Warner Brothers 1982 movie of the same name and used a few scenes from it. The game casts the player in the roll of Clint Eastwood's character, Major Gant, whose mission is to steal a top secret Russian war plane, and pilot it out of the U.S.S.R. to America.[CR]ATEI 1984, Atari presented a huge simulation model of the FireFox's cockpit with the video display on a screen situated some 8 feet from the cockpit's nose. Unfortunately, this simulation model was never been available in the arcades.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Project Leader : Mike Hally[CR]Game Design/Storyboards : Dave Ralston[CR]Program : Greg Rivera, Norm Avellar[CR]Voice Digitalization : Earl Vickers[CR]Score Composer/Conductor : Jeff Gusman[CR]Hardware Design : Peter Franusic[CR]Technician : Mihn Nguyen[CR]System Design : Jed Margolin[CR]Control Panel Design : Mike Jang[CR]Senior Video Editor : Moe Shore[CR]Video Edit/Sound/Lab Design : Bill Crooks[CR]Video Technical/Lab Design : Chris Crummett[CR]</plot>

It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on Apr. 24th, 2009.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* All Songs Mode : At the title screen, press the leftmost white key on the player 2 side exactly 9 times. Then press the middle white key 9 times. Finally, press the last white key 8 times. The screen should flash white. Now when you press the Effector button, 'All Music Mode' should be among the list of options. Use your side's turntable to turn on All Music Mode. You will now be able to select every song in the game on any stage.[CR]* Get High Speed, Mirror, Random, etc. : When you are in the screen where you pick your songs, highlight the song you are going to play, then press the effector button 7 times. You should see something on the left side of the screen after you push it 7 times. Now hold the effector button down. The thing on the left should now stay visible. Hold the effector button down while pushing these buttons for modes : [CR]Mirror - push left blue button once [CR]Random - push left blue button twice [CR]High Speed 1 - push right blue button once [CR]High Speed 2 - push right blue button twice [CR]High Speed 3 - push right blue button 3 times [CR]Hidden - push middle white button once [CR]Sudden - push middle white button twice [CR]Stealth - push middle white button 3 times [CR]Remember to hold the effector button down when pushing any of the buttons for the modes. To reset or 'turn off' any of the modes just hold the effector down at the song select screen and press the key until the thing on the left has all lines.[CR]* Re-arranging songlist by Anothers : This only works for Hard mode, since Basic mode does not have Anothers. While selecting game type mode (Basic/Hard/Expert), hold the Effector key down and hit any key. This will then rearrange the songlist according to Another difficulties. If a song does not have an Another, it will be arranged to it's normal difficulty. [CR]Note : You can still select the normal version of the song by hitting the two black keys on the highlighted song.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. beatmania (1997)[CR]2. beatmania 2nd MIX (1998)[CR]3. beatmania 3rd MIX (1998)[CR]4. hiphopmania Complete MIX (1999)[CR]5. beatmania 4th MIX - The Beat Goes On (1999)[CR]6. beatmania 5th MIX - Time To Get Down (1999)[CR]7. hiphopmania Complete MIX 2 (2000)[CR]8. beatmania Club MIX (2000)[CR]9. beatmania CORE REMIX (2000)[CR]10. beatmania Featuring Dreams Come True (2000)[CR]11. beatmania 6th MIX - The UK Underground Music (2001)[CR]12. beatmania 7th - Keepin' Evolution (2002)[CR]13. beatmania The Final (2002)[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Producer : Koji Okamoto[CR]Director : Seiji Higurashi[CR]Sound directors : Takehiko Fujii, Kiyotaka Sugimoto[CR]Sound superviser : Reo Nagumo[CR]Programmers : Yohei Marufuji, Masaru Nakamura[CR]Cg designers : Yaku Hiranabe, Mikio Yasumatsu, Tomoko Shiono[CR]Hardware engineer : Masayuki Senami[CR]Mechanical enginners : Yuichiro Sagawa, Toshiharu Miura[CR]Graphic designer : Noriyuki Yokoki[CR]Composers : D&amp;G Music Factory (AMD), Deep Emotion, Dj Oddball, Hiroshi Watarai, Hiroyuki Togo (KCEJ), Kouichi Yamazaki, Kiyotaka Sugimoto, Mikio Endo, Mitsukumi Murayama, NM Sequence Unlimited (AMD), Reo Nagumo, Takayuki Ishikawa, Takehiko Fujii, Hiroshi Takeyasu, Toshiyuki Kakuta (KCEJ), Larry Dunn, Luisa Dunn, Hiroshi Watanabe, Aki, Tag, Delaware, Nouvo Nude[CR]Sound data analyzers : Mitsukuni Murayama, Ryuchi Nitta, Migitera Osamu, Uchida Tomoyuki, Tatsuya Furukawa (good~cool), Tag, Aki[CR]Vocalist &amp; Rappers : Megumi Oka, Scotty D., Andrea Robinson, Brenda Vaughn, Argie Lanette Phine, Linda Gish, Ike Nelson, Jeff Coote[CR]Drummer : Kiyotaka Sugimoto[CR]Dancers : Nami, Wan~chan[CR]Mixing engineers : Masaki akamura (Onkio Haus), Toshihiro Hayano (Kim Studio)[CR]Japanese~English translator : Justin Lazaroff[CR]</plot>

Expert mode turns off the 'catch-up' code, so there is no computer help for the players that are behind. This is for players who want a fair-and-square head-to-head race without any computer assistance. Also in expert mode, the green guide boxes for the boost zones are disabled, and the 'help boxes', that pop are disabled.[CR]* Mirror Mode and Expert Mode can both be active at the same time. Just hold down View1 and View2 at the same time during the track select screen.[CR]* No Drones Mode : Press View1 during the ship select screen. This mode is included for the really good players who want the race solely the result of head-to-head racing, without the chance of the race being influenced by one person getting bumped by a drone, or by the drones clustering around one person and not the other.[CR]* Cruise Control : If the player doesn't step on the gas pedal at the start of the game, then the game will automatically keep the gas pedal at 80% of max speed.[CR]* Barrel Rolls : Double-tapping the yellow buttons makes the ship roll to the right and left.

				<title_clean>Killer Instinct</title_clean>
				<plot>Killer Instinct (c) 1994 Midway Mfg. Co.[CR]10 genetically engineered fighters engage in 1-on-1 combat in a tournament arranged by the sinister 'Ultratech', the organization behind the genetic creation of the fighters. The tournament soon turns into a battle for survival.[CR]Each player starts the game with 2 energy bars, which represent the amount of health each player has for the entire game. Once the first bar is depleted, the player falls, gets up and starts to use the second energy bar. A voice will subsequently announce either 'Round Two' or 'Killer Instinct!'. The player who wins the first round gets to keep their remaining energy, and still has the second bar to use in future fights. This gives an advantage to the player who wins the first round.[CR]Killer Instinct introduced incredibly complex combos to the fighting genre, as well as including the Fatalities and Humiliations made famous by Midway's "Mortal Kombat" Series.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : R4600 (@ 100 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : ADSP2105 (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : DMA-driven (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Screen Orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video Resolution : 320 x 240 Pixels[CR]Screen Refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette Colors : 32768[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 6[CR]=&gt; [1] QP, [2] MP, [3] FP[CR]=&gt; [4] QK, [5] MK, [6] FK[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Killer Instinct was released in October 1994. Manufactured &amp; sold by Midway, under license from Nintendo. Developed by Rare.[CR]This is the first arcade game to use a hard disk drive for mass storage. Killer Instinct's superbly-rendered graphics were considered to be among the finest of their day. The entire game was pre-rendered using SGI computers (Silicon Graphics Incorporated). In addition to this, the backgrounds themselves were pre-rendered as a 'movie', which simply adjusted frames based on your current location. Killer Instinct was the first game to feature 'auto-combos'.[CR]Jago is considered as Killer Instinct's version of Street Fighter's Ryu.[CR]The Glacius character design is rumoured to be influenced by the T-1000 from the Hollywood film 'Terminator 2'.[CR]The character Sabrewulf appears as an enemy in the game 'Sabre Wulf', released by Rare (known at the time as "Ultimate Play the Game) on a variety of home computers during the 1980s, and later resurrected for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance.[CR]"Cruis'n USA" and Killer Instinct were both released as public previews for the then upcoming 'Nintendo Ultra 64' console (later renamed the 'Nintendo 64'). Killer Instinct was the first game to be ported to a home console; NOT to the Nintendo 64, as intended, but to the Nintendo Super NES. This was due to the Nintendo 64's development falling severely behind schedule. Only "Cruis'n USA" would actually appear on the Nintendo 64.[CR]The Nintendo 64's hardware is totally different - and vastly inferior to - the arcade hardware that drove 'Cruis'n USA' and 'Killer Instinct' (which, incidentally, were also different from each OTHER). In the end, neither game actually represented what the Nintendo 64 console was actually capable of and the home conversions were generally considered to be a severe disappointment.[CR]Brad Russell holds the official record for this game with 477,250 points.[CR]Nintendo/Rare released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Killer Cuts - 1948-1-1 HMG) on 1995. Besides being sold separately, the soundtrack was bundled with the initial release of the Nintendo Super Famicom version of the game in limited quantity.[CR]A Killer instinct unit appears in the 2002 movie 'Comic Book Villains'.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]PROTOTYPE 1 :[CR]* Software version : 4.7[CR]REVISION 1 :[CR]* Software version : 1.3[CR]REVISION 2 :[CR]* Software version : 1.4[CR]REVISION 3 :[CR]* Software version : 1.5d[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Basic Controls :[CR]Each player's fighter is controlled using six buttons and one joystick. Anyone familiar with Capcom's 'Street Fighter' series will find KI's button layout familiar. The top row of buttons are for high attacks/punches and the bottom row are for low ones. [CR]The buttons are :[CR]1 = Quick Punch 2 = Middle Punch 3 = Fierce Punch[CR]4 = Quick Kick 5 = Middle Kick 6 = Fierce Kick[CR]Pull the joystick away from your opponent to block.[CR]* Play as Eyedol (on the 1.5d chip) : Select CINDER and when the VS animation starts, hold Right on the joystick and press 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6. If you do it right, the game will say 'Eyedol'.[CR]* Stage Select / Music Select : After choosing the character you want with the Start button, immediately press and hold Up or Down along with one of the Punch or Kick buttons. Different combinations allow different boards. The first player to choose their character gets to choose the stage. The second player gets to choose the music with the same method. The selectable levels are as follows;[CR]Mountain Temple : (Up+LP)[CR]Dungeon : (Up+MP)[CR]Mountain Shrine : (Up+HP)[CR]Castle Rofftop : (Up+LK)[CR]City Rooftop in Chicago : (Up+MK)[CR]Desert Rooftop : (Up+HK)[CR]Canyon : (Down+LP)[CR]Altar : (Down+MP)[CR]Warehouse Basement : (Down+HP)[CR]Chicago Alleyway : (Down+LK)[CR]Castle : (Down+MK)[CR]Industrial Warehouse : (Down+HK)[CR]Desert Rooftop : (Down+Start)[CR]Sky top : Player 1 (Down MK), Player 2 (Down+MK)[CR]Boxing Gym : ???[CR]Eydol's Lair : ???[CR]Tiger Shrine : ???[CR]* Last Breath : This allows players one last chance for life, and allows them to gain enough energy to take one more hit. After the voice says 'No Mercy', the player can start rotating the joy stick and mashing the buttons. Their combatant will then get back up and start to fight again. This MUST do this before the opponent starts doing the 'No Mercy' move. [CR]* Power Up : The Power up bar is the white flashing vertical bar that is situated in the player's health bar. This allows the fighters to unleash more devastating moves, such as the Shadow moves and Triple projectiles. The bar is usually powered up by doing a combo breaker. 'Sabrewulf' can get it by doing his Energy Howl, and Spinal can get it by obtaining skulls. If the bar is NOT flashing, then the player's gither is not powered up.[CR]* Turbo Mode : During the 'Vs Animation', if both players hold the joystick to the RIGHT, and hold buttons 1+2+3. A 'swish' sound will play indicating that the TURBO mode is now active. It's also possible to activate the TURBO mode in the single player game, but the player must still do the stated actions on the second player controls.[CR]* Combo Breaker : During the 'Vs Animation' (after character selection and just prior to the bout starting), if both players push DOWN and START, the announcer says 'Combo Breaker'. Combo Breakers are now much easier to achieve.[CR]* High Scores Table : During the demo mode, press UP on both joysticks to view the high scores.[CR]* Random Character Select : At the 'Character Select' screen, press UP while pressing START and the game will select a character at random.[CR]* Different Coloured Outfits : Once you have chosen your chosen character (and have not pressed a button) moving the joystick UP and DOWN will allow you to change the colours of your player's outfit.[CR]* Humiliation (Only available if you haven't lost any energy bars during the battle) :[CR]T.J COMBO : (Stand anywhere) Down(x3), LP.[CR]JAGO : (Stand anywhere) Forward, Downforward, Down, Downback, Back, MK.[CR]GLACIUS : (Stand anywhere) Forward(x2), Back, LK.[CR]SPINAL : (Stand anywhere) Back, DownBack, Down, Downforward, Forward, HK.[CR]ORCHID : (Stand anywhere) Forward, DownForward, Down, Downback, Back, HP.[CR]CHIEF THUNDER : (Stand anywhere) Down(x3), Forward, LK.[CR]FULGORE : (Stand anywhere) Back, DownBack, Down, Downforward, Forward, MK.[CR]CINDER : (Stand anywhere) Back(x3), HK.[CR]SABREWULF : (Stand anywhere) Forward(x3), LP.[CR]RIPTOR : (Stand anywhere) Down(x2), Forward(x2), HP.[CR]* No Mercy - T.J COMBO :[CR]1. (Stand close to opponent) Back(x2), Forward(x2), MP - A bell rings, he jabs his opponent in the gut and then turns his back to the viewer, and breaks the opponent's neck.[CR]2. (Stand close to opponent) Back, BackDown, Down, DownForward, Forward, HK - He punches his opponent and then spin punches them into the glass of the screen.[CR]* No Mercy - JAGO :[CR]1.

				<plot>Killer Instinct (c) 1994 Midway Mfg. Co.[CR]10 genetically engineered fighters engage in 1-on-1 combat in a tournament arranged by the sinister 'Ultratech', the organization behind the genetic creation of the fighters. The tournament soon turns into a battle for survival.[CR]Each player starts the game with 2 energy bars, which represent the amount of health each player has for the entire game. Once the first bar is depleted, the player falls, gets up and starts to use the second energy bar. A voice will subsequently announce either 'Round Two' or 'Killer Instinct!'. The player who wins the first round gets to keep their remaining energy, and still has the second bar to use in future fights. This gives an advantage to the player who wins the first round.[CR]Killer Instinct introduced incredibly complex combos to the fighting genre, as well as including the Fatalities and Humiliations made famous by Midway's "Mortal Kombat" Series.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : R4600 (@ 100 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : ADSP2105 (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : DMA-driven (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Screen Orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video Resolution : 320 x 240 Pixels[CR]Screen Refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette Colors : 32768[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 6[CR]=&gt; [1] QP, [2] MP, [3] FP[CR]=&gt; [4] QK, [5] MK, [6] FK[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Killer Instinct was released in October 1994. Manufactured &amp; sold by Midway, under license from Nintendo. Developed by Rare.[CR]This is the first arcade game to use a hard disk drive for mass storage. Killer Instinct's superbly-rendered graphics were considered to be among the finest of their day. The entire game was pre-rendered using SGI computers (Silicon Graphics Incorporated). In addition to this, the backgrounds themselves were pre-rendered as a 'movie', which simply adjusted frames based on your current location. Killer Instinct was the first game to feature 'auto-combos'.[CR]Jago is considered as Killer Instinct's version of Street Fighter's Ryu.[CR]The Glacius character design is rumoured to be influenced by the T-1000 from the Hollywood film 'Terminator 2'.[CR]The character Sabrewulf appears as an enemy in the game 'Sabre Wulf', released by Rare (known at the time as "Ultimate Play the Game) on a variety of home computers during the 1980s, and later resurrected for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance.[CR]"Cruis'n USA" and Killer Instinct were both released as public previews for the then upcoming 'Nintendo Ultra 64' console (later renamed the 'Nintendo 64'). Killer Instinct was the first game to be ported to a home console; NOT to the Nintendo 64, as intended, but to the Nintendo Super NES. This was due to the Nintendo 64's development falling severely behind schedule. Only "Cruis'n USA" would actually appear on the Nintendo 64.[CR]The Nintendo 64's hardware is totally different - and vastly inferior to - the arcade hardware that drove 'Cruis'n USA' and 'Killer Instinct' (which, incidentally, were also different from each OTHER). In the end, neither game actually represented what the Nintendo 64 console was actually capable of and the home conversions were generally considered to be a severe disappointment.[CR]Brad Russell holds the official record for this game with 477,250 points.[CR]Nintendo/Rare released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Killer Cuts - 1948-1-1 HMG) on 1995. Besides being sold separately, the soundtrack was bundled with the initial release of the Nintendo Super Famicom version of the game in limited quantity.[CR]A Killer instinct unit appears in the 2002 movie 'Comic Book Villains'.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]PROTOTYPE 1 :[CR]* Software version : 4.7[CR]REVISION 1 :[CR]* Software version : 1.3[CR]REVISION 2 :[CR]* Software version : 1.4[CR]REVISION 3 :[CR]* Software version : 1.5d[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Basic Controls :[CR]Each player's fighter is controlled using six buttons and one joystick. Anyone familiar with Capcom's 'Street Fighter' series will find KI's button layout familiar. The top row of buttons are for high attacks/punches and the bottom row are for low ones. [CR]The buttons are :[CR]1 = Quick Punch 2 = Middle Punch 3 = Fierce Punch[CR]4 = Quick Kick 5 = Middle Kick 6 = Fierce Kick[CR]Pull the joystick away from your opponent to block.[CR]* Play as Eyedol (on the 1.5d chip) : Select CINDER and when the VS animation starts, hold Right on the joystick and press 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6. If you do it right, the game will say 'Eyedol'.[CR]* Stage Select / Music Select : After choosing the character you want with the Start button, immediately press and hold Up or Down along with one of the Punch or Kick buttons. Different combinations allow different boards. The first player to choose their character gets to choose the stage. The second player gets to choose the music with the same method. The selectable levels are as follows;[CR]Mountain Temple : (Up+LP)[CR]Dungeon : (Up+MP)[CR]Mountain Shrine : (Up+HP)[CR]Castle Rofftop : (Up+LK)[CR]City Rooftop in Chicago : (Up+MK)[CR]Desert Rooftop : (Up+HK)[CR]Canyon : (Down+LP)[CR]Altar : (Down+MP)[CR]Warehouse Basement : (Down+HP)[CR]Chicago Alleyway : (Down+LK)[CR]Castle : (Down+MK)[CR]Industrial Warehouse : (Down+HK)[CR]Desert Rooftop : (Down+Start)[CR]Sky top : Player 1 (Down MK), Player 2 (Down+MK)[CR]Boxing Gym : ???[CR]Eydol's Lair : ???[CR]Tiger Shrine : ???[CR]* Last Breath : This allows players one last chance for life, and allows them to gain enough energy to take one more hit. After the voice says 'No Mercy', the player can start rotating the joy stick and mashing the buttons. Their combatant will then get back up and start to fight again. This MUST do this before the opponent starts doing the 'No Mercy' move. [CR]* Power Up : The Power up bar is the white flashing vertical bar that is situated in the player's health bar. This allows the fighters to unleash more devastating moves, such as the Shadow moves and Triple projectiles. The bar is usually powered up by doing a combo breaker. 'Sabrewulf' can get it by doing his Energy Howl, and Spinal can get it by obtaining skulls. If the bar is NOT flashing, then the player's gither is not powered up.[CR]* Turbo Mode : During the 'Vs Animation', if both players hold the joystick to the RIGHT, and hold buttons 1+2+3. A 'swish' sound will play indicating that the TURBO mode is now active. It's also possible to activate the TURBO mode in the single player game, but the player must still do the stated actions on the second player controls.[CR]* Combo Breaker : During the 'Vs Animation' (after character selection and just prior to the bout starting), if both players push DOWN and START, the announcer says 'Combo Breaker'. Combo Breakers are now much easier to achieve.[CR]* High Scores Table : During the demo mode, press UP on both joysticks to view the high scores.[CR]* Random Character Select : At the 'Character Select' screen, press UP while pressing START and the game will select a character at random.[CR]* Different Coloured Outfits : Once you have chosen your chosen character (and have not pressed a button) moving the joystick UP and DOWN will allow you to change the colours of your player's outfit.[CR]* Humiliation (Only available if you haven't lost any energy bars during the battle) :[CR]T.J COMBO : (Stand anywhere) Down(x3), LP.[CR]JAGO : (Stand anywhere) Forward, Downforward, Down, Downback, Back, MK.[CR]GLACIUS : (Stand anywhere) Forward(x2), Back, LK.[CR]SPINAL : (Stand anywhere) Back, DownBack, Down, Downforward, Forward, HK.[CR]ORCHID : (Stand anywhere) Forward, DownForward, Down, Downback, Back, HP.[CR]CHIEF THUNDER : (Stand anywhere) Down(x3), Forward, LK.[CR]FULGORE : (Stand anywhere) Back, DownBack, Down, Downforward, Forward, MK.[CR]CINDER : (Stand anywhere) Back(x3), HK.[CR]SABREWULF : (Stand anywhere) Forward(x3), LP.[CR]RIPTOR : (Stand anywhere) Down(x2), Forward(x2), HP.[CR]* No Mercy - T.J COMBO :[CR]1. (Stand close to opponent) Back(x2), Forward(x2), MP - A bell rings, he jabs his opponent in the gut and then turns his back to the viewer, and breaks the opponent's neck.[CR]2.

The selectable levels are as follows;[CR]Mountain Temple : (Up+LP)[CR]Dungeon : (Up+MP)[CR]Mountain Shrine : (Up+HP)[CR]Castle Rofftop : (Up+LK)[CR]City Rooftop in Chicago : (Up+MK)[CR]Desert Rooftop : (Up+HK)[CR]Canyon : (Down+LP)[CR]Altar : (Down+MP)[CR]Warehouse Basement : (Down+HP)[CR]Chicago Alleyway : (Down+LK)[CR]Castle : (Down+MK)[CR]Industrial Warehouse : (Down+HK)[CR]Desert Rooftop : (Down+Start)[CR]Sky top : Player 1 (Down MK), Player 2 (Down+MK)[CR]Boxing Gym : ???[CR]Eydol's Lair : ???[CR]Tiger Shrine : ???[CR]* Last Breath : This allows players one last chance for life, and allows them to gain enough energy to take one more hit. After the voice says 'No Mercy', the player can start rotating the joy stick and mashing the buttons. Their combatant will then get back up and start to fight again. This MUST do this before the opponent starts doing the 'No Mercy' move. [CR]* Power Up : The Power up bar is the white flashing vertical bar that is situated in the player's health bar. This allows the fighters to unleash more devastating moves, such as the Shadow moves and Triple projectiles. The bar is usually powered up by doing a combo breaker. 'Sabrewulf' can get it by doing his Energy Howl, and Spinal can get it by obtaining skulls. If the bar is NOT flashing, then the player's gither is not powered up.[CR]* Turbo Mode : During the 'Vs Animation', if both players hold the joystick to the RIGHT, and hold buttons 1+2+3. A 'swish' sound will play indicating that the TURBO mode is now active. It's also possible to activate the TURBO mode in the single player game, but the player must still do the stated actions on the second player controls.[CR]* Combo Breaker : During the 'Vs Animation' (after character selection and just prior to the bout starting), if both players push DOWN and START, the announcer says 'Combo Breaker'. Combo Breakers are now much easier to achieve.[CR]* High Scores Table : During the demo mode, press UP on both joysticks to view the high scores.[CR]* Random Character Select : At the 'Character Select' screen, press UP while pressing START and the game will select a character at random.[CR]* Different Coloured Outfits : Once you have chosen your chosen character (and have not pressed a button) moving the joystick UP and DOWN will allow you to change the colours of your player's outfit.[CR]* Humiliation (Only available if you haven't lost any energy bars during the battle) :[CR]T.J COMBO : (Stand anywhere) Down(x3), LP.[CR]JAGO : (Stand anywhere) Forward, Downforward, Down, Downback, Back, MK.[CR]GLACIUS : (Stand anywhere) Forward(x2), Back, LK.[CR]SPINAL : (Stand anywhere) Back, DownBack, Down, Downforward, Forward, HK.[CR]ORCHID : (Stand anywhere) Forward, DownForward, Down, Downback, Back, HP.[CR]CHIEF THUNDER : (Stand anywhere) Down(x3), Forward, LK.[CR]FULGORE : (Stand anywhere) Back, DownBack, Down, Downforward, Forward, MK.[CR]CINDER : (Stand anywhere) Back(x3), HK.[CR]SABREWULF : (Stand anywhere) Forward(x3), LP.[CR]RIPTOR : (Stand anywhere) Down(x2), Forward(x2), HP.[CR]* No Mercy - T.J COMBO :[CR]1.

				<plot>Killer Instinct 2 (c) 1996 Midway Mfg. Co.[CR]A great sequel of the previous game include new features and new characters. [CR]The plot follows on where the first installment left off. Eyedol's death at the hands of Orchid accidentally sets off a time warp, transporting some of the combatants back in time and allowing the Demon Lord Gargos to escape from Limbo.[CR]Now, trapped 2000 years in the past, the warriors that survived Killer Instinct, along with several new faces, fight for the right to face Gargos in combat. Each character that survived the journey from the first game has a corresponding background story, while new characters on this installment are native inhabitants of this past time period. Some fighters, like T.J. Combo who survives from the original, just want to get home. Others, like new character Tusk, want to bring an end to Gargos and his reign of evil. This time there is no tournament or prize money, just a fight to the finish with the fate of the future hanging in the balance.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : R4600 (@ 100 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : ADSP2105 (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : DMA-driven (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Screen Orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video Resolution : 320 x 240 Pixels[CR]Screen Refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette Colors : 32768[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 6[CR]=&gt; [1] QP, [2] MP, [3] FP[CR]=&gt; [4] QK, [5] MK, [6] FK[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Killer Instinct 2 was released in January 1996.

This time there is no tournament or prize money, just a fight to the finish with the fate of the future hanging in the balance.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : R4600 (@ 100 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : ADSP2105 (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : DMA-driven (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Screen Orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video Resolution : 320 x 240 Pixels[CR]Screen Refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette Colors : 32768[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 6[CR]=&gt; [1] QP, [2] MP, [3] FP[CR]=&gt; [4] QK, [5] MK, [6] FK[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Killer Instinct 2 was released in January 1996.

				<plot>Killer Instinct 2 (c) 1996 Midway Mfg. Co.[CR]A great sequel of the previous game include new features and new characters. [CR]The plot follows on where the first installment left off. Eyedol's death at the hands of Orchid accidentally sets off a time warp, transporting some of the combatants back in time and allowing the Demon Lord Gargos to escape from Limbo.[CR]Now, trapped 2000 years in the past, the warriors that survived Killer Instinct, along with several new faces, fight for the right to face Gargos in combat. Each character that survived the journey from the first game has a corresponding background story, while new characters on this installment are native inhabitants of this past time period. Some fighters, like T.J. Combo who survives from the original, just want to get home. Others, like new character Tusk, want to bring an end to Gargos and his reign of evil.

				<plot>Killer Instinct 2 (c) 1996 Midway Mfg. Co.[CR]A great sequel of the previous game include new features and new characters. [CR]The plot follows on where the first installment left off. Eyedol's death at the hands of Orchid accidentally sets off a time warp, transporting some of the combatants back in time and allowing the Demon Lord Gargos to escape from Limbo.[CR]Now, trapped 2000 years in the past, the warriors that survived Killer Instinct, along with several new faces, fight for the right to face Gargos in combat. Each character that survived the journey from the first game has a corresponding background story, while new characters on this installment are native inhabitants of this past time period. Some fighters, like T.J. Combo who survives from the original, just want to get home. Others, like new character Tusk, want to bring an end to Gargos and his reign of evil. This time there is no tournament or prize money, just a fight to the finish with the fate of the future hanging in the balance.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : R4600 (@ 100 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : ADSP2105 (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : DMA-driven (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Screen Orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video Resolution : 320 x 240 Pixels[CR]Screen Refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette Colors : 32768[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 6[CR]=&gt; [1] QP, [2] MP, [3] FP[CR]=&gt; [4] QK, [5] MK, [6] FK[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Killer Instinct 2 was released in January 1996.

				<plot>Killer Instinct 2 (c) 1996 Midway Mfg. Co.[CR]A great sequel of the previous game include new features and new characters. [CR]The plot follows on where the first installment left off. Eyedol's death at the hands of Orchid accidentally sets off a time warp, transporting some of the combatants back in time and allowing the Demon Lord Gargos to escape from Limbo.[CR]Now, trapped 2000 years in the past, the warriors that survived Killer Instinct, along with several new faces, fight for the right to face Gargos in combat. Each character that survived the journey from the first game has a corresponding background story, while new characters on this installment are native inhabitants of this past time period. Some fighters, like T.J. Combo who survives from the original, just want to get home. Others, like new character Tusk, want to bring an end to Gargos and his reign of evil. This time there is no tournament or prize money, just a fight to the finish with the fate of the future hanging in the balance.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : R4600 (@ 100 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : ADSP2105 (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : DMA-driven (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Screen Orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video Resolution : 320 x 240 Pixels[CR]Screen Refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette Colors : 32768[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 6[CR]=&gt; [1] QP, [2] MP, [3] FP[CR]=&gt; [4] QK, [5] MK, [6] FK[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Killer Instinct 2 was released in January 1996. Manufactured &amp; sold by Midway under license from Nintendo. Developed by Rare.[CR]In addition to the already impressive amount of endings the game has, there are still a bunch of others that were never "tied into the game", according to programmer Chris Tilston. However, thanks to a text dump, they have been found. It is unknown what the conditions to unlock them were going to be. These are the unused endings:[CR]Fulgore:[CR]1) WITH ALL TASKS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE, FULGORE WANDERS FOREVER IN THE PAST, LOST AND DEVOID OF PURPOSE.[CR]2) FULGORES FAILURE TO ELIMINATE ORCHID IS A FATAL MISTAKE, WHICH HE DOES NOT LIVE TO REGRET.[CR]3) WITH FULGORES DEATH, ALL REMAINING TRACES OF ULTRATECH ARE ERASED.

THE FORCES OF GOOD HAVE WON AN IMPORTANT BATTLE.[CR]3) JAGO IS DEAD, BUT AT LEAST HE STOPPED ULTRATECH - OR DID HE... FULGORE HAS A NEW TARGET - JAGO'S ANCESTORS. IF JAGO WASN'T BORN, HE COULDN'T DESTROY ULTRATECH. FULGORE WILL WAIT...[CR]4) FULGORE SURVIVES AND REBUILDS ULTRATECH FROM ITS BURNING ASHES.

WITH FEW LEFT TO STAND IN HIS WAY, THE WORLD WILL SURELY FALL.[CR]Sabrewulf:[CR]1) BUT STUMBLING INTO THE ALIENS SHIP IS A FATAL MISTAKE.

				<plot>Killer Instinct (c) 1994 Midway Mfg. Co.[CR]10 genetically engineered fighters engage in 1-on-1 combat in a tournament arranged by the sinister 'Ultratech', the organization behind the genetic creation of the fighters. The tournament soon turns into a battle for survival.[CR]Each player starts the game with 2 energy bars, which represent the amount of health each player has for the entire game. Once the first bar is depleted, the player falls, gets up and starts to use the second energy bar. A voice will subsequently announce either 'Round Two' or 'Killer Instinct!'. The player who wins the first round gets to keep their remaining energy, and still has the second bar to use in future fights. This gives an advantage to the player who wins the first round.[CR]Killer Instinct introduced incredibly complex combos to the fighting genre, as well as including the Fatalities and Humiliations made famous by Midway's "Mortal Kombat" Series.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : R4600 (@ 100 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : ADSP2105 (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : DMA-driven (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Screen Orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video Resolution : 320 x 240 Pixels[CR]Screen Refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette Colors : 32768[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 6[CR]=&gt; [1] QP, [2] MP, [3] FP[CR]=&gt; [4] QK, [5] MK, [6] FK[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Killer Instinct was released in October 1994. Manufactured &amp; sold by Midway, under license from Nintendo. Developed by Rare.[CR]This is the first arcade game to use a hard disk drive for mass storage. Killer Instinct's superbly-rendered graphics were considered to be among the finest of their day. The entire game was pre-rendered using SGI computers (Silicon Graphics Incorporated). In addition to this, the backgrounds themselves were pre-rendered as a 'movie', which simply adjusted frames based on your current location. Killer Instinct was the first game to feature 'auto-combos'.[CR]Jago is considered as Killer Instinct's version of Street Fighter's Ryu.[CR]The Glacius character design is rumoured to be influenced by the T-1000 from the Hollywood film 'Terminator 2'.[CR]The character Sabrewulf appears as an enemy in the game 'Sabre Wulf', released by Rare (known at the time as "Ultimate Play the Game) on a variety of home computers during the 1980s, and later resurrected for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance.[CR]"Cruis'n USA" and Killer Instinct were both released as public previews for the then upcoming 'Nintendo Ultra 64' console (later renamed the 'Nintendo 64'). Killer Instinct was the first game to be ported to a home console; NOT to the Nintendo 64, as intended, but to the Nintendo Super NES. This was due to the Nintendo 64's development falling severely behind schedule. Only "Cruis'n USA" would actually appear on the Nintendo 64.[CR]The Nintendo 64's hardware is totally different - and vastly inferior to - the arcade hardware that drove 'Cruis'n USA' and 'Killer Instinct' (which, incidentally, were also different from each OTHER). In the end, neither game actually represented what the Nintendo 64 console was actually capable of and the home conversions were generally considered to be a severe disappointment.[CR]Brad Russell holds the official record for this game with 477,250 points.[CR]Nintendo/Rare released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Killer Cuts - 1948-1-1 HMG) on 1995. Besides being sold separately, the soundtrack was bundled with the initial release of the Nintendo Super Famicom version of the game in limited quantity.[CR]A Killer instinct unit appears in the 2002 movie 'Comic Book Villains'.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]PROTOTYPE 1 :[CR]* Software version : 4.7[CR]REVISION 1 :[CR]* Software version : 1.3[CR]REVISION 2 :[CR]* Software version : 1.4[CR]REVISION 3 :[CR]* Software version : 1.5d[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Basic Controls :[CR]Each player's fighter is controlled using six buttons and one joystick. Anyone familiar with Capcom's 'Street Fighter' series will find KI's button layout familiar. The top row of buttons are for high attacks/punches and the bottom row are for low ones. [CR]The buttons are :[CR]1 = Quick Punch 2 = Middle Punch 3 = Fierce Punch[CR]4 = Quick Kick 5 = Middle Kick 6 = Fierce Kick[CR]Pull the joystick away from your opponent to block.[CR]* Play as Eyedol (on the 1.5d chip) : Select CINDER and when the VS animation starts, hold Right on the joystick and press 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6. If you do it right, the game will say 'Eyedol'.[CR]* Stage Select / Music Select : After choosing the character you want with the Start button, immediately press and hold Up or Down along with one of the Punch or Kick buttons. Different combinations allow different boards. The first player to choose their character gets to choose the stage. The second player gets to choose the music with the same method. The selectable levels are as follows;[CR]Mountain Temple : (Up+LP)[CR]Dungeon : (Up+MP)[CR]Mountain Shrine : (Up+HP)[CR]Castle Rofftop : (Up+LK)[CR]City Rooftop in Chicago : (Up+MK)[CR]Desert Rooftop : (Up+HK)[CR]Canyon : (Down+LP)[CR]Altar : (Down+MP)[CR]Warehouse Basement : (Down+HP)[CR]Chicago Alleyway : (Down+LK)[CR]Castle : (Down+MK)[CR]Industrial Warehouse : (Down+HK)[CR]Desert Rooftop : (Down+Start)[CR]Sky top : Player 1 (Down MK), Player 2 (Down+MK)[CR]Boxing Gym : ???[CR]Eydol's Lair : ???[CR]Tiger Shrine : ???[CR]* Last Breath : This allows players one last chance for life, and allows them to gain enough energy to take one more hit. After the voice says 'No Mercy', the player can start rotating the joy stick and mashing the buttons. Their combatant will then get back up and start to fight again. This MUST do this before the opponent starts doing the 'No Mercy' move. [CR]* Power Up : The Power up bar is the white flashing vertical bar that is situated in the player's health bar. This allows the fighters to unleash more devastating moves, such as the Shadow moves and Triple projectiles. The bar is usually powered up by doing a combo breaker. 'Sabrewulf' can get it by doing his Energy Howl, and Spinal can get it by obtaining skulls. If the bar is NOT flashing, then the player's gither is not powered up.[CR]* Turbo Mode : During the 'Vs Animation', if both players hold the joystick to the RIGHT, and hold buttons 1+2+3. A 'swish' sound will play indicating that the TURBO mode is now active. It's also possible to activate the TURBO mode in the single player game, but the player must still do the stated actions on the second player controls.[CR]* Combo Breaker : During the 'Vs Animation' (after character selection and just prior to the bout starting), if both players push DOWN and START, the announcer says 'Combo Breaker'. Combo Breakers are now much easier to achieve.[CR]* High Scores Table : During the demo mode, press UP on both joysticks to view the high scores.[CR]* Random Character Select : At the 'Character Select' screen, press UP while pressing START and the game will select a character at random.[CR]* Different Coloured Outfits : Once you have chosen your chosen character (and have not pressed a button) moving the joystick UP and DOWN will allow you to change the colours of your player's outfit.[CR]* Humiliation (Only available if you haven't lost any energy bars during the battle) :[CR]T.J COMBO : (Stand anywhere) Down(x3), LP.[CR]JAGO : (Stand anywhere) Forward, Downforward, Down, Downback, Back, MK.[CR]GLACIUS : (Stand anywhere) Forward(x2), Back, LK.[CR]SPINAL : (Stand anywhere) Back, DownBack, Down, Downforward, Forward, HK.[CR]ORCHID : (Stand anywhere) Forward, DownForward, Down, Downback, Back, HP.[CR]CHIEF THUNDER : (Stand anywhere) Down(x3), Forward, LK.[CR]FULGORE : (Stand anywhere) Back, DownBack, Down, Downforward, Forward, MK.[CR]CINDER : (Stand anywhere) Back(x3), HK.[CR]SABREWULF : (Stand anywhere) Forward(x3), LP.[CR]RIPTOR : (Stand anywhere) Down(x2), Forward(x2), HP.[CR]* No Mercy - T.J COMBO :[CR]1.

				<title_clean>Street Fighter III: New Generation</title_clean>
				<plot>Street Fighter III - New Generation (c) 1997 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]A New Generation of Street Fighters! Features larger characters sprites than previous Street Fighter games with the smoothest, most detailed 2-D animation ever made at the time of its release, a level of quality that is yet to be matched by any other 2-D game outside of the Street Fighter III series as of 2004; some complain that too many things are animated and each animation contains too many frames, slowing down the pace of the game.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Capcom Play System III Hardware (CP-S III) [CR]Game ID : CP-S III No. 02 [CR]CD Number : CAP-SF3000 [CR]CD Label : CAP-SF3-3 [CR]Main CPU : Hitachi SH2 (possibly 2) [CR]Storage : SCSI CD Rom, RAM and Flash ROM. [CR]RAM : SIMMs on the left w/ 16M of data each (each has 8x 16M Flash ROMs, there's 4 SIMMs plugged in on this board). SIMMs on the right w/ 8M each (there's 4 Flash ROMs on each board and there are 2 SIMMs plugged in) [CR]OSC : 60MHz. 42.9545MHz, XTAL 3.6864MHz.[CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick [CR]Buttons : 6 [CR]= &gt; [1] LP (Jab), [2] MP (Strong), [3] HP (Fierce) [CR]= &gt; [4] LK (Short), [5] MK (Forward), [6] HK (Roundhouse)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Street Fighter III was released in February 1997.[CR]According to Capcom's flyer for this game, this game has character animations that are animated at 64 frames per second at the maximum.[CR]The marquee simply refers to this game as 'Three'.[CR]Sean was originally supposed to be the only fighter who used the Ryu and Ken's style in the game, Ken and Ryu were added in later by the demand of SF fans.[CR]The enigmatic hoax character Shen Long was revived in Street Fighter III after an issue of EGM that gave an incomplete strategy describing how to face him, and some doctored screen-shots that show Shen Long as an altered Ken or Ryu character model firing multiple hadou waves.[CR]Hugo, first introduced in "Street Fighter III - 2nd Impact", is present in the game code. Hugo is missing most of his animation frames and moves. His stage background from 2nd Impact is mostly intact, except that the background music being played is from Judgement Day - Gill's stage. Capcom presumably didn't have enough time to finish the Hugo character and decided to keep him for the sequel.[CR]The music from Alex's Stage (Jazzy NYC) contains the famous "Woo! Yeah!" voice sample from James Brown's "Think (About It)"; a sample that became a very popular and important component of Hip-Hop music, specially after the huge success of MC Rob Base &amp; DJ E-Z Rock's "It Takes Two" in the late 80's.[CR]QUOTE LIST :[CR]* Alex :[CR]Talk's cheap. Bluffing will get you nowhere against me.[CR]You're tough, but you can't outlast the best.[CR]You arrogant imbecile, you slacked off right at the end.[CR]You thought you had a chance?  C'mon, everyone knows you're no good.[CR]Just stay down.  Don't try to stand up.  You look pale![CR]I don't know where you trained yourself, but you didn't train hard enough. Those moves suck![CR]Damn!  I can't believe how poorly I fought.  Next time I will really beat the crap out of you![CR]I didn't think I'd have such a hard time with you![CR]I give my all no matter who I fight.[CR]Damn!  Even my sparring partner lasts longer than that![CR]You hit the ground right when I was about to go berserk. Lucky![CR]You say you were out of form? Your excuses are out of control![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : You may have mighty body blows, but you can't hit my vital organs.[CR]to Elena : If you want a man to like you, use those legs for something else.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : You're a pathetic excuse for a ninja.[CR]to Ken : You may be fast, but not fast enough to elude my fists.[CR]to Necro : Your moves are almost as freakin' weird as you are.[CR]to Oro : Control your temper old man.  I will ignore your piddly ass next time.[CR]to Ryu : You... you seem to live for the fight.[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]to Yang : You brothers sure are hot blooded! But you're both still lamers.[CR]* Dudley :[CR]You're down already? The spectators have asked for their shillings back![CR]Shall I awaken you with the waters of the Thames River?[CR]Good show, but it's just not in your blood.[CR]No matter how many times we fight, I'll always pound your limey hide.[CR]To err is human, but to win is noble.[CR]This was my finest hour![CR]'Cowards die often', or so it is said.[CR]The British spirit is an indomitable spirit![CR]I put on the kettle, but you can't even last till tea time.[CR]Another uncouth lout falls between my fists and the pavement.[CR]It seems the grace of victory doesn't love you.[CR]How could you have given me such a tussle?  'Tis not my day!  Time to go home![CR]to Alex : Ah, I just can't stand ill-mannered goons who ignore their grooming![CR]to Dudley : You dared to piss me off.  Was it boldness, or stupidity?[CR]to Elena : Pardon me for my violent behavior... Lady...[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : Not a bad go of things... I enjoyed it, Samurai lass![CR]to Ken : My apologies, but I have no chance but to maul sissy men like you![CR]to Necro :  At first glance you looked like a right good challenge. Appearances can decieve, eh?[CR]to Oro : By my honor, old man.  I swear I did not pull any punches![CR]to Ryu : Sad...The land of the Samurai must have fallen with you.[CR]to Sean : Such a greenhorn!  You left your temple wide open!  Bad form![CR]to Urien :[CR]to Yang : When it comes to lightning action, the speed of boxing is unsurpassed.[CR]to Yun : Your fighting skills are equal to...child's play.[CR]* Elena :[CR]I think we can be friends. You think so too, right?[CR]Are you tone-deaf? I had trouble timing myself to your moves.[CR]I'll never forget about today's fight![CR]African earth is my teacher. You must learn to respect it![CR]Will you fight me again someday?  I think it's wonderful![CR]What did you think of my finishing move?[CR]Did you let me win?  No one can be THAT bad.[CR]It was a great fight!  I wanted it to last forever![CR]I felt your rhythm![CR]You don't have any rhythm![CR]Maybe you should take up some other hobby.  You could try mountain biking.[CR]I was pleased to have fought with you.[CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley: ?[CR]to Elena : I hate copycats![CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Gill :[CR]If you tried harder, maybe you wouldn't fall so quickly. Pathetic![CR]Ignorant of your own incompetence. What a fool![CR]I should have been conquering worlds, not wasting time with the likes of you![CR]I held back, and still you cower on the ground like a peon. What a waste of human life![CR]Look into my eyes. I'll carve the mark of defeat on your brow.[CR]You actually made me pay attention to this fight for a moment.[CR]Not bad, but still you fall short of the perfection I embody.[CR]You call yourself well-trained?  Obviously humans follow the wrong leaders.. Anyone but me![CR]You did well, for one of the sheep.  Challenge me again when you learn from your mistakes.[CR]Are you paralyzed yet?  You're way below my expectations, but that's nothing new.[CR]I admire your courage, but you'd be a fool to challenge me again.[CR]* Ibuki :[CR]Don't underestimate me![CR]There's no second chance in the real fight![CR]Devote yourself to your training.[CR]I'll beat you from behind next time![CR]Even though I won, it was too close a fight.[CR]You don't have enough tenacity for the fight.[CR]Useless try.  You were beaten from the beginning.[CR]Now that you know the special move of the Shinobi, I cannot let you live.[CR]I don't think you can understand what Shinobi moves are all about.[CR]Hesitation in a fraction of a second can kill you.[CR]I'm the best there is![CR]It was my destiny to win.[CR]to Alex : So much for you, Macho Stud!  You sure lost that Power Instinct![CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : You'll get into a lot of trouble if you fight in a half-hearted way.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : Your cute charms won't save you from defeat![CR]to Necro : You use strange moves.  Are you a Shinobi too?[CR]to Oro : May you live long, old man![CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : You're fast, but I'm faster.[CR]* Ken :[CR]What a reckless man you are!  Don' try to execute a jump-kick against me![CR]Now you've learned how to kick your opponent![CR]It's the fighting sense that matters. Time off will never dull my instincts![CR]It was already decided that I would win![CR]I thought you had at least a little potential!  It seems I was wrong![CR]That was too easy![CR]It's not that you were good!  It's that I wasn't trying very hard![CR]I must be getting old to allow someone of your weak ability to almost win![CR]You were good! I almost broke a sweat.[CR]I had an extremely good sense of how the fight would go![CR]You hurt me, but I hurt you worse![CR]Don't be so depressed. You will get better with time.[CR]to Alex: You're not bad! But you're not so good either.  Just average...[CR]to Dudley : Hey old man! Don't even think about fighting me again![CR]to Elena : A lady like you shouldn't act so violently![CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : Did I do something that makes you hate me?[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : You're so interesting...[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : I think we've fought too many times now. When will you accept that I'm better?[CR]to Sean : You have to learn the basic rules of fighting![CR]to Urien: ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : I like a naughty boy like you![CR]* Necro :[CR]My rage was like a white inferno of anger. You will burn.[CR]Screw you bastard! I'm in pain! You'll wish you were never born![CR]Damn, I can't believe I'm breathing hard after fighting your sorry ass![CR]I'll win by any means necessary. I will survive![CR]What are you looking at?  What's your damn problem?[CR]Get outta my way or I'll tear you limb from limb.[CR]Apologize while you can idiot! Say you're sorry and I might forgive you for your crimes.[CR]Don't give me that punk ass attitude. You think I cheated![CR]I can't believe you're already out!  What am I supposed to do with all my rage now?[CR]So boring... I could spare change while kicking your ass without breaking a sweat.[CR]I warned you.  You didn't listen.  The masses of humanity will always suffer... at my hands![CR]No mercy to weekend warriors and pansy freaks![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : Thank you for being my punching bag. You're a true gentleman![CR]to Elena : ?[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : For some reason, I just don't like you blondie![CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : I'm through playing kids games with you. Go home![CR]* Oro :[CR]I used the minimum energy to insure victory.[CR]You were almost worthy of the lies you told about your ability.[CR]You have the power, you just don't know how to use it.[CR]You have to start by learning how to communicate with heaven and earth.[CR]It was over before I knew it. Too bad you weren't one of my students.[CR]You strain yourself too much. Fight without restraint and you will stand a chance.[CR]Show some respect to your elders, whippersnapper![CR]Some call it unearthly abilities. I call it Senjitsu.[CR]I have no time to deal with cretins like you.[CR]I was truly pressed. First time in 10 years I've broken a sweat.[CR]Such a lack of challenge. I thought you had burning passion, but you are devoid of talent.[CR]to Alex : Don't judge your opponents by their appearance. You're just a cocky youth.[CR]to Dudley : Your uppercut you're so proud of moves in slow motion to my eyes.[CR]to Elena : I see potential in you girl. Come on, come closer.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki: You're vicious. Too vicious. You can't touch me.[CR]to Ken : Your fighting spirit is strong. If I could train you like a dog, you might become good some day.[CR]to Necro: Your screwed up face is only entertainment.[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : You remind me of my younger days. I must train you if you are to realize your potential.[CR]to Sean : You're so young! I envy your youth, but not your lack of skill.[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Ryu :[CR]It was a good fight. Challenge me again![CR]These two fists are everything to me![CR]I was not concentrating!  I have not trained hard enough![CR]Get up! Show me your true power![CR]You're wounded.

				<plot>Street Fighter III - New Generation (c) 1997 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]A New Generation of Street Fighters! Features larger characters sprites than previous Street Fighter games with the smoothest, most detailed 2-D animation ever made at the time of its release, a level of quality that is yet to be matched by any other 2-D game outside of the Street Fighter III series as of 2004; some complain that too many things are animated and each animation contains too many frames, slowing down the pace of the game.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Capcom Play System III Hardware (CP-S III) [CR]Game ID : CP-S III No. 02 [CR]CD Number : CAP-SF3000 [CR]CD Label : CAP-SF3-3 [CR]Main CPU : Hitachi SH2 (possibly 2) [CR]Storage : SCSI CD Rom, RAM and Flash ROM.

Hugo is missing most of his animation frames and moves. His stage background from 2nd Impact is mostly intact, except that the background music being played is from Judgement Day - Gill's stage. Capcom presumably didn't have enough time to finish the Hugo character and decided to keep him for the sequel.[CR]The music from Alex's Stage (Jazzy NYC) contains the famous "Woo! Yeah!" voice sample from James Brown's "Think (About It)"; a sample that became a very popular and important component of Hip-Hop music, specially after the huge success of MC Rob Base &amp; DJ E-Z Rock's "It Takes Two" in the late 80's.[CR]QUOTE LIST :[CR]* Alex :[CR]Talk's cheap. Bluffing will get you nowhere against me.[CR]You're tough, but you can't outlast the best.[CR]You arrogant imbecile, you slacked off right at the end.[CR]You thought you had a chance?  C'mon, everyone knows you're no good.[CR]Just stay down.  Don't try to stand up.  You look pale![CR]I don't know where you trained yourself, but you didn't train hard enough. Those moves suck![CR]Damn!  I can't believe how poorly I fought.  Next time I will really beat the crap out of you![CR]I didn't think I'd have such a hard time with you![CR]I give my all no matter who I fight.[CR]Damn!  Even my sparring partner lasts longer than that![CR]You hit the ground right when I was about to go berserk. Lucky![CR]You say you were out of form? Your excuses are out of control![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : You may have mighty body blows, but you can't hit my vital organs.[CR]to Elena : If you want a man to like you, use those legs for something else.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : You're a pathetic excuse for a ninja.[CR]to Ken : You may be fast, but not fast enough to elude my fists.[CR]to Necro : Your moves are almost as freakin' weird as you are.[CR]to Oro : Control your temper old man.  I will ignore your piddly ass next time.[CR]to Ryu : You... you seem to live for the fight.[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]to Yang : You brothers sure are hot blooded! But you're both still lamers.[CR]* Dudley :[CR]You're down already? The spectators have asked for their shillings back![CR]Shall I awaken you with the waters of the Thames River?[CR]Good show, but it's just not in your blood.[CR]No matter how many times we fight, I'll always pound your limey hide.[CR]To err is human, but to win is noble.[CR]This was my finest hour![CR]'Cowards die often', or so it is said.[CR]The British spirit is an indomitable spirit![CR]I put on the kettle, but you can't even last till tea time.[CR]Another uncouth lout falls between my fists and the pavement.[CR]It seems the grace of victory doesn't love you.[CR]How could you have given me such a tussle?  'Tis not my day!  Time to go home![CR]to Alex : Ah, I just can't stand ill-mannered goons who ignore their grooming![CR]to Dudley : You dared to piss me off.  Was it boldness, or stupidity?[CR]to Elena : Pardon me for my violent behavior... Lady...[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : Not a bad go of things... I enjoyed it, Samurai lass![CR]to Ken : My apologies, but I have no chance but to maul sissy men like you![CR]to Necro :  At first glance you looked like a right good challenge. Appearances can decieve, eh?[CR]to Oro : By my honor, old man.  I swear I did not pull any punches![CR]to Ryu : Sad...The land of the Samurai must have fallen with you.[CR]to Sean : Such a greenhorn!  You left your temple wide open!  Bad form![CR]to Urien :[CR]to Yang : When it comes to lightning action, the speed of boxing is unsurpassed.[CR]to Yun : Your fighting skills are equal to...child's play.[CR]* Elena :[CR]I think we can be friends. You think so too, right?[CR]Are you tone-deaf? I had trouble timing myself to your moves.[CR]I'll never forget about today's fight![CR]African earth is my teacher. You must learn to respect it![CR]Will you fight me again someday?  I think it's wonderful![CR]What did you think of my finishing move?[CR]Did you let me win?  No one can be THAT bad.[CR]It was a great fight!  I wanted it to last forever![CR]I felt your rhythm![CR]You don't have any rhythm![CR]Maybe you should take up some other hobby.  You could try mountain biking.[CR]I was pleased to have fought with you.[CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley: ?[CR]to Elena : I hate copycats![CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Gill :[CR]If you tried harder, maybe you wouldn't fall so quickly. Pathetic![CR]Ignorant of your own incompetence. What a fool![CR]I should have been conquering worlds, not wasting time with the likes of you![CR]I held back, and still you cower on the ground like a peon. What a waste of human life![CR]Look into my eyes. I'll carve the mark of defeat on your brow.[CR]You actually made me pay attention to this fight for a moment.[CR]Not bad, but still you fall short of the perfection I embody.[CR]You call yourself well-trained?  Obviously humans follow the wrong leaders.. Anyone but me![CR]You did well, for one of the sheep.  Challenge me again when you learn from your mistakes.[CR]Are you paralyzed yet?  You're way below my expectations, but that's nothing new.[CR]I admire your courage, but you'd be a fool to challenge me again.[CR]* Ibuki :[CR]Don't underestimate me![CR]There's no second chance in the real fight![CR]Devote yourself to your training.[CR]I'll beat you from behind next time![CR]Even though I won, it was too close a fight.[CR]You don't have enough tenacity for the fight.[CR]Useless try.  You were beaten from the beginning.[CR]Now that you know the special move of the Shinobi, I cannot let you live.[CR]I don't think you can understand what Shinobi moves are all about.[CR]Hesitation in a fraction of a second can kill you.[CR]I'm the best there is![CR]It was my destiny to win.[CR]to Alex : So much for you, Macho Stud!  You sure lost that Power Instinct![CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : You'll get into a lot of trouble if you fight in a half-hearted way.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : Your cute charms won't save you from defeat![CR]to Necro : You use strange moves.  Are you a Shinobi too?[CR]to Oro : May you live long, old man![CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : You're fast, but I'm faster.[CR]* Ken :[CR]What a reckless man you are!  Don' try to execute a jump-kick against me![CR]Now you've learned how to kick your opponent![CR]It's the fighting sense that matters. Time off will never dull my instincts![CR]It was already decided that I would win![CR]I thought you had at least a little potential!  It seems I was wrong![CR]That was too easy![CR]It's not that you were good!  It's that I wasn't trying very hard![CR]I must be getting old to allow someone of your weak ability to almost win![CR]You were good! I almost broke a sweat.[CR]I had an extremely good sense of how the fight would go![CR]You hurt me, but I hurt you worse![CR]Don't be so depressed. You will get better with time.[CR]to Alex: You're not bad! But you're not so good either.  Just average...[CR]to Dudley : Hey old man! Don't even think about fighting me again![CR]to Elena : A lady like you shouldn't act so violently![CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : Did I do something that makes you hate me?[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : You're so interesting...[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : I think we've fought too many times now. When will you accept that I'm better?[CR]to Sean : You have to learn the basic rules of fighting![CR]to Urien: ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : I like a naughty boy like you![CR]* Necro :[CR]My rage was like a white inferno of anger. You will burn.[CR]Screw you bastard! I'm in pain! You'll wish you were never born![CR]Damn, I can't believe I'm breathing hard after fighting your sorry ass![CR]I'll win by any means necessary. I will survive![CR]What are you looking at?  What's your damn problem?[CR]Get outta my way or I'll tear you limb from limb.[CR]Apologize while you can idiot! Say you're sorry and I might forgive you for your crimes.[CR]Don't give me that punk ass attitude. You think I cheated![CR]I can't believe you're already out!  What am I supposed to do with all my rage now?[CR]So boring... I could spare change while kicking your ass without breaking a sweat.[CR]I warned you.  You didn't listen.  The masses of humanity will always suffer... at my hands![CR]No mercy to weekend warriors and pansy freaks![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : Thank you for being my punching bag. You're a true gentleman![CR]to Elena : ?[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : For some reason, I just don't like you blondie![CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : I'm through playing kids games with you. Go home![CR]* Oro :[CR]I used the minimum energy to insure victory.[CR]You were almost worthy of the lies you told about your ability.[CR]You have the power, you just don't know how to use it.[CR]You have to start by learning how to communicate with heaven and earth.[CR]It was over before I knew it. Too bad you weren't one of my students.[CR]You strain yourself too much. Fight without restraint and you will stand a chance.[CR]Show some respect to your elders, whippersnapper![CR]Some call it unearthly abilities. I call it Senjitsu.[CR]I have no time to deal with cretins like you.[CR]I was truly pressed. First time in 10 years I've broken a sweat.[CR]Such a lack of challenge. I thought you had burning passion, but you are devoid of talent.[CR]to Alex : Don't judge your opponents by their appearance. You're just a cocky youth.[CR]to Dudley : Your uppercut you're so proud of moves in slow motion to my eyes.[CR]to Elena : I see potential in you girl. Come on, come closer.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki: You're vicious. Too vicious. You can't touch me.[CR]to Ken : Your fighting spirit is strong. If I could train you like a dog, you might become good some day.[CR]to Necro: Your screwed up face is only entertainment.[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : You remind me of my younger days. I must train you if you are to realize your potential.[CR]to Sean : You're so young! I envy your youth, but not your lack of skill.[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Ryu :[CR]It was a good fight. Challenge me again![CR]These two fists are everything to me![CR]I was not concentrating!  I have not trained hard enough![CR]Get up! Show me your true power![CR]You're wounded.

It makes me stronger![CR]I'm as fast as the wind, as fierce as fire, and as solid as a rock![CR]You lack strength of purpose. Don't despise me![CR]I must learn more.

But next time make it a good fight, and not just a fight.[CR]I did it. No sweat.[CR]I've heard only he of serious mind wins fights.  Your mind is a serious sieve.[CR]Try to look up at the sky. Don't look down or you'll become depressed as you see your lame body.[CR]Enough!  I'm not going to waste my fists on your scurvy face.[CR]What's your problem? You want another fist in the face?[CR]Why am I so strong? Why are you so weak? Why is the sky blue?[CR]Some days are better than others. Today was bad for me but really bad for you.[CR]You want to try again? Sure, you'll just lose again.[CR]I paid you back for the injuries you inflicted on me three times over.[CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : When it comes to fighting, the lines between genders are blurred to me.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : That ninja costume is wasted on your body.[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Yun :[CR]It's only natural that you lost. Rest now.[CR]I can't bear to watch your moves. They're too uncool for words.[CR]Everyone expects the true Kung-Fu master will win.[CR]For once in my life, I have a close one? I must have the sniffles or something.[CR]That was a close one. But you still screwed the pooch.[CR]Your attacks didn't even graze my skin.[CR]It's scary how perfect I am.[CR]Hey you! The one with the weak moves! Are you still alive?[CR]Whew, you scared me. This much.[CR]Sometimes I beat people up too much. Not again![CR]Hey you! Are you done playing around yet?[CR]I've shown you the best moves I've got, the best Kung Fu in the whole world![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : Your speed combined with your great weight is almost unfair. Almost.[CR]to Elena : I've beaten a girl. Grandfather will scold me.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : You look good in that outfit, but good looks aren't everything.[CR]to Ken : Your moves are fun to look at, but easy to stop.[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : Old man, you should be drinking hot tea or something rather than fighting.[CR]to Ryu : You look like you enjoyed being beat![CR]to Sean : Your moves are hard, but they lack polish. You'd better tone up or you'll never win with that junk.[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Here is the list of all versions : [CR]970204[CR]* US, Japan, Asia, and Hispanic releases. [CR]Additional Notes : [CR]The US version has the 'Recycle It, Don't Trash It!' screen. [CR]The Asian version has the "Voice Type" set to off by default in the System Configuration. This causes some Japanese utterances from the characters to be replaced with grunts or silence.

				<plot>Street Fighter III - New Generation (c) 1997 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]A New Generation of Street Fighters! Features larger characters sprites than previous Street Fighter games with the smoothest, most detailed 2-D animation ever made at the time of its release, a level of quality that is yet to be matched by any other 2-D game outside of the Street Fighter III series as of 2004; some complain that too many things are animated and each animation contains too many frames, slowing down the pace of the game.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Capcom Play System III Hardware (CP-S III) [CR]Game ID : CP-S III No. 02 [CR]CD Number : CAP-SF3000 [CR]CD Label : CAP-SF3-3 [CR]Main CPU : Hitachi SH2 (possibly 2) [CR]Storage : SCSI CD Rom, RAM and Flash ROM. [CR]RAM : SIMMs on the left w/ 16M of data each (each has 8x 16M Flash ROMs, there's 4 SIMMs plugged in on this board). SIMMs on the right w/ 8M each (there's 4 Flash ROMs on each board and there are 2 SIMMs plugged in) [CR]OSC : 60MHz. 42.9545MHz, XTAL 3.6864MHz.[CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick [CR]Buttons : 6 [CR]= &gt; [1] LP (Jab), [2] MP (Strong), [3] HP (Fierce) [CR]= &gt; [4] LK (Short), [5] MK (Forward), [6] HK (Roundhouse)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Street Fighter III was released in February 1997.[CR]According to Capcom's flyer for this game, this game has character animations that are animated at 64 frames per second at the maximum.[CR]The marquee simply refers to this game as 'Three'.[CR]Sean was originally supposed to be the only fighter who used the Ryu and Ken's style in the game, Ken and Ryu were added in later by the demand of SF fans.[CR]The enigmatic hoax character Shen Long was revived in Street Fighter III after an issue of EGM that gave an incomplete strategy describing how to face him, and some doctored screen-shots that show Shen Long as an altered Ken or Ryu character model firing multiple hadou waves.[CR]Hugo, first introduced in "Street Fighter III - 2nd Impact", is present in the game code. Hugo is missing most of his animation frames and moves. His stage background from 2nd Impact is mostly intact, except that the background music being played is from Judgement Day - Gill's stage. Capcom presumably didn't have enough time to finish the Hugo character and decided to keep him for the sequel.[CR]The music from Alex's Stage (Jazzy NYC) contains the famous "Woo! Yeah!" voice sample from James Brown's "Think (About It)"; a sample that became a very popular and important component of Hip-Hop music, specially after the huge success of MC Rob Base &amp; DJ E-Z Rock's "It Takes Two" in the late 80's.[CR]QUOTE LIST :[CR]* Alex :[CR]Talk's cheap. Bluffing will get you nowhere against me.[CR]You're tough, but you can't outlast the best.[CR]You arrogant imbecile, you slacked off right at the end.[CR]You thought you had a chance?  C'mon, everyone knows you're no good.[CR]Just stay down.  Don't try to stand up.  You look pale![CR]I don't know where you trained yourself, but you didn't train hard enough. Those moves suck![CR]Damn!  I can't believe how poorly I fought.  Next time I will really beat the crap out of you![CR]I didn't think I'd have such a hard time with you![CR]I give my all no matter who I fight.[CR]Damn!  Even my sparring partner lasts longer than that![CR]You hit the ground right when I was about to go berserk. Lucky![CR]You say you were out of form? Your excuses are out of control![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : You may have mighty body blows, but you can't hit my vital organs.[CR]to Elena : If you want a man to like you, use those legs for something else.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : You're a pathetic excuse for a ninja.[CR]to Ken : You may be fast, but not fast enough to elude my fists.[CR]to Necro : Your moves are almost as freakin' weird as you are.[CR]to Oro : Control your temper old man.  I will ignore your piddly ass next time.[CR]to Ryu : You... you seem to live for the fight.[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]to Yang : You brothers sure are hot blooded! But you're both still lamers.[CR]* Dudley :[CR]You're down already? The spectators have asked for their shillings back![CR]Shall I awaken you with the waters of the Thames River?[CR]Good show, but it's just not in your blood.[CR]No matter how many times we fight, I'll always pound your limey hide.[CR]To err is human, but to win is noble.[CR]This was my finest hour![CR]'Cowards die often', or so it is said.[CR]The British spirit is an indomitable spirit![CR]I put on the kettle, but you can't even last till tea time.[CR]Another uncouth lout falls between my fists and the pavement.[CR]It seems the grace of victory doesn't love you.[CR]How could you have given me such a tussle?  'Tis not my day!  Time to go home![CR]to Alex : Ah, I just can't stand ill-mannered goons who ignore their grooming![CR]to Dudley : You dared to piss me off.  Was it boldness, or stupidity?[CR]to Elena : Pardon me for my violent behavior... Lady...[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : Not a bad go of things... I enjoyed it, Samurai lass![CR]to Ken : My apologies, but I have no chance but to maul sissy men like you![CR]to Necro :  At first glance you looked like a right good challenge. Appearances can decieve, eh?[CR]to Oro : By my honor, old man.  I swear I did not pull any punches![CR]to Ryu : Sad...The land of the Samurai must have fallen with you.[CR]to Sean : Such a greenhorn!  You left your temple wide open!  Bad form![CR]to Urien :[CR]to Yang : When it comes to lightning action, the speed of boxing is unsurpassed.[CR]to Yun : Your fighting skills are equal to...child's play.[CR]* Elena :[CR]I think we can be friends. You think so too, right?[CR]Are you tone-deaf? I had trouble timing myself to your moves.[CR]I'll never forget about today's fight![CR]African earth is my teacher. You must learn to respect it![CR]Will you fight me again someday?  I think it's wonderful![CR]What did you think of my finishing move?[CR]Did you let me win?  No one can be THAT bad.[CR]It was a great fight!  I wanted it to last forever![CR]I felt your rhythm![CR]You don't have any rhythm![CR]Maybe you should take up some other hobby.  You could try mountain biking.[CR]I was pleased to have fought with you.[CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley: ?[CR]to Elena : I hate copycats![CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Gill :[CR]If you tried harder, maybe you wouldn't fall so quickly. Pathetic![CR]Ignorant of your own incompetence. What a fool![CR]I should have been conquering worlds, not wasting time with the likes of you![CR]I held back, and still you cower on the ground like a peon. What a waste of human life![CR]Look into my eyes. I'll carve the mark of defeat on your brow.[CR]You actually made me pay attention to this fight for a moment.[CR]Not bad, but still you fall short of the perfection I embody.[CR]You call yourself well-trained?  Obviously humans follow the wrong leaders.. Anyone but me![CR]You did well, for one of the sheep.  Challenge me again when you learn from your mistakes.[CR]Are you paralyzed yet?  You're way below my expectations, but that's nothing new.[CR]I admire your courage, but you'd be a fool to challenge me again.[CR]* Ibuki :[CR]Don't underestimate me![CR]There's no second chance in the real fight![CR]Devote yourself to your training.[CR]I'll beat you from behind next time![CR]Even though I won, it was too close a fight.[CR]You don't have enough tenacity for the fight.[CR]Useless try.  You were beaten from the beginning.[CR]Now that you know the special move of the Shinobi, I cannot let you live.[CR]I don't think you can understand what Shinobi moves are all about.[CR]Hesitation in a fraction of a second can kill you.[CR]I'm the best there is![CR]It was my destiny to win.[CR]to Alex : So much for you, Macho Stud!  You sure lost that Power Instinct![CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : You'll get into a lot of trouble if you fight in a half-hearted way.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : Your cute charms won't save you from defeat![CR]to Necro : You use strange moves.  Are you a Shinobi too?[CR]to Oro : May you live long, old man![CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : You're fast, but I'm faster.[CR]* Ken :[CR]What a reckless man you are!  Don' try to execute a jump-kick against me![CR]Now you've learned how to kick your opponent![CR]It's the fighting sense that matters. Time off will never dull my instincts![CR]It was already decided that I would win![CR]I thought you had at least a little potential!  It seems I was wrong![CR]That was too easy![CR]It's not that you were good!  It's that I wasn't trying very hard![CR]I must be getting old to allow someone of your weak ability to almost win![CR]You were good! I almost broke a sweat.[CR]I had an extremely good sense of how the fight would go![CR]You hurt me, but I hurt you worse![CR]Don't be so depressed. You will get better with time.[CR]to Alex: You're not bad! But you're not so good either.  Just average...[CR]to Dudley : Hey old man! Don't even think about fighting me again![CR]to Elena : A lady like you shouldn't act so violently![CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : Did I do something that makes you hate me?[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : You're so interesting...[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : I think we've fought too many times now. When will you accept that I'm better?[CR]to Sean : You have to learn the basic rules of fighting![CR]to Urien: ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : I like a naughty boy like you![CR]* Necro :[CR]My rage was like a white inferno of anger. You will burn.[CR]Screw you bastard! I'm in pain! You'll wish you were never born![CR]Damn, I can't believe I'm breathing hard after fighting your sorry ass![CR]I'll win by any means necessary. I will survive![CR]What are you looking at?  What's your damn problem?[CR]Get outta my way or I'll tear you limb from limb.[CR]Apologize while you can idiot! Say you're sorry and I might forgive you for your crimes.[CR]Don't give me that punk ass attitude. You think I cheated![CR]I can't believe you're already out!  What am I supposed to do with all my rage now?[CR]So boring... I could spare change while kicking your ass without breaking a sweat.[CR]I warned you.  You didn't listen.  The masses of humanity will always suffer... at my hands![CR]No mercy to weekend warriors and pansy freaks![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : Thank you for being my punching bag. You're a true gentleman![CR]to Elena : ?[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : For some reason, I just don't like you blondie![CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : I'm through playing kids games with you. Go home![CR]* Oro :[CR]I used the minimum energy to insure victory.[CR]You were almost worthy of the lies you told about your ability.[CR]You have the power, you just don't know how to use it.[CR]You have to start by learning how to communicate with heaven and earth.[CR]It was over before I knew it. Too bad you weren't one of my students.[CR]You strain yourself too much. Fight without restraint and you will stand a chance.[CR]Show some respect to your elders, whippersnapper![CR]Some call it unearthly abilities. I call it Senjitsu.[CR]I have no time to deal with cretins like you.[CR]I was truly pressed. First time in 10 years I've broken a sweat.[CR]Such a lack of challenge. I thought you had burning passion, but you are devoid of talent.[CR]to Alex : Don't judge your opponents by their appearance. You're just a cocky youth.[CR]to Dudley : Your uppercut you're so proud of moves in slow motion to my eyes.[CR]to Elena : I see potential in you girl. Come on, come closer.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki: You're vicious. Too vicious. You can't touch me.[CR]to Ken : Your fighting spirit is strong. If I could train you like a dog, you might become good some day.[CR]to Necro: Your screwed up face is only entertainment.[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : You remind me of my younger days. I must train you if you are to realize your potential.[CR]to Sean : You're so young! I envy your youth, but not your lack of skill.[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Ryu :[CR]It was a good fight. Challenge me again![CR]These two fists are everything to me![CR]I was not concentrating!  I have not trained hard enough![CR]Get up! Show me your true power![CR]You're wounded. The hot springs can heal you quickly.[CR]Put everything you've got in your fist and challenge me![CR]You still have a fighting spirit in your eyes. I look forward to our next battle. The world is big! There must be no limit to human strength.[CR]Your moves are sharp. But I'll deal with them later.[CR]This match... I think I've learned something from this. You're nothing.[CR]What? Out of stamina already?[CR]You can't beat me with those incomplete moves![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : Your body has a wonderful bounce to it![CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : Your ninjitsu differs from the Bushin style, but that's because you're not a guy.[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : Those strange moves won't work on me, I've fought this guy from India![CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Sean :[CR]Hado power! I think I've come to understand it![CR]Don't call me Dan![CR]I did it master! I beat my first opponent![CR]I must defeat everyone![CR]I've reached my potential![CR]When it comes to the fighting spirit, I can not lose![CR]Shoryu-reppa! I'll perfect it next time![CR]Rule#1 : Never give up! Rule#2 : Don't fight me! Rule#3 : Don't be like Dan![CR]I like close fights! It makes me stronger![CR]I'm as fast as the wind, as fierce as fire, and as solid as a rock![CR]You lack strength of purpose. Don't despise me![CR]I must learn more. Where is Ken?[CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : ?[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : Isn't Kung-fu supposed to be the best?[CR]to Yun : Unlike you, I try to defeat the opponent with one punch.[CR]* Yang :[CR]A close one. I almost let you win.[CR]I told you I was strong. You should listen to your superiors.[CR]I was itching for a good fight. Thanks! But next time make it a good fight, and not just a fight.[CR]I did it. No sweat.[CR]I've heard only he of serious mind wins fights.  Your mind is a serious sieve.[CR]Try to look up at the sky. Don't look down or you'll become depressed as you see your lame body.[CR]Enough!  I'm not going to waste my fists on your scurvy face.[CR]What's your problem? You want another fist in the face?[CR]Why am I so strong? Why are you so weak? Why is the sky blue?[CR]Some days are better than others. Today was bad for me but really bad for you.[CR]You want to try again? Sure, you'll just lose again.[CR]I paid you back for the injuries you inflicted on me three times over.[CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : When it comes to fighting, the lines between genders are blurred to me.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : That ninja costume is wasted on your body.[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Yun :[CR]It's only natural that you lost. Rest now.[CR]I can't bear to watch your moves. They're too uncool for words.[CR]Everyone expects the true Kung-Fu master will win.[CR]For once in my life, I have a close one?

				<plot>Street Fighter III - New Generation (c) 1997 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]A New Generation of Street Fighters! Features larger characters sprites than previous Street Fighter games with the smoothest, most detailed 2-D animation ever made at the time of its release, a level of quality that is yet to be matched by any other 2-D game outside of the Street Fighter III series as of 2004; some complain that too many things are animated and each animation contains too many frames, slowing down the pace of the game.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Capcom Play System III Hardware (CP-S III) [CR]Game ID : CP-S III No. 02 [CR]CD Number : CAP-SF3000 [CR]CD Label : CAP-SF3-3 [CR]Main CPU : Hitachi SH2 (possibly 2) [CR]Storage : SCSI CD Rom, RAM and Flash ROM. [CR]RAM : SIMMs on the left w/ 16M of data each (each has 8x 16M Flash ROMs, there's 4 SIMMs plugged in on this board). SIMMs on the right w/ 8M each (there's 4 Flash ROMs on each board and there are 2 SIMMs plugged in) [CR]OSC : 60MHz. 42.9545MHz, XTAL 3.6864MHz.[CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick [CR]Buttons : 6 [CR]= &gt; [1] LP (Jab), [2] MP (Strong), [3] HP (Fierce) [CR]= &gt; [4] LK (Short), [5] MK (Forward), [6] HK (Roundhouse)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Street Fighter III was released in February 1997.[CR]According to Capcom's flyer for this game, this game has character animations that are animated at 64 frames per second at the maximum.[CR]The marquee simply refers to this game as 'Three'.[CR]Sean was originally supposed to be the only fighter who used the Ryu and Ken's style in the game, Ken and Ryu were added in later by the demand of SF fans.[CR]The enigmatic hoax character Shen Long was revived in Street Fighter III after an issue of EGM that gave an incomplete strategy describing how to face him, and some doctored screen-shots that show Shen Long as an altered Ken or Ryu character model firing multiple hadou waves.[CR]Hugo, first introduced in "Street Fighter III - 2nd Impact", is present in the game code. Hugo is missing most of his animation frames and moves. His stage background from 2nd Impact is mostly intact, except that the background music being played is from Judgement Day - Gill's stage. Capcom presumably didn't have enough time to finish the Hugo character and decided to keep him for the sequel.[CR]The music from Alex's Stage (Jazzy NYC) contains the famous "Woo! Yeah!" voice sample from James Brown's "Think (About It)"; a sample that became a very popular and important component of Hip-Hop music, specially after the huge success of MC Rob Base &amp; DJ E-Z Rock's "It Takes Two" in the late 80's.[CR]QUOTE LIST :[CR]* Alex :[CR]Talk's cheap. Bluffing will get you nowhere against me.[CR]You're tough, but you can't outlast the best.[CR]You arrogant imbecile, you slacked off right at the end.[CR]You thought you had a chance?  C'mon, everyone knows you're no good.[CR]Just stay down.  Don't try to stand up.  You look pale![CR]I don't know where you trained yourself, but you didn't train hard enough. Those moves suck![CR]Damn!  I can't believe how poorly I fought.  Next time I will really beat the crap out of you![CR]I didn't think I'd have such a hard time with you![CR]I give my all no matter who I fight.[CR]Damn!  Even my sparring partner lasts longer than that![CR]You hit the ground right when I was about to go berserk. Lucky![CR]You say you were out of form? Your excuses are out of control![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : You may have mighty body blows, but you can't hit my vital organs.[CR]to Elena : If you want a man to like you, use those legs for something else.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : You're a pathetic excuse for a ninja.[CR]to Ken : You may be fast, but not fast enough to elude my fists.[CR]to Necro : Your moves are almost as freakin' weird as you are.[CR]to Oro : Control your temper old man.  I will ignore your piddly ass next time.[CR]to Ryu : You... you seem to live for the fight.[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]to Yang : You brothers sure are hot blooded! But you're both still lamers.[CR]* Dudley :[CR]You're down already? The spectators have asked for their shillings back![CR]Shall I awaken you with the waters of the Thames River?[CR]Good show, but it's just not in your blood.[CR]No matter how many times we fight, I'll always pound your limey hide.[CR]To err is human, but to win is noble.[CR]This was my finest hour![CR]'Cowards die often', or so it is said.[CR]The British spirit is an indomitable spirit![CR]I put on the kettle, but you can't even last till tea time.[CR]Another uncouth lout falls between my fists and the pavement.[CR]It seems the grace of victory doesn't love you.[CR]How could you have given me such a tussle?  'Tis not my day!  Time to go home![CR]to Alex : Ah, I just can't stand ill-mannered goons who ignore their grooming![CR]to Dudley : You dared to piss me off.  Was it boldness, or stupidity?[CR]to Elena : Pardon me for my violent behavior... Lady...[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : Not a bad go of things... I enjoyed it, Samurai lass![CR]to Ken : My apologies, but I have no chance but to maul sissy men like you![CR]to Necro :  At first glance you looked like a right good challenge. Appearances can decieve, eh?[CR]to Oro : By my honor, old man.  I swear I did not pull any punches![CR]to Ryu : Sad...The land of the Samurai must have fallen with you.[CR]to Sean : Such a greenhorn!  You left your temple wide open!  Bad form![CR]to Urien :[CR]to Yang : When it comes to lightning action, the speed of boxing is unsurpassed.[CR]to Yun : Your fighting skills are equal to...child's play.[CR]* Elena :[CR]I think we can be friends. You think so too, right?[CR]Are you tone-deaf? I had trouble timing myself to your moves.[CR]I'll never forget about today's fight![CR]African earth is my teacher. You must learn to respect it![CR]Will you fight me again someday?  I think it's wonderful![CR]What did you think of my finishing move?[CR]Did you let me win?  No one can be THAT bad.[CR]It was a great fight!  I wanted it to last forever![CR]I felt your rhythm![CR]You don't have any rhythm![CR]Maybe you should take up some other hobby.  You could try mountain biking.[CR]I was pleased to have fought with you.[CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley: ?[CR]to Elena : I hate copycats![CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Gill :[CR]If you tried harder, maybe you wouldn't fall so quickly. Pathetic![CR]Ignorant of your own incompetence. What a fool![CR]I should have been conquering worlds, not wasting time with the likes of you![CR]I held back, and still you cower on the ground like a peon. What a waste of human life![CR]Look into my eyes. I'll carve the mark of defeat on your brow.[CR]You actually made me pay attention to this fight for a moment.[CR]Not bad, but still you fall short of the perfection I embody.[CR]You call yourself well-trained?  Obviously humans follow the wrong leaders.. Anyone but me![CR]You did well, for one of the sheep.  Challenge me again when you learn from your mistakes.[CR]Are you paralyzed yet?  You're way below my expectations, but that's nothing new.[CR]I admire your courage, but you'd be a fool to challenge me again.[CR]* Ibuki :[CR]Don't underestimate me![CR]There's no second chance in the real fight![CR]Devote yourself to your training.[CR]I'll beat you from behind next time![CR]Even though I won, it was too close a fight.[CR]You don't have enough tenacity for the fight.[CR]Useless try.  You were beaten from the beginning.[CR]Now that you know the special move of the Shinobi, I cannot let you live.[CR]I don't think you can understand what Shinobi moves are all about.[CR]Hesitation in a fraction of a second can kill you.[CR]I'm the best there is![CR]It was my destiny to win.[CR]to Alex : So much for you, Macho Stud!  You sure lost that Power Instinct![CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : You'll get into a lot of trouble if you fight in a half-hearted way.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : Your cute charms won't save you from defeat![CR]to Necro : You use strange moves.  Are you a Shinobi too?[CR]to Oro : May you live long, old man![CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : You're fast, but I'm faster.[CR]* Ken :[CR]What a reckless man you are!  Don' try to execute a jump-kick against me![CR]Now you've learned how to kick your opponent![CR]It's the fighting sense that matters. Time off will never dull my instincts![CR]It was already decided that I would win![CR]I thought you had at least a little potential!  It seems I was wrong![CR]That was too easy![CR]It's not that you were good!  It's that I wasn't trying very hard![CR]I must be getting old to allow someone of your weak ability to almost win![CR]You were good! I almost broke a sweat.[CR]I had an extremely good sense of how the fight would go![CR]You hurt me, but I hurt you worse![CR]Don't be so depressed. You will get better with time.[CR]to Alex: You're not bad! But you're not so good either.  Just average...[CR]to Dudley : Hey old man! Don't even think about fighting me again![CR]to Elena : A lady like you shouldn't act so violently![CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : Did I do something that makes you hate me?[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : You're so interesting...[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : I think we've fought too many times now. When will you accept that I'm better?[CR]to Sean : You have to learn the basic rules of fighting![CR]to Urien: ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : I like a naughty boy like you![CR]* Necro :[CR]My rage was like a white inferno of anger. You will burn.[CR]Screw you bastard! I'm in pain! You'll wish you were never born![CR]Damn, I can't believe I'm breathing hard after fighting your sorry ass![CR]I'll win by any means necessary. I will survive![CR]What are you looking at?  What's your damn problem?[CR]Get outta my way or I'll tear you limb from limb.[CR]Apologize while you can idiot! Say you're sorry and I might forgive you for your crimes.[CR]Don't give me that punk ass attitude. You think I cheated![CR]I can't believe you're already out!  What am I supposed to do with all my rage now?[CR]So boring... I could spare change while kicking your ass without breaking a sweat.[CR]I warned you.  You didn't listen.  The masses of humanity will always suffer... at my hands![CR]No mercy to weekend warriors and pansy freaks![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : Thank you for being my punching bag. You're a true gentleman![CR]to Elena : ?[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : For some reason, I just don't like you blondie![CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : I'm through playing kids games with you. Go home![CR]* Oro :[CR]I used the minimum energy to insure victory.[CR]You were almost worthy of the lies you told about your ability.[CR]You have the power, you just don't know how to use it.[CR]You have to start by learning how to communicate with heaven and earth.[CR]It was over before I knew it. Too bad you weren't one of my students.[CR]You strain yourself too much. Fight without restraint and you will stand a chance.[CR]Show some respect to your elders, whippersnapper![CR]Some call it unearthly abilities. I call it Senjitsu.[CR]I have no time to deal with cretins like you.[CR]I was truly pressed. First time in 10 years I've broken a sweat.[CR]Such a lack of challenge. I thought you had burning passion, but you are devoid of talent.[CR]to Alex : Don't judge your opponents by their appearance. You're just a cocky youth.[CR]to Dudley : Your uppercut you're so proud of moves in slow motion to my eyes.[CR]to Elena : I see potential in you girl. Come on, come closer.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki: You're vicious. Too vicious. You can't touch me.[CR]to Ken : Your fighting spirit is strong. If I could train you like a dog, you might become good some day.[CR]to Necro: Your screwed up face is only entertainment.[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : You remind me of my younger days. I must train you if you are to realize your potential.[CR]to Sean : You're so young! I envy your youth, but not your lack of skill.[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Ryu :[CR]It was a good fight. Challenge me again![CR]These two fists are everything to me![CR]I was not concentrating!  I have not trained hard enough![CR]Get up! Show me your true power![CR]You're wounded. The hot springs can heal you quickly.[CR]Put everything you've got in your fist and challenge me![CR]You still have a fighting spirit in your eyes. I look forward to our next battle. The world is big! There must be no limit to human strength.[CR]Your moves are sharp. But I'll deal with them later.[CR]This match... I think I've learned something from this. You're nothing.[CR]What? Out of stamina already?[CR]You can't beat me with those incomplete moves![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : Your body has a wonderful bounce to it![CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : Your ninjitsu differs from the Bushin style, but that's because you're not a guy.[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : Those strange moves won't work on me, I've fought this guy from India![CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Sean :[CR]Hado power! I think I've come to understand it![CR]Don't call me Dan![CR]I did it master! I beat my first opponent![CR]I must defeat everyone![CR]I've reached my potential![CR]When it comes to the fighting spirit, I can not lose![CR]Shoryu-reppa! I'll perfect it next time![CR]Rule#1 : Never give up! Rule#2 : Don't fight me! Rule#3 : Don't be like Dan![CR]I like close fights! It makes me stronger![CR]I'm as fast as the wind, as fierce as fire, and as solid as a rock![CR]You lack strength of purpose. Don't despise me![CR]I must learn more. Where is Ken?[CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : ?[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : Isn't Kung-fu supposed to be the best?[CR]to Yun : Unlike you, I try to defeat the opponent with one punch.[CR]* Yang :[CR]A close one. I almost let you win.[CR]I told you I was strong. You should listen to your superiors.[CR]I was itching for a good fight. Thanks! But next time make it a good fight, and not just a fight.[CR]I did it. No sweat.[CR]I've heard only he of serious mind wins fights.  Your mind is a serious sieve.[CR]Try to look up at the sky. Don't look down or you'll become depressed as you see your lame body.[CR]Enough!  I'm not going to waste my fists on your scurvy face.[CR]What's your problem? You want another fist in the face?[CR]Why am I so strong? Why are you so weak? Why is the sky blue?[CR]Some days are better than others. Today was bad for me but really bad for you.[CR]You want to try again? Sure, you'll just lose again.[CR]I paid you back for the injuries you inflicted on me three times over.[CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : When it comes to fighting, the lines between genders are blurred to me.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : That ninja costume is wasted on your body.[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Yun :[CR]It's only natural that you lost. Rest now.[CR]I can't bear to watch your moves. They're too uncool for words.[CR]Everyone expects the true Kung-Fu master will win.[CR]For once in my life, I have a close one? I must have the sniffles or something.[CR]That was a close one. But you still screwed the pooch.[CR]Your attacks didn't even graze my skin.[CR]It's scary how perfect I am.[CR]Hey you! The one with the weak moves! Are you still alive?[CR]Whew, you scared me. This much.[CR]Sometimes I beat people up too much. Not again![CR]Hey you! Are you done playing around yet?[CR]I've shown you the best moves I've got, the best Kung Fu in the whole world![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : Your speed combined with your great weight is almost unfair. Almost.[CR]to Elena : I've beaten a girl. Grandfather will scold me.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : You look good in that outfit, but good looks aren't everything.[CR]to Ken : Your moves are fun to look at, but easy to stop.[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : Old man, you should be drinking hot tea or something rather than fighting.[CR]to Ryu : You look like you enjoyed being beat![CR]to Sean : Your moves are hard, but they lack polish. You'd better tone up or you'll never win with that junk.[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Here is the list of all versions : [CR]970204[CR]* US, Japan, Asia, and Hispanic releases.

				<plot>Street Fighter III - New Generation (c) 1997 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]A New Generation of Street Fighters! Features larger characters sprites than previous Street Fighter games with the smoothest, most detailed 2-D animation ever made at the time of its release, a level of quality that is yet to be matched by any other 2-D game outside of the Street Fighter III series as of 2004; some complain that too many things are animated and each animation contains too many frames, slowing down the pace of the game.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Capcom Play System III Hardware (CP-S III) [CR]Game ID : CP-S III No. 02 [CR]CD Number : CAP-SF3000 [CR]CD Label : CAP-SF3-3 [CR]Main CPU : Hitachi SH2 (possibly 2) [CR]Storage : SCSI CD Rom, RAM and Flash ROM. [CR]RAM : SIMMs on the left w/ 16M of data each (each has 8x 16M Flash ROMs, there's 4 SIMMs plugged in on this board). SIMMs on the right w/ 8M each (there's 4 Flash ROMs on each board and there are 2 SIMMs plugged in) [CR]OSC : 60MHz. 42.9545MHz, XTAL 3.6864MHz.[CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick [CR]Buttons : 6 [CR]= &gt; [1] LP (Jab), [2] MP (Strong), [3] HP (Fierce) [CR]= &gt; [4] LK (Short), [5] MK (Forward), [6] HK (Roundhouse)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Street Fighter III was released in February 1997.[CR]According to Capcom's flyer for this game, this game has character animations that are animated at 64 frames per second at the maximum.[CR]The marquee simply refers to this game as 'Three'.[CR]Sean was originally supposed to be the only fighter who used the Ryu and Ken's style in the game, Ken and Ryu were added in later by the demand of SF fans.[CR]The enigmatic hoax character Shen Long was revived in Street Fighter III after an issue of EGM that gave an incomplete strategy describing how to face him, and some doctored screen-shots that show Shen Long as an altered Ken or Ryu character model firing multiple hadou waves.[CR]Hugo, first introduced in "Street Fighter III - 2nd Impact", is present in the game code. Hugo is missing most of his animation frames and moves. His stage background from 2nd Impact is mostly intact, except that the background music being played is from Judgement Day - Gill's stage. Capcom presumably didn't have enough time to finish the Hugo character and decided to keep him for the sequel.[CR]The music from Alex's Stage (Jazzy NYC) contains the famous "Woo! Yeah!" voice sample from James Brown's "Think (About It)"; a sample that became a very popular and important component of Hip-Hop music, specially after the huge success of MC Rob Base &amp; DJ E-Z Rock's "It Takes Two" in the late 80's.[CR]QUOTE LIST :[CR]* Alex :[CR]Talk's cheap. Bluffing will get you nowhere against me.[CR]You're tough, but you can't outlast the best.[CR]You arrogant imbecile, you slacked off right at the end.[CR]You thought you had a chance?  C'mon, everyone knows you're no good.[CR]Just stay down.  Don't try to stand up.  You look pale![CR]I don't know where you trained yourself, but you didn't train hard enough. Those moves suck![CR]Damn!  I can't believe how poorly I fought.  Next time I will really beat the crap out of you![CR]I didn't think I'd have such a hard time with you![CR]I give my all no matter who I fight.[CR]Damn!  Even my sparring partner lasts longer than that![CR]You hit the ground right when I was about to go berserk. Lucky![CR]You say you were out of form? Your excuses are out of control![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : You may have mighty body blows, but you can't hit my vital organs.[CR]to Elena : If you want a man to like you, use those legs for something else.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : You're a pathetic excuse for a ninja.[CR]to Ken : You may be fast, but not fast enough to elude my fists.[CR]to Necro : Your moves are almost as freakin' weird as you are.[CR]to Oro : Control your temper old man.  I will ignore your piddly ass next time.[CR]to Ryu : You... you seem to live for the fight.[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]to Yang : You brothers sure are hot blooded! But you're both still lamers.[CR]* Dudley :[CR]You're down already? The spectators have asked for their shillings back![CR]Shall I awaken you with the waters of the Thames River?[CR]Good show, but it's just not in your blood.[CR]No matter how many times we fight, I'll always pound your limey hide.[CR]To err is human, but to win is noble.[CR]This was my finest hour![CR]'Cowards die often', or so it is said.[CR]The British spirit is an indomitable spirit![CR]I put on the kettle, but you can't even last till tea time.[CR]Another uncouth lout falls between my fists and the pavement.[CR]It seems the grace of victory doesn't love you.[CR]How could you have given me such a tussle?  'Tis not my day!  Time to go home![CR]to Alex : Ah, I just can't stand ill-mannered goons who ignore their grooming![CR]to Dudley : You dared to piss me off.  Was it boldness, or stupidity?[CR]to Elena : Pardon me for my violent behavior... Lady...[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : Not a bad go of things... I enjoyed it, Samurai lass![CR]to Ken : My apologies, but I have no chance but to maul sissy men like you![CR]to Necro :  At first glance you looked like a right good challenge. Appearances can decieve, eh?[CR]to Oro : By my honor, old man.  I swear I did not pull any punches![CR]to Ryu : Sad...The land of the Samurai must have fallen with you.[CR]to Sean : Such a greenhorn!  You left your temple wide open!  Bad form![CR]to Urien :[CR]to Yang : When it comes to lightning action, the speed of boxing is unsurpassed.[CR]to Yun : Your fighting skills are equal to...child's play.[CR]* Elena :[CR]I think we can be friends. You think so too, right?[CR]Are you tone-deaf? I had trouble timing myself to your moves.[CR]I'll never forget about today's fight![CR]African earth is my teacher. You must learn to respect it![CR]Will you fight me again someday?  I think it's wonderful![CR]What did you think of my finishing move?[CR]Did you let me win?  No one can be THAT bad.[CR]It was a great fight!  I wanted it to last forever![CR]I felt your rhythm![CR]You don't have any rhythm![CR]Maybe you should take up some other hobby.  You could try mountain biking.[CR]I was pleased to have fought with you.[CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley: ?[CR]to Elena : I hate copycats![CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Gill :[CR]If you tried harder, maybe you wouldn't fall so quickly. Pathetic![CR]Ignorant of your own incompetence. What a fool![CR]I should have been conquering worlds, not wasting time with the likes of you![CR]I held back, and still you cower on the ground like a peon. What a waste of human life![CR]Look into my eyes. I'll carve the mark of defeat on your brow.[CR]You actually made me pay attention to this fight for a moment.[CR]Not bad, but still you fall short of the perfection I embody.[CR]You call yourself well-trained?  Obviously humans follow the wrong leaders.. Anyone but me![CR]You did well, for one of the sheep.  Challenge me again when you learn from your mistakes.[CR]Are you paralyzed yet?  You're way below my expectations, but that's nothing new.[CR]I admire your courage, but you'd be a fool to challenge me again.[CR]* Ibuki :[CR]Don't underestimate me![CR]There's no second chance in the real fight![CR]Devote yourself to your training.[CR]I'll beat you from behind next time![CR]Even though I won, it was too close a fight.[CR]You don't have enough tenacity for the fight.[CR]Useless try.  You were beaten from the beginning.[CR]Now that you know the special move of the Shinobi, I cannot let you live.[CR]I don't think you can understand what Shinobi moves are all about.[CR]Hesitation in a fraction of a second can kill you.[CR]I'm the best there is![CR]It was my destiny to win.[CR]to Alex : So much for you, Macho Stud!  You sure lost that Power Instinct![CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : You'll get into a lot of trouble if you fight in a half-hearted way.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : Your cute charms won't save you from defeat![CR]to Necro : You use strange moves.  Are you a Shinobi too?[CR]to Oro : May you live long, old man![CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : You're fast, but I'm faster.[CR]* Ken :[CR]What a reckless man you are!  Don' try to execute a jump-kick against me![CR]Now you've learned how to kick your opponent![CR]It's the fighting sense that matters. Time off will never dull my instincts![CR]It was already decided that I would win![CR]I thought you had at least a little potential!  It seems I was wrong![CR]That was too easy![CR]It's not that you were good!  It's that I wasn't trying very hard![CR]I must be getting old to allow someone of your weak ability to almost win![CR]You were good! I almost broke a sweat.[CR]I had an extremely good sense of how the fight would go![CR]You hurt me, but I hurt you worse![CR]Don't be so depressed. You will get better with time.[CR]to Alex: You're not bad! But you're not so good either.  Just average...[CR]to Dudley : Hey old man! Don't even think about fighting me again![CR]to Elena : A lady like you shouldn't act so violently![CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : Did I do something that makes you hate me?[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : You're so interesting...[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : I think we've fought too many times now. When will you accept that I'm better?[CR]to Sean : You have to learn the basic rules of fighting![CR]to Urien: ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : I like a naughty boy like you![CR]* Necro :[CR]My rage was like a white inferno of anger. You will burn.[CR]Screw you bastard! I'm in pain! You'll wish you were never born![CR]Damn, I can't believe I'm breathing hard after fighting your sorry ass![CR]I'll win by any means necessary. I will survive![CR]What are you looking at?  What's your damn problem?[CR]Get outta my way or I'll tear you limb from limb.[CR]Apologize while you can idiot! Say you're sorry and I might forgive you for your crimes.[CR]Don't give me that punk ass attitude. You think I cheated![CR]I can't believe you're already out!  What am I supposed to do with all my rage now?[CR]So boring... I could spare change while kicking your ass without breaking a sweat.[CR]I warned you.  You didn't listen.  The masses of humanity will always suffer... at my hands![CR]No mercy to weekend warriors and pansy freaks![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : Thank you for being my punching bag. You're a true gentleman![CR]to Elena : ?[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : For some reason, I just don't like you blondie![CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : I'm through playing kids games with you. Go home![CR]* Oro :[CR]I used the minimum energy to insure victory.[CR]You were almost worthy of the lies you told about your ability.[CR]You have the power, you just don't know how to use it.[CR]You have to start by learning how to communicate with heaven and earth.[CR]It was over before I knew it. Too bad you weren't one of my students.[CR]You strain yourself too much. Fight without restraint and you will stand a chance.[CR]Show some respect to your elders, whippersnapper![CR]Some call it unearthly abilities. I call it Senjitsu.[CR]I have no time to deal with cretins like you.[CR]I was truly pressed. First time in 10 years I've broken a sweat.[CR]Such a lack of challenge. I thought you had burning passion, but you are devoid of talent.[CR]to Alex : Don't judge your opponents by their appearance. You're just a cocky youth.[CR]to Dudley : Your uppercut you're so proud of moves in slow motion to my eyes.[CR]to Elena : I see potential in you girl. Come on, come closer.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki: You're vicious. Too vicious. You can't touch me.[CR]to Ken : Your fighting spirit is strong. If I could train you like a dog, you might become good some day.[CR]to Necro: Your screwed up face is only entertainment.[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : You remind me of my younger days. I must train you if you are to realize your potential.[CR]to Sean : You're so young! I envy your youth, but not your lack of skill.[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Ryu :[CR]It was a good fight. Challenge me again![CR]These two fists are everything to me![CR]I was not concentrating!  I have not trained hard enough![CR]Get up! Show me your true power![CR]You're wounded. The hot springs can heal you quickly.[CR]Put everything you've got in your fist and challenge me![CR]You still have a fighting spirit in your eyes. I look forward to our next battle. The world is big! There must be no limit to human strength.[CR]Your moves are sharp. But I'll deal with them later.[CR]This match... I think I've learned something from this. You're nothing.[CR]What? Out of stamina already?[CR]You can't beat me with those incomplete moves![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : Your body has a wonderful bounce to it![CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : Your ninjitsu differs from the Bushin style, but that's because you're not a guy.[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : Those strange moves won't work on me, I've fought this guy from India![CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Sean :[CR]Hado power! I think I've come to understand it![CR]Don't call me Dan![CR]I did it master! I beat my first opponent![CR]I must defeat everyone![CR]I've reached my potential![CR]When it comes to the fighting spirit, I can not lose![CR]Shoryu-reppa! I'll perfect it next time![CR]Rule#1 : Never give up! Rule#2 : Don't fight me! Rule#3 : Don't be like Dan![CR]I like close fights! It makes me stronger![CR]I'm as fast as the wind, as fierce as fire, and as solid as a rock![CR]You lack strength of purpose. Don't despise me![CR]I must learn more. Where is Ken?[CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : ?[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : Isn't Kung-fu supposed to be the best?[CR]to Yun : Unlike you, I try to defeat the opponent with one punch.[CR]* Yang :[CR]A close one. I almost let you win.[CR]I told you I was strong. You should listen to your superiors.[CR]I was itching for a good fight. Thanks! But next time make it a good fight, and not just a fight.[CR]I did it. No sweat.[CR]I've heard only he of serious mind wins fights.  Your mind is a serious sieve.[CR]Try to look up at the sky. Don't look down or you'll become depressed as you see your lame body.[CR]Enough!  I'm not going to waste my fists on your scurvy face.[CR]What's your problem? You want another fist in the face?[CR]Why am I so strong? Why are you so weak? Why is the sky blue?[CR]Some days are better than others. Today was bad for me but really bad for you.[CR]You want to try again? Sure, you'll just lose again.[CR]I paid you back for the injuries you inflicted on me three times over.[CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : When it comes to fighting, the lines between genders are blurred to me.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : That ninja costume is wasted on your body.[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Yun :[CR]It's only natural that you lost. Rest now.[CR]I can't bear to watch your moves. They're too uncool for words.[CR]Everyone expects the true Kung-Fu master will win.[CR]For once in my life, I have a close one? I must have the sniffles or something.[CR]That was a close one. But you still screwed the pooch.[CR]Your attacks didn't even graze my skin.[CR]It's scary how perfect I am.[CR]Hey you! The one with the weak moves! Are you still alive?[CR]Whew, you scared me. This much.[CR]Sometimes I beat people up too much. Not again![CR]Hey you! Are you done playing around yet?[CR]I've shown you the best moves I've got, the best Kung Fu in the whole world![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : Your speed combined with your great weight is almost unfair. Almost.[CR]to Elena : I've beaten a girl. Grandfather will scold me.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : You look good in that outfit, but good looks aren't everything.[CR]to Ken : Your moves are fun to look at, but easy to stop.[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : Old man, you should be drinking hot tea or something rather than fighting.[CR]to Ryu : You look like you enjoyed being beat![CR]to Sean : Your moves are hard, but they lack polish. You'd better tone up or you'll never win with that junk.[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Here is the list of all versions : [CR]970204[CR]* US, Japan, Asia, and Hispanic releases. [CR]Additional Notes : [CR]The US version has the 'Recycle It, Don't Trash It!' screen. [CR]The Asian version has the "Voice Type" set to off by default in the System Configuration. This causes some Japanese utterances from the characters to be replaced with grunts or silence. Set to normal to restore the correct voices to the characters.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Yang : Highlight Yun on the character select screen and then press any Kick button. If done correctly, Yun's character icon should change into Yang.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Street Fighter (1987)[CR]2. Street Fighter II - The World Warrior [B-Board 90629B] (1991)[CR]3.

				<plot>Street Fighter III - New Generation (c) 1997 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]A New Generation of Street Fighters! Features larger characters sprites than previous Street Fighter games with the smoothest, most detailed 2-D animation ever made at the time of its release, a level of quality that is yet to be matched by any other 2-D game outside of the Street Fighter III series as of 2004; some complain that too many things are animated and each animation contains too many frames, slowing down the pace of the game.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Capcom Play System III Hardware (CP-S III) [CR]Game ID : CP-S III No. 02 [CR]CD Number : CAP-SF3000 [CR]CD Label : CAP-SF3-3 [CR]Main CPU : Hitachi SH2 (possibly 2) [CR]Storage : SCSI CD Rom, RAM and Flash ROM. [CR]RAM : SIMMs on the left w/ 16M of data each (each has 8x 16M Flash ROMs, there's 4 SIMMs plugged in on this board). SIMMs on the right w/ 8M each (there's 4 Flash ROMs on each board and there are 2 SIMMs plugged in) [CR]OSC : 60MHz. 42.9545MHz, XTAL 3.6864MHz.[CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick [CR]Buttons : 6 [CR]= &gt; [1] LP (Jab), [2] MP (Strong), [3] HP (Fierce) [CR]= &gt; [4] LK (Short), [5] MK (Forward), [6] HK (Roundhouse)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Street Fighter III was released in February 1997.[CR]According to Capcom's flyer for this game, this game has character animations that are animated at 64 frames per second at the maximum.[CR]The marquee simply refers to this game as 'Three'.[CR]Sean was originally supposed to be the only fighter who used the Ryu and Ken's style in the game, Ken and Ryu were added in later by the demand of SF fans.[CR]The enigmatic hoax character Shen Long was revived in Street Fighter III after an issue of EGM that gave an incomplete strategy describing how to face him, and some doctored screen-shots that show Shen Long as an altered Ken or Ryu character model firing multiple hadou waves.[CR]Hugo, first introduced in "Street Fighter III - 2nd Impact", is present in the game code. Hugo is missing most of his animation frames and moves. His stage background from 2nd Impact is mostly intact, except that the background music being played is from Judgement Day - Gill's stage. Capcom presumably didn't have enough time to finish the Hugo character and decided to keep him for the sequel.[CR]The music from Alex's Stage (Jazzy NYC) contains the famous "Woo! Yeah!" voice sample from James Brown's "Think (About It)"; a sample that became a very popular and important component of Hip-Hop music, specially after the huge success of MC Rob Base &amp; DJ E-Z Rock's "It Takes Two" in the late 80's.[CR]QUOTE LIST :[CR]* Alex :[CR]Talk's cheap. Bluffing will get you nowhere against me.[CR]You're tough, but you can't outlast the best.[CR]You arrogant imbecile, you slacked off right at the end.[CR]You thought you had a chance?  C'mon, everyone knows you're no good.[CR]Just stay down.  Don't try to stand up.  You look pale![CR]I don't know where you trained yourself, but you didn't train hard enough. Those moves suck![CR]Damn!  I can't believe how poorly I fought.  Next time I will really beat the crap out of you![CR]I didn't think I'd have such a hard time with you![CR]I give my all no matter who I fight.[CR]Damn!  Even my sparring partner lasts longer than that![CR]You hit the ground right when I was about to go berserk. Lucky![CR]You say you were out of form? Your excuses are out of control![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : You may have mighty body blows, but you can't hit my vital organs.[CR]to Elena : If you want a man to like you, use those legs for something else.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : You're a pathetic excuse for a ninja.[CR]to Ken : You may be fast, but not fast enough to elude my fists.[CR]to Necro : Your moves are almost as freakin' weird as you are.[CR]to Oro : Control your temper old man.  I will ignore your piddly ass next time.[CR]to Ryu : You... you seem to live for the fight.[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]to Yang : You brothers sure are hot blooded! But you're both still lamers.[CR]* Dudley :[CR]You're down already? The spectators have asked for their shillings back![CR]Shall I awaken you with the waters of the Thames River?[CR]Good show, but it's just not in your blood.[CR]No matter how many times we fight, I'll always pound your limey hide.[CR]To err is human, but to win is noble.[CR]This was my finest hour![CR]'Cowards die often', or so it is said.[CR]The British spirit is an indomitable spirit![CR]I put on the kettle, but you can't even last till tea time.[CR]Another uncouth lout falls between my fists and the pavement.[CR]It seems the grace of victory doesn't love you.[CR]How could you have given me such a tussle?  'Tis not my day!  Time to go home![CR]to Alex : Ah, I just can't stand ill-mannered goons who ignore their grooming![CR]to Dudley : You dared to piss me off.  Was it boldness, or stupidity?[CR]to Elena : Pardon me for my violent behavior... Lady...[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : Not a bad go of things... I enjoyed it, Samurai lass![CR]to Ken : My apologies, but I have no chance but to maul sissy men like you![CR]to Necro :  At first glance you looked like a right good challenge. Appearances can decieve, eh?[CR]to Oro : By my honor, old man.  I swear I did not pull any punches![CR]to Ryu : Sad...The land of the Samurai must have fallen with you.[CR]to Sean : Such a greenhorn!  You left your temple wide open!  Bad form![CR]to Urien :[CR]to Yang : When it comes to lightning action, the speed of boxing is unsurpassed.[CR]to Yun : Your fighting skills are equal to...child's play.[CR]* Elena :[CR]I think we can be friends. You think so too, right?[CR]Are you tone-deaf? I had trouble timing myself to your moves.[CR]I'll never forget about today's fight![CR]African earth is my teacher. You must learn to respect it![CR]Will you fight me again someday?  I think it's wonderful![CR]What did you think of my finishing move?[CR]Did you let me win?  No one can be THAT bad.[CR]It was a great fight!  I wanted it to last forever![CR]I felt your rhythm![CR]You don't have any rhythm![CR]Maybe you should take up some other hobby.  You could try mountain biking.[CR]I was pleased to have fought with you.[CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley: ?[CR]to Elena : I hate copycats![CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Gill :[CR]If you tried harder, maybe you wouldn't fall so quickly. Pathetic![CR]Ignorant of your own incompetence. What a fool![CR]I should have been conquering worlds, not wasting time with the likes of you![CR]I held back, and still you cower on the ground like a peon. What a waste of human life![CR]Look into my eyes. I'll carve the mark of defeat on your brow.[CR]You actually made me pay attention to this fight for a moment.[CR]Not bad, but still you fall short of the perfection I embody.[CR]You call yourself well-trained?  Obviously humans follow the wrong leaders.. Anyone but me![CR]You did well, for one of the sheep.  Challenge me again when you learn from your mistakes.[CR]Are you paralyzed yet?  You're way below my expectations, but that's nothing new.[CR]I admire your courage, but you'd be a fool to challenge me again.[CR]* Ibuki :[CR]Don't underestimate me![CR]There's no second chance in the real fight![CR]Devote yourself to your training.[CR]I'll beat you from behind next time![CR]Even though I won, it was too close a fight.[CR]You don't have enough tenacity for the fight.[CR]Useless try.  You were beaten from the beginning.[CR]Now that you know the special move of the Shinobi, I cannot let you live.[CR]I don't think you can understand what Shinobi moves are all about.[CR]Hesitation in a fraction of a second can kill you.[CR]I'm the best there is![CR]It was my destiny to win.[CR]to Alex : So much for you, Macho Stud!  You sure lost that Power Instinct![CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : You'll get into a lot of trouble if you fight in a half-hearted way.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : Your cute charms won't save you from defeat![CR]to Necro : You use strange moves.  Are you a Shinobi too?[CR]to Oro : May you live long, old man![CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : You're fast, but I'm faster.[CR]* Ken :[CR]What a reckless man you are!  Don' try to execute a jump-kick against me![CR]Now you've learned how to kick your opponent![CR]It's the fighting sense that matters. Time off will never dull my instincts![CR]It was already decided that I would win![CR]I thought you had at least a little potential!  It seems I was wrong![CR]That was too easy![CR]It's not that you were good!  It's that I wasn't trying very hard![CR]I must be getting old to allow someone of your weak ability to almost win![CR]You were good! I almost broke a sweat.[CR]I had an extremely good sense of how the fight would go![CR]You hurt me, but I hurt you worse![CR]Don't be so depressed. You will get better with time.[CR]to Alex: You're not bad! But you're not so good either.  Just average...[CR]to Dudley : Hey old man! Don't even think about fighting me again![CR]to Elena : A lady like you shouldn't act so violently![CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : Did I do something that makes you hate me?[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : You're so interesting...[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : I think we've fought too many times now. When will you accept that I'm better?[CR]to Sean : You have to learn the basic rules of fighting![CR]to Urien: ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : I like a naughty boy like you![CR]* Necro :[CR]My rage was like a white inferno of anger. You will burn.[CR]Screw you bastard! I'm in pain! You'll wish you were never born![CR]Damn, I can't believe I'm breathing hard after fighting your sorry ass![CR]I'll win by any means necessary. I will survive![CR]What are you looking at?  What's your damn problem?[CR]Get outta my way or I'll tear you limb from limb.[CR]Apologize while you can idiot! Say you're sorry and I might forgive you for your crimes.[CR]Don't give me that punk ass attitude. You think I cheated![CR]I can't believe you're already out!  What am I supposed to do with all my rage now?[CR]So boring... I could spare change while kicking your ass without breaking a sweat.[CR]I warned you.  You didn't listen.  The masses of humanity will always suffer... at my hands![CR]No mercy to weekend warriors and pansy freaks![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : Thank you for being my punching bag. You're a true gentleman![CR]to Elena : ?[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : For some reason, I just don't like you blondie![CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : I'm through playing kids games with you. Go home![CR]* Oro :[CR]I used the minimum energy to insure victory.[CR]You were almost worthy of the lies you told about your ability.[CR]You have the power, you just don't know how to use it.[CR]You have to start by learning how to communicate with heaven and earth.[CR]It was over before I knew it. Too bad you weren't one of my students.[CR]You strain yourself too much. Fight without restraint and you will stand a chance.[CR]Show some respect to your elders, whippersnapper![CR]Some call it unearthly abilities. I call it Senjitsu.[CR]I have no time to deal with cretins like you.[CR]I was truly pressed. First time in 10 years I've broken a sweat.[CR]Such a lack of challenge. I thought you had burning passion, but you are devoid of talent.[CR]to Alex : Don't judge your opponents by their appearance. You're just a cocky youth.[CR]to Dudley : Your uppercut you're so proud of moves in slow motion to my eyes.[CR]to Elena : I see potential in you girl. Come on, come closer.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki: You're vicious. Too vicious. You can't touch me.[CR]to Ken : Your fighting spirit is strong. If I could train you like a dog, you might become good some day.[CR]to Necro: Your screwed up face is only entertainment.[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : You remind me of my younger days. I must train you if you are to realize your potential.[CR]to Sean : You're so young! I envy your youth, but not your lack of skill.[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Ryu :[CR]It was a good fight. Challenge me again![CR]These two fists are everything to me![CR]I was not concentrating!  I have not trained hard enough![CR]Get up! Show me your true power![CR]You're wounded. The hot springs can heal you quickly.[CR]Put everything you've got in your fist and challenge me![CR]You still have a fighting spirit in your eyes. I look forward to our next battle. The world is big! There must be no limit to human strength.[CR]Your moves are sharp. But I'll deal with them later.[CR]This match... I think I've learned something from this. You're nothing.[CR]What? Out of stamina already?[CR]You can't beat me with those incomplete moves![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : Your body has a wonderful bounce to it![CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : Your ninjitsu differs from the Bushin style, but that's because you're not a guy.[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : Those strange moves won't work on me, I've fought this guy from India![CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Sean :[CR]Hado power! I think I've come to understand it![CR]Don't call me Dan![CR]I did it master! I beat my first opponent![CR]I must defeat everyone![CR]I've reached my potential![CR]When it comes to the fighting spirit, I can not lose![CR]Shoryu-reppa! I'll perfect it next time![CR]Rule#1 : Never give up! Rule#2 : Don't fight me! Rule#3 : Don't be like Dan![CR]I like close fights! It makes me stronger![CR]I'm as fast as the wind, as fierce as fire, and as solid as a rock![CR]You lack strength of purpose. Don't despise me![CR]I must learn more. Where is Ken?[CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : ?[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : Isn't Kung-fu supposed to be the best?[CR]to Yun : Unlike you, I try to defeat the opponent with one punch.[CR]* Yang :[CR]A close one. I almost let you win.[CR]I told you I was strong. You should listen to your superiors.[CR]I was itching for a good fight. Thanks! But next time make it a good fight, and not just a fight.[CR]I did it. No sweat.[CR]I've heard only he of serious mind wins fights.  Your mind is a serious sieve.[CR]Try to look up at the sky. Don't look down or you'll become depressed as you see your lame body.[CR]Enough!  I'm not going to waste my fists on your scurvy face.[CR]What's your problem? You want another fist in the face?[CR]Why am I so strong? Why are you so weak? Why is the sky blue?[CR]Some days are better than others. Today was bad for me but really bad for you.[CR]You want to try again? Sure, you'll just lose again.[CR]I paid you back for the injuries you inflicted on me three times over.[CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : When it comes to fighting, the lines between genders are blurred to me.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : That ninja costume is wasted on your body.[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Yun :[CR]It's only natural that you lost. Rest now.[CR]I can't bear to watch your moves. They're too uncool for words.[CR]Everyone expects the true Kung-Fu master will win.[CR]For once in my life, I have a close one? I must have the sniffles or something.[CR]That was a close one. But you still screwed the pooch.[CR]Your attacks didn't even graze my skin.[CR]It's scary how perfect I am.[CR]Hey you! The one with the weak moves! Are you still alive?[CR]Whew, you scared me. This much.[CR]Sometimes I beat people up too much. Not again![CR]Hey you! Are you done playing around yet?[CR]I've shown you the best moves I've got, the best Kung Fu in the whole world![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : Your speed combined with your great weight is almost unfair. Almost.[CR]to Elena : I've beaten a girl. Grandfather will scold me.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : You look good in that outfit, but good looks aren't everything.[CR]to Ken : Your moves are fun to look at, but easy to stop.[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : Old man, you should be drinking hot tea or something rather than fighting.[CR]to Ryu : You look like you enjoyed being beat![CR]to Sean : Your moves are hard, but they lack polish. You'd better tone up or you'll never win with that junk.[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Here is the list of all versions : [CR]970204[CR]* US, Japan, Asia, and Hispanic releases. [CR]Additional Notes : [CR]The US version has the 'Recycle It, Don't Trash It!' screen. [CR]The Asian version has the "Voice Type" set to off by default in the System Configuration. This causes some Japanese utterances from the characters to be replaced with grunts or silence. Set to normal to restore the correct voices to the characters.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Yang : Highlight Yun on the character select screen and then press any Kick button.

C'mon, everyone knows you're no good.[CR]Just stay down.  Don't try to stand up.  You look pale![CR]I don't know where you trained yourself, but you didn't train hard enough. Those moves suck![CR]Damn!  I can't believe how poorly I fought.  Next time I will really beat the crap out of you![CR]I didn't think I'd have such a hard time with you![CR]I give my all no matter who I fight.[CR]Damn!  Even my sparring partner lasts longer than that![CR]You hit the ground right when I was about to go berserk. Lucky![CR]You say you were out of form? Your excuses are out of control![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : You may have mighty body blows, but you can't hit my vital organs.[CR]to Elena : If you want a man to like you, use those legs for something else.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : You're a pathetic excuse for a ninja.[CR]to Ken : You may be fast, but not fast enough to elude my fists.[CR]to Necro : Your moves are almost as freakin' weird as you are.[CR]to Oro : Control your temper old man.  I will ignore your piddly ass next time.[CR]to Ryu : You... you seem to live for the fight.[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]to Yang : You brothers sure are hot blooded! But you're both still lamers.[CR]* Dudley :[CR]You're down already? The spectators have asked for their shillings back![CR]Shall I awaken you with the waters of the Thames River?[CR]Good show, but it's just not in your blood.[CR]No matter how many times we fight, I'll always pound your limey hide.[CR]To err is human, but to win is noble.[CR]This was my finest hour![CR]'Cowards die often', or so it is said.[CR]The British spirit is an indomitable spirit![CR]I put on the kettle, but you can't even last till tea time.[CR]Another uncouth lout falls between my fists and the pavement.[CR]It seems the grace of victory doesn't love you.[CR]How could you have given me such a tussle?  'Tis not my day!  Time to go home![CR]to Alex : Ah, I just can't stand ill-mannered goons who ignore their grooming![CR]to Dudley : You dared to piss me off.  Was it boldness, or stupidity?[CR]to Elena : Pardon me for my violent behavior... Lady...[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : Not a bad go of things... I enjoyed it, Samurai lass![CR]to Ken : My apologies, but I have no chance but to maul sissy men like you![CR]to Necro :  At first glance you looked like a right good challenge. Appearances can decieve, eh?[CR]to Oro : By my honor, old man.  I swear I did not pull any punches![CR]to Ryu : Sad...The land of the Samurai must have fallen with you.[CR]to Sean : Such a greenhorn!  You left your temple wide open!  Bad form![CR]to Urien :[CR]to Yang : When it comes to lightning action, the speed of boxing is unsurpassed.[CR]to Yun : Your fighting skills are equal to...child's play.[CR]* Elena :[CR]I think we can be friends. You think so too, right?[CR]Are you tone-deaf? I had trouble timing myself to your moves.[CR]I'll never forget about today's fight![CR]African earth is my teacher. You must learn to respect it![CR]Will you fight me again someday?  I think it's wonderful![CR]What did you think of my finishing move?[CR]Did you let me win?  No one can be THAT bad.[CR]It was a great fight!  I wanted it to last forever![CR]I felt your rhythm![CR]You don't have any rhythm![CR]Maybe you should take up some other hobby.  You could try mountain biking.[CR]I was pleased to have fought with you.[CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley: ?[CR]to Elena : I hate copycats![CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Gill :[CR]If you tried harder, maybe you wouldn't fall so quickly. Pathetic![CR]Ignorant of your own incompetence. What a fool![CR]I should have been conquering worlds, not wasting time with the likes of you![CR]I held back, and still you cower on the ground like a peon. What a waste of human life![CR]Look into my eyes. I'll carve the mark of defeat on your brow.[CR]You actually made me pay attention to this fight for a moment.[CR]Not bad, but still you fall short of the perfection I embody.[CR]You call yourself well-trained?  Obviously humans follow the wrong leaders.. Anyone but me![CR]You did well, for one of the sheep.  Challenge me again when you learn from your mistakes.[CR]Are you paralyzed yet?  You're way below my expectations, but that's nothing new.[CR]I admire your courage, but you'd be a fool to challenge me again.[CR]* Ibuki :[CR]Don't underestimate me![CR]There's no second chance in the real fight![CR]Devote yourself to your training.[CR]I'll beat you from behind next time![CR]Even though I won, it was too close a fight.[CR]You don't have enough tenacity for the fight.[CR]Useless try.  You were beaten from the beginning.[CR]Now that you know the special move of the Shinobi, I cannot let you live.[CR]I don't think you can understand what Shinobi moves are all about.[CR]Hesitation in a fraction of a second can kill you.[CR]I'm the best there is![CR]It was my destiny to win.[CR]to Alex : So much for you, Macho Stud!  You sure lost that Power Instinct![CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : You'll get into a lot of trouble if you fight in a half-hearted way.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : Your cute charms won't save you from defeat![CR]to Necro : You use strange moves.  Are you a Shinobi too?[CR]to Oro : May you live long, old man![CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : You're fast, but I'm faster.[CR]* Ken :[CR]What a reckless man you are!  Don' try to execute a jump-kick against me![CR]Now you've learned how to kick your opponent![CR]It's the fighting sense that matters. Time off will never dull my instincts![CR]It was already decided that I would win![CR]I thought you had at least a little potential!  It seems I was wrong![CR]That was too easy![CR]It's not that you were good!  It's that I wasn't trying very hard![CR]I must be getting old to allow someone of your weak ability to almost win![CR]You were good! I almost broke a sweat.[CR]I had an extremely good sense of how the fight would go![CR]You hurt me, but I hurt you worse![CR]Don't be so depressed. You will get better with time.[CR]to Alex: You're not bad! But you're not so good either.  Just average...[CR]to Dudley : Hey old man! Don't even think about fighting me again![CR]to Elena : A lady like you shouldn't act so violently![CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : Did I do something that makes you hate me?[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : You're so interesting...[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : I think we've fought too many times now. When will you accept that I'm better?[CR]to Sean : You have to learn the basic rules of fighting![CR]to Urien: ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : I like a naughty boy like you![CR]* Necro :[CR]My rage was like a white inferno of anger. You will burn.[CR]Screw you bastard! I'm in pain! You'll wish you were never born![CR]Damn, I can't believe I'm breathing hard after fighting your sorry ass![CR]I'll win by any means necessary. I will survive![CR]What are you looking at?  What's your damn problem?[CR]Get outta my way or I'll tear you limb from limb.[CR]Apologize while you can idiot! Say you're sorry and I might forgive you for your crimes.[CR]Don't give me that punk ass attitude. You think I cheated![CR]I can't believe you're already out!  What am I supposed to do with all my rage now?[CR]So boring... I could spare change while kicking your ass without breaking a sweat.[CR]I warned you.  You didn't listen.  The masses of humanity will always suffer... at my hands![CR]No mercy to weekend warriors and pansy freaks![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : Thank you for being my punching bag. You're a true gentleman![CR]to Elena : ?[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : For some reason, I just don't like you blondie![CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : I'm through playing kids games with you. Go home![CR]* Oro :[CR]I used the minimum energy to insure victory.[CR]You were almost worthy of the lies you told about your ability.[CR]You have the power, you just don't know how to use it.[CR]You have to start by learning how to communicate with heaven and earth.[CR]It was over before I knew it. Too bad you weren't one of my students.[CR]You strain yourself too much. Fight without restraint and you will stand a chance.[CR]Show some respect to your elders, whippersnapper![CR]Some call it unearthly abilities. I call it Senjitsu.[CR]I have no time to deal with cretins like you.[CR]I was truly pressed. First time in 10 years I've broken a sweat.[CR]Such a lack of challenge. I thought you had burning passion, but you are devoid of talent.[CR]to Alex : Don't judge your opponents by their appearance. You're just a cocky youth.[CR]to Dudley : Your uppercut you're so proud of moves in slow motion to my eyes.[CR]to Elena : I see potential in you girl. Come on, come closer.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki: You're vicious. Too vicious. You can't touch me.[CR]to Ken : Your fighting spirit is strong. If I could train you like a dog, you might become good some day.[CR]to Necro: Your screwed up face is only entertainment.[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : You remind me of my younger days. I must train you if you are to realize your potential.[CR]to Sean : You're so young! I envy your youth, but not your lack of skill.[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Ryu :[CR]It was a good fight. Challenge me again![CR]These two fists are everything to me![CR]I was not concentrating!  I have not trained hard enough![CR]Get up! Show me your true power![CR]You're wounded. The hot springs can heal you quickly.[CR]Put everything you've got in your fist and challenge me![CR]You still have a fighting spirit in your eyes. I look forward to our next battle. The world is big! There must be no limit to human strength.[CR]Your moves are sharp. But I'll deal with them later.[CR]This match... I think I've learned something from this. You're nothing.[CR]What? Out of stamina already?[CR]You can't beat me with those incomplete moves![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : Your body has a wonderful bounce to it![CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : Your ninjitsu differs from the Bushin style, but that's because you're not a guy.[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : Those strange moves won't work on me, I've fought this guy from India![CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Sean :[CR]Hado power! I think I've come to understand it![CR]Don't call me Dan![CR]I did it master! I beat my first opponent![CR]I must defeat everyone![CR]I've reached my potential![CR]When it comes to the fighting spirit, I can not lose![CR]Shoryu-reppa! I'll perfect it next time![CR]Rule#1 : Never give up! Rule#2 : Don't fight me! Rule#3 : Don't be like Dan![CR]I like close fights! It makes me stronger![CR]I'm as fast as the wind, as fierce as fire, and as solid as a rock![CR]You lack strength of purpose. Don't despise me![CR]I must learn more. Where is Ken?[CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : ?[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : ?[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : Isn't Kung-fu supposed to be the best?[CR]to Yun : Unlike you, I try to defeat the opponent with one punch.[CR]* Yang :[CR]A close one. I almost let you win.[CR]I told you I was strong. You should listen to your superiors.[CR]I was itching for a good fight. Thanks! But next time make it a good fight, and not just a fight.[CR]I did it. No sweat.[CR]I've heard only he of serious mind wins fights.  Your mind is a serious sieve.[CR]Try to look up at the sky. Don't look down or you'll become depressed as you see your lame body.[CR]Enough!  I'm not going to waste my fists on your scurvy face.[CR]What's your problem? You want another fist in the face?[CR]Why am I so strong? Why are you so weak? Why is the sky blue?[CR]Some days are better than others. Today was bad for me but really bad for you.[CR]You want to try again? Sure, you'll just lose again.[CR]I paid you back for the injuries you inflicted on me three times over.[CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : ?[CR]to Elena : When it comes to fighting, the lines between genders are blurred to me.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : That ninja costume is wasted on your body.[CR]to Ken : ?[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : ?[CR]to Ryu : ?[CR]to Sean : ?[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR]* Yun :[CR]It's only natural that you lost. Rest now.[CR]I can't bear to watch your moves. They're too uncool for words.[CR]Everyone expects the true Kung-Fu master will win.[CR]For once in my life, I have a close one? I must have the sniffles or something.[CR]That was a close one. But you still screwed the pooch.[CR]Your attacks didn't even graze my skin.[CR]It's scary how perfect I am.[CR]Hey you! The one with the weak moves! Are you still alive?[CR]Whew, you scared me. This much.[CR]Sometimes I beat people up too much. Not again![CR]Hey you! Are you done playing around yet?[CR]I've shown you the best moves I've got, the best Kung Fu in the whole world![CR]to Alex : ?[CR]to Dudley : Your speed combined with your great weight is almost unfair. Almost.[CR]to Elena : I've beaten a girl. Grandfather will scold me.[CR]to Hugo : ?[CR]to Ibuki : You look good in that outfit, but good looks aren't everything.[CR]to Ken : Your moves are fun to look at, but easy to stop.[CR]to Necro : ?[CR]to Oro : Old man, you should be drinking hot tea or something rather than fighting.[CR]to Ryu : You look like you enjoyed being beat![CR]to Sean : Your moves are hard, but they lack polish. You'd better tone up or you'll never win with that junk.[CR]to Urien : ?[CR]to Yang : ?[CR]to Yun : ?[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Here is the list of all versions : [CR]970204[CR]* US, Japan, Asia, and Hispanic releases. [CR]Additional Notes : [CR]The US version has the 'Recycle It, Don't Trash It!' screen. [CR]The Asian version has the "Voice Type" set to off by default in the System Configuration. This causes some Japanese utterances from the characters to be replaced with grunts or silence. Set to normal to restore the correct voices to the characters.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Yang : Highlight Yun on the character select screen and then press any Kick button.

				<title_clean>Tenth Degree</title_clean>
				<plot>Tenth Degree (c) 1998 Atari Games Corporation.[CR]Atari's Tenth Degree was to combine the elements of the Tekken and Street Fighter style fighting games with an emphasis on speed. Videogames.com got a chance to see Tenth Degree in its early stages, and even played a few rounds on the arcade machine. The characters were designed in a 3D anime style, with both male and female fighters available. In the early stages, developers were discussing having a super deform mode and some other surprises as well. The characters would have had a variety of fighting styles.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "Atari Vegas" hardware.[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 6[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Tenth Degree (originally to be called "Juko Threat") was to be Atari's apparently failed attempt to join the great 3-D fighter genre. Unfortunately for Atari by 1998 Namco had released "Tekken 3" and "Soul Calibur" and Sega were onto "Virtua Fighter 3" and "Fighting Vipers 2", meaning that unless a 3D fighter really stood out it wasn't going to make an impact at all... It was dropped from production as it just didn't take any money during testing, it had nothing that hadn't been seen before, and the competition was just too advanced by the time it would reach full production.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Game Director: James Goddard (DJames.)[CR]Lead Combat Designer: James Goddard (DJames.)[CR]</plot>

He began playing organized hockey at the age of 6 and by 10 he scored 378 goals and 139 assists in just 85 games with the Nadrofsky Steelers. He entered the WHA (World Hockey Association) on June 12, 1978 and the NHL the following year. During his career, he won 4 Stanley Cups with the Edmonton Oilers, broke many scoring records and was the league's MVP 9 times. He was also the first player to score over 200 points in a season, a feat he accomplished 4 times. Gretzky retired from hockey in 1999. In his last game playing for the New York Rangers against the Pittsburgh Penguins on April 29, 1999, he recorded his 2857th point in his 1487th game and retired with 894 goals and 1963 assists. He is the first and only NHL player to have his jersey number (99) retired league-wide, meaning no player will ever again wear the number 99 again.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Programmers : Steve Bennetts, Terry Farnham, Steve Thomas[CR]Artists : Bob Ingold, Jeremy Mattson, Patrice Moriarity[CR]Producer : Robert Daly[CR]Associate producer : Howard Lehr[CR]Marketing manager : Derryl Depriest[CR]Technician : Dennis Nale[CR]Audio : John Paul, Doug Brandon, Jon Hey[CR]Hardware designers : Steve Correll, Andrew Dyer, Ross Shaffer, Ray Macika, John Lowes[CR]Game testers : Rob Reininger, David Ortiz, Trenton Lewis, Todd Papy, Jesse Meza[CR]Hardware support : Steve Norris, Don Thomas, Jeff Peters, Pat Cox, Betty Purcell, Sam DeVaney, Bobby Kay, Scott Parrish, Gregg Piotrowski, Al Lasko, Sheridan Oursler, Leroy Brown, Rick Meyette[CR]DCS2 sound system : Matt Booty, Ed Keenan[CR]Support programmers : Bruce Rogers, David Shepperd, Robert Birmingham, Mike Albaugh, Mike Lynch, Jason Skiles, Chris Krubel, Forrest Miller[CR]Executive producer : Mark Stepen Pierce[CR]Publicist : Tracy Egan[CR]Additional technicians : Mark Hoendervoogt, Minh Nguyen, Todd Modjeski, Pete Mokris[CR]Mechanical engineers : Mark Gruber, Ralph Perez, Ted Valavanis, Tom Sedor, Chris Bobrowski[CR]Development hardware engineers : Alan Gray, John Moore, Sam Lee, Senthil Vinayagam, Mark Hess[CR]Sr. Engineering Tech. : Patrick Hubbell[CR]Cabinet designers : Nik Ehrlich, Rudy Aguire, Joyce Fluty, Mark Gruber, Pete Takaichi[CR]Motion capture models : Wayne Gretzky, Eddie Mio, Charlie Simmons, Howard Lehr, Steve Thomas, Robert Daly[CR]Video production : Joe Noyes, Greg Allen, Brent Englund, Eric Durfey[CR]Statistics : George Zeimek, Robert Daly[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]Nintendo 64 (1996) : features Arcade and Simulation modes.[CR]</plot>
