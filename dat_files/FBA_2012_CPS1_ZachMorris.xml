That means you can tumble up and down these obstacles (keep on colliding), and if you keep shooting, your shots will go in all directions. This way you can clear up a lot of enemies when you are under pressure (while rolling you are invincible).[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. 1942 (1984) [CR]2. 1943 - Midway Kaisen (1987) [CR]3. 1943 Kai - Midway Kaisen (1988) [CR]4. 1941 - Counter Attack [B-Board 89625B-1] (1990) [CR]5. 19XX - The War Against Destiny [Green Board] (1995) [CR]6. 1944 - The Loop Master [Green Board] (2000)[CR]7. 1942 - Joint Strike (2008, PSN/XBLA)[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Planners : Noritaka Funamizu (Poo), Rekite[CR]Object designers : Shinji Sakashita (Sakashita Thing), Yokota Yokozo, Terukun, Kuribow[CR]Scroll designers : Sadakichi, Marilyn Higuchi, Yuki, Kintarou, Harusan[CR]Character support : Akira Yasuda (Akiman)[CR]Character coordinator : Rekite[CR]Character effects : Yokota Yokozo[CR]Sound composer : Hifumi[CR]Programmers : Makkow, Babel-2, Dome[CR]Game analysers : Akira Nishitani (Nin), Doda Nda Uda[CR]Director : Yoshiki Okamoto (Kihaji Okamoto)[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]Here is a list of Japanese ports.

				<plot>Captain Commando (c) 1991 Capcom Company, Limited. [CR]In this beat'em up, Captain Commando and his three faithful companions travel through various locales on their way to confront the evil Scumocide![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System" hardware.[CR]B-Board #: 91634B-2[CR]Players: Up to 4 simultaneously[CR]Control per player: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons per player: 2[CR]=&gt; [1] Attack, [2] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Captain Commando was released in November 1991 in the Japanese arcades. It was known there as the 17th video game made for the CP-S system.[CR]CAPtain COMmando = CAPCOM [CR]The stages of the game takes place in "Final Fight"'s Metro City, but in the year 2026. [CR]Captain Commando is Capcom's own homage to classic American sci-fi shows and magazines and the work of artists like Frank R. Paul. It was not the only game, though; "Battle Circuit" is even a better example of Capcom's enthusiasm for this stuff. [CR]Each of the player's button on the dedicated 4-player cabinet uses a unique two-in-one play action button design : two large half circle buttons (red &amp; blue) placed straight side by straight side to form one big circle, thus making two buttons look like one big button cut in half vertically. [CR]Mack the Knife's name is based on a song made popular in the mid 1950's by Louis Armstrong, and later by Bobby Darin. [CR]Ginzu the ninja's name comes from the ginzu kitchen knives which were introduced in the 1970's which were made famous by its TV advertising campaign. [CR]Sho (Ginzu the ninja's Japanese name) is probably based on Sho Kosugi who is a Japanese actor who is known for his portrayals of ninjas in various movies in the 1980's. [CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Captain Commando : G.S.M. Capcom 5 - PCCB-00083) on March 21, 1992.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Planners : Akira Yasuda (Akiman), Junichi Ohno (Ohno)[CR]Character Designers : Kurisan, Ouji, Eripyon.

				<plot>&#22823;&#39764;&#30028;&#26449; (c) 1988 Capcom.[CR](Daimakaimura)[CR]Three years have passed since the events of "Makaimura" and Arthur the knight once again finds himself battling against the hideous creatures of Demon World. The demons have now seized the kingdom and Arthur returns home to witness the castle's lone survivor, his beloved Gunievere, murdered by the king of the demons, Lucifer. Arthur once again embarks on a one-man quest to destroy the demonic invaders and save Gunievere's mortal soul. [CR]Game-play is of a very similar vein to that of "Makaimura" - the classic run, jump and shoot action remains intact. Daimakaimura is, however, even more difficult than its already demanding predecessor. Arthur now has access to several new power-ups to aid him on his daunting quest, such as 'Golden Armour' which gives Arthur greater protection from the demons. Additionally, unlike "Makaimura", Arthur can now fire his weapons upwards instead of just left or right and, while jumping, can fire beneath him as well. [CR]The graphics in Daimakaimura are predictably far superior to those of its 1985 prequel, with highly imaginative level design and superbly-drawn, smoothly animated enemies all adding to the game's superb Gothic feel.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System" hardware[CR]B-Board #: 88622B-2[CR]B-Board PALs: DM22A | LWIO[CR]C-Board #: 88622-C-1 (no PALs)[CR]CPS-B #: CPS-B-01 DL-0411-10001[CR]Players: 2 (Alternatively)[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 2[CR]=&gt; [1] Fire, [2] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Daimakaimura was originally released in December 1988 in the Japanese arcades.

				<plot>Cadillacs Kyouryuu Shin Seiki (c) 1993 Capcom.[CR]In this 2-D side-scrolling beat'em up, four earth-minded heroes attempt to stop poachers from harming the dinosaur population.

It was known there as the 25th video game made for the CP-S system.[CR]The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Cadillacs New Dinosaur Century'.[CR]This game is very famous by the name "Mustapha's game" (the main character of the game) in Asia.[CR]Characters based upon the comic 'Xenozoic Tales' created in the late eighties by Mark Schultz.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Tenchi Wo Kurau II : G.S.M. Capcom 7 - PCCB-00133) on August 20, 1993.[CR]Exported as "Cadillacs and Dinosaurs [B-Board 91635B-2]".[CR]There is also an unofficial Chinese version known as "Dinosaur Hunter".[CR]There is a modified version of this game (hack?), in which certain gun(s) have unlimited ammo.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]On the 2nd and 5th stages, there appears a large dinosaur called a Shivat that's sleeping when first encountered. Try to keep the human enemies from whacking them to wake them up. While the Shivats do attack the enemies, they can also cause trouble (and injuries) for the players.[CR]There are also some pterodactyl-like flying creatures that need to be struck by jumping to reach them. Whenever you drain the energy from any menacing dinosaurs, they slightly change color, then become harmless.[CR]On the 3rd stage, where you're driving Jack's Cadillac, try to dodge the grenades thrown by the stage's motorcycle-riding boss, Hogg, while crashing into him with the car. If you're good at this, you should be able to at least reduce his energy to the yellow level, the lowest for the enemies.[CR]On the 6th stage, there's 2 points at where you need to be careful not to be stomped on by the legs of a brontosaurus. But, try to lure some of the other enemies underneath them instead![CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Planning : DA., Hattari, JRA[CR]Object GFX : Kurisan, Jun Matsumura (Jun), Matano, Ss, Shisui, Kinmon, The Who[CR]Scroll GFX : Nissui, Konomi, Ohnicchan, Bentobucho[CR]Programmers : Yuki Saiko, Cky Gi-u, T.

				<plot>Final Fight (c) 1989 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]Jessica, the daughter of the city Mayor Mike Haggar has been kidnapped by the evil 'Mad Gear' gang. Set in the fictional Metro City, Haggar rounds up two of his closest friends, Guy and Cody, and sets out to battle Mad Gear's gang members and ultimately rescue his daughter.[CR]1 or 2 players choose to play as either Guy, Cody or Haggar in this superb, sideways scrolling beat-em-up. As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is powerful enough to fell several enemies at once, but with the trade-off that each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's energy is lost. Energy levels can be replenished by finding the food that lies hidden in certain crates and barrels. Some of the Mad Gear gang members will drop a weapon when they are felled. These weapons can then be picked up and used by the players.[CR]After the benchmark-setting "Double Dragon", released by Technos in 1987, Final Fight would become the standard-bearer of the scrolling beat-em-up genre. Featuring a large variety of distinctive, well animated characters moving through colorful and detailed backgrounds, and with a control system that is as intuitive as it is complex, Final Fight is still considered to be the finest example of its kind.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System" hardware.[CR]B-Board ID: 88622B-3[CR]Players: Up to 2 simultaneously.[CR]Control per player: 8-way joystick.[CR]Buttons per player: 3.[CR]=&gt; [1] Attack, [2] Jump, [3] Release (when grabbed by enemies).[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Final Fight was released in December 1989 in the Japanese arcades. It was known there as the 8th video game made for the CP System.[CR]This game was originally billed as the sequel to "Street Fighter" and was to be called "Street Fighter '89". While the game had become a major hit in its own right, Capcom decided to change the name to "Final Fight" and save the "Street Fighter" name for another game, 2 years later. [CR]Guy's name is written with the kanji meaning 'victory song'. The character of Guy has been allegedly inspired by the lead singer of the post hardcore group Fugazi, Guy Picciotto. [CR]The enemy character, Andore, and all of his relatives (Andore Jr., Uncle Andore, Father Andore and Grandfather Andore) are Capcom's homage to the now late WWF Champion, Andre Rene Roussimoff, better known as 'Andre the Giant'. [CR]Two other Mad Gear characters, Axl and Slash, are parodies of the lead singer and guitarist respectively from American rock band, 'Guns N' Roses'. [CR]Poison is taken from the glam rock group of the '80s, in which the singer used to wear a similar hat to the female character in the game. The character Poison is actually a male transvestite and so is Roxy (although a translation error in the Capcom Classics Collection character profiles refers to Roxy as a female). [CR]Abigail is a King Diamond album, whose singer (King Diamond) resembles the character in the game. [CR]Sodom is a famous German thrash metal band founded in the eighties. [CR]The enemy character 'Two P' appears in "Forgotten Worlds" as the second player ('Two P' for 2P, 'Player 2').[CR]The game shares a similar plot with the 1984 movie 'Streets of Fire' directed by Walter Hill. Starring : Michael Par&#233;, Diane Lane, Rick Moranis and Willem Dafoe. Here's a list of the things the movie and the game have in common (Warning! Contains movie spoilers) : [CR]1) The main character played by Michael Par&#233; is named 'Tom Cody' and resembles the game character. Wears jeans and a white shirt at some points during the movie. [CR]2) The city is plagued by gangs and a motorcycle gang kidnaps Cody's Ex girlfriend. [CR]3) The cop that arranges a meeting between Cody and the Gang's boss is nothing other than a corrupted cop by the name of 'Ed Price', the only Cop in the game is called 'Eddie'. [CR]4) The city has an old and trashed look similar to the game. [CR]5) At the end of the movie, Cody leaves the girl just like in the game. Only this time there is no 'Guy' to stop him from leaving (see Final Fight ending sequence)[CR]Known re-release: "Final Fight [B-Board 89625B-1]"[CR]Known Export release: "Final Fight [B-Board 89624B-3]"[CR]A bootleg of this game is known as "Final Crash". [CR]Before the release of "Final Fight", Capcom released a vertically scrolling driving/shoot-em-up called "Mad Gear". [CR]Pony Canyon/Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Final Fight : G.S.M. Capcom 3 - PCCB-00030) on May 21, 1990.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]First revision:[CR]* No Build Date screen.[CR]Second revision:[CR]* Buid Date screen added.[CR]* Build date: 900112[CR]Third revision:[CR]* Build date: 900305[CR]Fourth revision:[CR]* Build date: 900613[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* At the front of the train of Level 2, stand on the barrel and let the clock get to about 45. You will skip the section without defeating the Mad Gear guys. [CR]* Special Endings : Finish the game without having to continue to see an additional credit sequence (meet the staff). [CR]* Hidden Stuff : [CR]Gaining extra points : To gain jewels and other high points items from breakable stuff like barrels, dustbins. Execute the jump+down attack move. (Cody - headbutt, Guy - Elbow). When doing the move, rapidly jag controller left to right. Usually, jewels will appear instead of other cheap things. [CR]Crewing Gum : When fighting Eddie B. (Cop), you will notice that he spit out a wad of gum. That thing will give you about half a life if you pick it up. [CR]Last Boss : Cody is able to punch away the bolts that the last boss fires. No other character can do it. [CR]Off the wall attack : Besides doing the normal off the wall flying kick, you can change it into a flying elbow drop by doing down+attack. [CR]Hidden Gems : On the way to the last boss, there is a stage when there are some pillars. Located at the bottom of each pillar are gems. Make sure you get them. [CR]* Super Combo : This super combo can be easily executed with Cody or Guy, but it's a bit tougher with Haggar. To begin, initiate a punching combo (press attack, attack, attack for Cody or Guy) or (attack, attack for Haggar.) While you're pressing these buttons, hold the D-pad AWAY from your enemy. Before you do your final ending combo blow, you will throw the enemy, delivering massive damage! [CR]Note : You can also start this combo with a jumping knee (jump and hold down, press attack) to deal even more damage! (This will not work for Haggar). [CR]There's an easier way to do this: simply pull the joystick down while punching and the combo will finish throwing the enemy. [CR]* Cody is the only character who can attack with a knife without throwing it. Press Attack while standing next to an enemy to stab them.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

[CR]* Hidden Stuff : [CR]Gaining extra points : To gain jewels and other high points items from breakable stuff like barrels, dustbins. Execute the jump+down attack move. (Cody - headbutt, Guy - Elbow). When doing the move, rapidly jag controller left to right. Usually, jewels will appear instead of other cheap things. [CR]Crewing Gum : When fighting Eddie B. (Cop), you will notice that he spit out a wad of gum. That thing will give you about half a life if you pick it up. [CR]Last Boss : Cody is able to punch away the bolts that the last boss fires. No other character can do it. [CR]Off the wall attack : Besides doing the normal off the wall flying kick, you can change it into a flying elbow drop by doing down+attack. [CR]Hidden Gems : On the way to the last boss, there is a stage when there are some pillars. Located at the bottom of each pillar are gems. Make sure you get them. [CR]* Super Combo : This super combo can be easily executed with Cody or Guy, but it's a bit tougher with Haggar. To begin, initiate a punching combo (press attack, attack, attack for Cody or Guy) or (attack, attack for Haggar.) While you're pressing these buttons, hold the D-pad AWAY from your enemy. Before you do your final ending combo blow, you will throw the enemy, delivering massive damage! [CR]Note : You can also start this combo with a jumping knee (jump and hold down, press attack) to deal even more damage! (This will not work for Haggar). [CR]There's an easier way to do this: simply pull the joystick down while punching and the combo will finish throwing the enemy. [CR]* Cody is the only character who can attack with a knife without throwing it. Press Attack while standing next to an enemy to stab them.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

[CR]Warning : If you launch a desperation attack (attack+jump), all the effort will be lost. [CR]Then wait until the Bird Man comes run against you. Hit him with a strong strike (Push front+punch). Don't hit him while is recovering. Wait until he runs to you again and make the same. you can kill him after 3 strikes (unless with Lancelot). [CR]If you're done correctly, hit the barricade of the above, don't pick the food, try to turn apart it, and you'll get a surprise... a chess piece with 2 lives (2Up) waiting for you. [CR]If you kill the second Bird-Man in the same way, the second item in the barricade will give you 1 more level (green sceptre). [CR]If you remember, a 3rd Bird-Man gets into the castle when you break the bridge's barricade.

				<title_clean>The King of Dragons</title_clean>
				<plot>The King of Dragons (c) 1991 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]Five Mythical warriors take up arms against the evil dragon, Gildiss and his hordes of protective monsters. Features a level-up system and the ability to switch characters at various points in the game.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Capcom Play System Hardware (CP-S)[CR]B-Board #: 89625B-1[CR]Players: Up to 3 simultaneous[CR]Control per player: 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons per player: 2[CR]=&gt; [1] Attack, [2] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]The King of Dragons was released in July 1991 in the Japanese arcades. It was known there as the 15th video game made for this system.[CR]Known re-release: "The King of Dragons [B-Board 90629B-3]"[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Captain Commando : G.S.M. Capcom 5 - PCCB-00083) on March 21, 1992.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Strange Item :[CR]Ice Star : sometimes in 2P mode at second stage, an ice star appears after breaking the wood cask. It seems it only restores energy like a fruit.  [CR]Gold Gauntlet : sometimes at fourth stage, a gold gauntlet appears after breaking the second-last chest. It seems useless. [CR]Cutpurse's Sack : it's a small sack with a light blue question mark that is dropped by Cutpurses after they get hit during the game. A hidden trick or simply a Capcom's joke? [CR]* Gaining extra points :[CR]1) Eat a fruit or a elixir at full energy: this gives 5000 experience points.[CR]2) Hit flying objects like wolves archers arrows, skeletons lances and knights archers arrows.[CR]3) Hit Cutpurse : they take away items like gold's sacks, rubys, pearls, gems, diamonds and fruits.[CR]4) Kill all the green lizard spearmen during the battle with the Wyvern at fourteenth stage (they can release a lot of diamonds or precious).[CR]5) Hit Gildiss fireballs : some of these turns into green apples that at full full energy gives 5000 experience points each-one.[CR]6) Don't use magic attacks or magic crystals at bosses : these kinds of attacks are incredibly more powerful than normal attacks so a boss needs many less hits to kill him.[CR]* BOSSES and POWER-UP WEAPON STRATEGY : middle or end level bosses give experience points for each hit taken while normal monsters give experience points ONLY when they die (it has no matter how strong is the attack, they give ALWAYS the same experience points). [CR]- With Elf, Fighter, Cleric and Dwarf : DON'T power-up your weapon during the game and ALWAYS use the LEVEL-1 WEAPON. So a boss needs many more hits to kill him (remember? more hits &gt; more experience points). To gain extra point it has no matter if character power-up or not bow (for Elf) or shield (for Fighter, Cleric and Dwarf).[CR]- With Wizard : DON'T power-up your weapon during the game and use the LEVEL-1 WEAPON until the wizard can take the LEVEL-5 WEAPON (a wood staff with metal headpiece and red gem/orange flame). This weapon isn't much powerful but a singular attack to a boss increases three times the experience points for each hit. [CR]* INFINITE WOLVES ARCHERS TRICK: At the beginning of the sixth stage on the beach, don't go forward but wait. After a few seconds a blue wolf archer appears and after you kill him, another appears then another one in sequence (then two wolves at a time, then three at a time and then four at a time) to infinity. One single wolf is equal to 1300 experience points, so the player can accumulate points and win a life every 450k points. If the player wants to squeeze millions of points he has to kill wolves very fast and win a life before the timer reaches zero. Then after he rises again with a new life, he starts again to kill wolves and repeats in the same method.[CR]- In the early 'World revision' (July 1991). (Time doesn't run faster when the 'GO cursor' is flashing, so player can kill wolves without going forward (but he isn't forced to do it).[CR]- In the World, Japanese (August 1991) and US revision (September 1991): Time runs faster when the 'GO cursor' is flashing, so the player is forced to go forward step by step, kill a pair of wolves and before the next 'GO cursor' is flashing once, go forward step by step again (this method is very hard).[CR]ADDITIONAL NOTES : Each character has a maximum of 24 level-up during all the game. This means a full bar of energy with 96 Health Point.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Music Composer: Yoko Shimomura[CR]Other staffs: Chin, Tomoshi, Tolaya, Gyo, Shimopi, HK, Yama, Mikiman, Miyao, Iwai, SSS, Mizuho, Hayashi, Manbou, Guych, Dany, Blbon, Ogachy, Hirabe, Wakio[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles : [CR]Nintendo Super Famicom [JP] (March 4, 1994) "The King of Dragons [Model SHVC-EI]" [CR]Nintendo SNES [US] (April 1994) "The King of Dragons [Model SNS-EI-USA]" [CR]Nintendo SNES [EU] (August 1994) "The King of Dragons [Model SNSP-EI-NOE]"[CR]Microsoft XBOX [US] (November 24, 2006) "Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [US] (November 24, 2006) "Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 [Model SLUS-21473]" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [AU] (April 11, 2007) "Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 [Model SLES-54561]" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [EU] (April 13, 2007) "Capcom Classics Collection Vol. 2 [Model SLES-54561]" [CR]* Handhelds : [CR]Sony PSP [JP] (September 7, 2006) "Capcom Classics Collection [Model ULJM-05104]" [CR]Sony PSP [US] (October 24, 2006) "Capcom Classics Collection Reloaded [Model ULUS-10134]" [CR]Sony PSP [EU] (November 10, 2006) "Capcom Classics Collection Reloaded [Model ULES-00377]" [CR]Sony PSP [AU] (November 16, 2006) "Capcom Classics Collection Reloaded"[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Muscle Bomber - The Body Explosion (c) 1993 Capcom.[CR]A 1-on-1 fighting game in which players choose from 10 different wrestlers and take to the ring to try and defeat their larger-than-life opponents. Each wrestler has an assortment of moves, including his own special 'super slam'. The object of the game is to win and defend the championship by pinning or putting a submission hold on your opponent.[CR]There are 2 different game modes to select and play : Single Match or Tag Team 'Battle Royal'. In Single Match, players choose to be one of eight wrestlers including 'Mike Hagger', 'Alexander The Grater', 'El Stingray', 'King Rasta Mon', 'Titanic Tim', 'Gunloc', 'Biff Bolshevik' and 'The Great Oni' ('Jumbo Jack' and 'The Scorpion' cannot be selected in this game).[CR]Once a wrestler has been selected, players will compete in a world-wide tournament against the other 9 wrestlers (including 'Jumbo Jack' and 'The Scorpion') in respective matches. In each match, players must defeat each of their respective opponents by a pinfall, count-out or submission in order to proceed to each of the following matches. Once all opponents are defeated, the winner will be crowned champion and players will have to face all opponents again to defend their title.[CR]In Tag Team 'Battle Royal', players can choose to play as any 2 of the 10 wrestlers for their tag team, including 'Jumbo Jack' and 'The Scorpion'. Here, the player and his or her partner have to eliminate both of the 2 wrestlers on the opposing tag team, in order to win the match and proceed to the next. During these matches, if the player is eliminated before his or her partner is, the match will be declared no contest and it will be a draw.[CR]During each bout in this game, metal buckets and/or glass bottles will sometimes be thrown into the ring which can be picked by the players' wrestler(s) and used as weapons against their opponents.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System" hardware.[CR]B-Board #: 91634B-2[CR]# of Players: Up to 4[CR]Type of controls (per player): 8-way joystick[CR]# of buttons (per player): 3[CR]=&gt; [1] Attack, [2] Jump, [3] Pin[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Muscle Bomber was released in July 1993 in the Japanese arcades. It was known there as the 27th video game made for CP-S system. It is known outside Japan as "Saturday Night Slam Masters".[CR]Hara Tetsuo, who designed the characters in the Muscle Bomber games, is a popular manga artist in Japan. He is famous for his work on 'Hokuto no Ken' (aka 'Fist of the North Star').[CR]Some characters in the game are based on real life wrestlers. Such examples are the Great Oni, who is based on legendary Japanese wrestler the Great Muta, El Stingray, who is based on Mexican wrestler Lizmark, Alexander the Grater is based on former WCW and IWGP world champion Big Van Vader, and Jumbo Flapjack is based on the late Canadian wrestler Earthquake.[CR]One of the wrestlers is Mike Haggar from the game Final Fight. Also, one of the wrestlers named Gunloc is related to Guile from Street Fighter II. Additionally his clone, named Biff, is a friend of Zangief from Street Fighter II.[CR]King Rasta Mon was the original design for Street Fighter II character Blanka, but rejected later on in favor of the most 'beast-like' design.[CR]Biff Slamkovich appears in the background of Ken's stage in "Street Fighter Alpha 2".[CR]Default highscore table :[CR]CHAMP 100000 CAP[CR]1st 95000 COM[CR]2nd 90000 C P[CR]3rd 85000 SYS[CR]4th 80000 TEM[CR]5th 75000 TOM[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Muscle Bomber - PCCB-00136) on September 17, 1993.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Magic Sword - Heroic Fantasy (c) 1990 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]The land has been cast in darkness by Drokmar, who has been corrupted by the Black Orb; an artefact that promises immortality to anyone who comes under the influence of the orb's powerful sorcery. Two warriors set out to fight their way through fifty levels of platform beat-em-up, in order to destroy the orb - which lies at the top of the Dragon Tower - and free their lands.[CR]Treasure chests litter the levels which, when smashed open, release treasure items, magic power-ups, keys, food and weapons. As players fight their way through the levels, they will come across a number of trapped prisoners. As long as the heroes are carrying keys, prisoners can be released who will then fight alongside the players, with each prisoner possessing their own unique attacks. Weapons and power-ups can be picked up to aid players in their quest and food can be found and eaten to increase player health.[CR]As the players ascend the tower, they will be granted new magical weapons after each boss they defeat. The player's weapons are affected by a 'magic bar' that charges over time. When fully charged, the weapon has a powerful ranged attack, but when not charged only a close attack is produced. A magical staff will grant increased range attack ability. A magical blast may be generated by pressing the Attack and Jump buttons at once, but costs health.[CR]There are multiple paths in the game, and two separate endings. Hidden doors can be used to skip levels when found - usually by attacking a wall or a particular spot.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System" hardware.[CR]B-Board ID: 89625B-1[CR]Players: Up to 2 simultaneously.[CR]Control per player: 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons per player: 2[CR]=&gt; [1] Attack, [2] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Magic Sword was released in June 1990 in the Japanese arcades. It was known there as the 11th video game made for the CP-S system.[CR]Known Export release: "Magic Sword - Heroic Fantasy [B-Board 89624B-3]"[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Street Fighter II : G.S.M. Capcom 4 - PCCB-00056) on March 21, 1991.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Magic Sword items :[CR]1) King crown : magical protection.[CR]2) Gauntlet : increase power.[CR]3) Golden pot : healing magic for partner.[CR]4) Crystal ball : detect treasure boxes.[CR]5) Pedant : double score.[CR]6) Magic potion : increases magic skill.[CR]7) Bell : summons a hostile Lizardman to tame. If you have the Diamond Ring equipped he will kneel to accept you as a partner.[CR]8) Diamond Ring : see Bell.[CR]9) Scroll : brings good luck.[CR]* Partners :[CR]1) Big Man : is strong and has great endurance. His boomerang axe is powerful but slow.[CR]2) Ninja : throws 2 to 5 stars which rebound from walls and ceiling. Fast but not so powerful.[CR]3) Amazon : fires her crossbow continuously. Her attack is swift but lacking in power.[CR]4) Thief : is able to locate hidden treasure chests and traps. His bomb packs quite a wallop, too.[CR]6) Knight : is incredibly adept with his spear and is your strongest ally. He is held in the upper level of the tower.[CR]7) Priest : lacks physical strength and speed but his holy bullets can do grave damage to undead monsters.[CR]8) Wizard : shoots magical missiles. He has the most powerful attack but is slow and not much to speak physically.[CR]9) Lizardman : becomes an ally only when bribed with a diamond ring. He is a brute with great strength, speed and attacking power.[CR]* Secret Doors :[CR]Floor 7 - When you enter the floor, walk left and hit the column. warp to level 11.[CR]Floor 17 - Slash the left side of the last arch. Warps to floor 20.[CR]Floor 21 - Between the imprisoned (knight) and the exit, jump left from the elevated ground while slashing.

Enters RED floors 41 to 46.[CR]* An extra 1,000,000 points! is available on blue level 30 : there is a wizard there who levitates rocks. Jump and sword him once, and then when he causes the rocks to appear, use magic (both buttons) to turn the rocks into 8K gold pieces. You can do this until time runs out.[CR]* On level 14, go to the second 'door' with a head on top of it, jump and hit the 'nose' several times and two gems will drop down worth 80,000 a piece.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Game designers : Yoshimi Ohnishi, Tomoshi Sadamoto, Yoshiki Okamoto[CR]Character designers : Kurisan, E.

				<plot>Pang! 3 - Kaitou Tachi no Karei na Gogo (c) 1995 Mitchell.[CR]The second sequel to the superb 1989 original, Pang! 3 retains the same gameplay of its predecessors but adds vastly improved graphics and a choice of three difficulty levels; Beginner, Normal and Panic. On both the 'Normal' and 'Panic' skill levels, players can choose from 4 different playable characters; each possessing different strengths and weaknesses, such as a double harpoon or quick shots. On the beginner level, players can only use the Mexican character.[CR]Another notable difference is in the game's use of backdrops : instead of the world landmarks of the first two games, Pang! 3 features classical works of art in the form of paintings and sculptures.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System" hardware.[CR]B-Board #: 94916-10[CR]Players: Up to 2[CR]Control per player: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons per player: 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Pang! 3 was released in May 1995 in the Japanese arcades.

				<title_clean>The Punisher</title_clean>
				<plot>The Punisher (c) 1993 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]The Punisher is a side-scrolling beat-em-up based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, in which one or two players take on the role of either 'The Punisher' or 'Nick Fury' and must battle through six dangerous locales filled with violent criminal gangs, leading to a final confrontation with criminal mastermind, 'The Kingpin'.[CR]As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is powerful enough to fell several enemies at once, with the trade-off that each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's energy is lost. Energy levels can be replenished by finding food that lies hidden in some of the background objects that litter the levels.[CR]Many enemies carry weapons, such as axes, baseball bats, swords and knives and should players manage to knock these from the enemies' hands, the heroes can pick up the weapons and use them against the enemies. In keeping with their comic book counterparts, each player character also carries a handgun; this only comes into play when confronted with gun-wielding enemies, at which point the players' guns are drawn automatically. Once the gun-carrying enemies have been killed, the players' guns are automatically re-holstered.[CR]A large and powerful gang boss awaits the heroes at the end of each stage. The five gang bosses are Scully, Guardroid, Bonebreaker, Bushwacker and Guardroid 2. The sixth and final level takes place in The Kingpin's lair, ending with a showdown with the criminal mastermind himself.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System" hardware.[CR]B-Board #: 91634B-2[CR]# of players: Up to 2 simultaneous.[CR]Type of control (per player): 8-Way Joystick[CR]# of buttons (per player): 2 [CR]=&gt; [1] Attack, [2] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]The Punisher was released in April 1993 in the Japanese arcades. It was known there as the 26th video game made for this system.[CR]Exported as "The Punisher [B-Board 91635B-2]".[CR]This game features the main characters from the comic books respectively titled 'The Punisher' (First appearance : Amazing Spider-Man 129, 1973) and 'Nick Fury' (First appearance : Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos 1, 1963), Agent of SHIELD, both published by Marvel Comics. The acronym SHIELD stands for 'Surpreme Headquarters International Espionage Law-enforcement Division'.[CR]Scully, the first of the boss villains here, is loosely based on a villain named Chester Scully who appeared in issues 22-23 (August and September, 1989) of the Punisher's first ongoing series, which ran from 1987 to 1995. The leaping kicks he uses in the game are an homage to the cover of the 23rd issue where his comic book counterpart is shown attacking the Punisher by kicking at him while jumping.[CR]Bushwacker, the 4th stage boss, is based on the homonymous Marvel's super villain (enemy of Daredevil, The Punisher and Wolverine). Although, there are some aesthetic differences from his appearance in the game and in the original comic: half of his face is horribly scared in the comic, while in the game his face seems in good conditions. Also, his special right arm, altered bionically to function as a gun, is still revealed on his real form on the comic, while in the game he can turn his arms from normal form to guns form, like a type of mutant morph (and this should sound incongruous, because he's a mutant's hunter on the Marvel's comics). He appear on the Capcom's game before he was hired by Kingpin for kill Punisher in the original Punisher comic series, so his presence fit perfectly in the game's plot.[CR]Jigsaw, the non-boss enemy appearing in the 2nd area of the final stage (elevator's top) is one of the most dangerous enemies of Punisher in the original comic series. Although, is showed different in the game - in the game he appears like a commando-mercenary, while in the comic he was a former killer of a notorious mobster family of New York. - By the way, his scared face (caused by the same Punisher in the comics) is identical to his original appearance on the comics.[CR]Bruno Costa, the bald gangster with sunglasses appearing in the scenes of attract mode and during the first stages of the game, is also showed in the comic, and he's the responsible of the massacre of the Frank's Castle family, like the game says. However, Punisher killed him in the comic's series, while in the game he's killed by Guardroid (the 2nd stage boss).[CR]Hidden Bonus Level : Looking in the game source code, there's a hidden second bonus game in stage directory. It shows an airplane hijacking or something and two of the generic game thugs burst through the winshield. They run across the screen to the left and then punisher shows up. There are several stewardesses on the floor as hostages and when you go over to them they get freed. But then the stage like instantly is interrupted and randomly takes you to the score screen after every stage and says 'Stage 7 complete' and then switches to an alternate credits screen with all the enemies in the game running across and doing random things. It's probably a part of the game not completed and not remove from the final product and still present in the source code. The only way to see this hidden stage is to browse the source code or using a cheat with emulator like MAME.[CR]Soundtrack releases :[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron - Tenchi wo Kurau II The Battle of Red Wall : G.S.M. Capcom 7 - PCCB-00133 - August 20, 1993.[CR]An unofficial Chinese version is known as "Biaofeng Zhanjing".[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Super Kick : Down, Up+Attack[CR]* Super Air Kick : Forward(x2), Jump, Down+Attack[CR]* Special Ending : finish the game without having to continue to see a different credit sequence (badguy parade).[CR]* On 2nd area of first stage, the enemy Cool will appear for few seconds from a open door, then he will flee : if you're fast, you can kill him before he disappear with the handgun that the players draw automatically in that moment.[CR]* When you're in the 2nd area of stage 2, the gangsters' mansion in Florida, there are 3 jail cells in which 3 girls are being held hostage. Break open the cells and then stand still. The girls will give the players thank-you hugs that restore energy to their lifebars.[CR]* At the end of the 2nd stage you'll fight against the Guardroid. At the end of the room where the battle is set, you'll found an huge bed and a painting in the wall. Destroy this objects for obtain extra weapons and energy that could help you during the fight[CR]* In the 3rd stage (the harbor) you'll encounter several cars, where gangster carrying machine gun will exit from there for attack the players. If you destroy those cars before they'll exit from there, they'll disappear in the explosion: also, you can see the poor driver carbonized after the car's explosion![CR]* The Punisher and Nick Fury's personal handguns are usually drawn automatically whenever enemies carrying firearms - and also the robots called 'Pretty Boy' - turn up. With the exception of the robots, which are tougher to deal with, try to refrain from killing the enemies armed with guns until after you've killed some of those who aren't carrying guns. This certainly comes in useful during the showdown at the end with the Kingpin, who's drawn much larger here than he was in Sega's own "Spider-Man - The Videogame", made 2 years earlier.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Game Designers : Akira Yasuda (Akiman), Maeda, Buchi, Jun Keiba, Junichi Ohno (Ohn)[CR]Program Designers : Kazuhito Nakai, Tomohiro Ueno, Y.

				<title_clean>Street Fighter II': Champion Edition</title_clean>
				<plot>Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition (c) 1992 Capcom.[CR]The Champion Edition was the first official sequel to "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior". [CR]New gameplay additions included the ability to play as any of the four boss characters (increasing the playable roster to twelve) and the option for both players to use the same characters in two-player fights - with an alternate color scheme introduced to distinguish them from each other. Some minor gameplay revisions were also made to balance the characters out. [CR]Additionally, while in the original SFII, one-player games could last up to ten rounds in the event of there being no clear winner (at which point the game made the player lose by default), in the Champion Edition this was reduced to just four rounds.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System" hardware.[CR]B-Board #: 91634B-2[CR]# of Players: Up to 2 simultaneously.[CR]Control : 8-way joystick [CR]Buttons : 6 [CR]=&gt; [1] LP (Jab), [2] MP (Strong), [3] HP (Fierce) [CR]=&gt; [4] LK (Short), [5] MK (Forward), [6] HK (Roundhouse)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition was released in March 1992 in the Japanese arcades. It was known there as the 21st video game made for this system.[CR]Known export release: "Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition [B-Board 91635B-2]".[CR]In Japan, the apostrophe-like character on the game's official logo is actually a prime symbol and thus the official title is pronounced Street Fighter II Dash - Champion Edition.[CR]This game is an enhanced version of "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" : [CR]* Added an alternate color scheme for each character and the ability to select boss characters (Balrog, Vega, Sagat, M. Bison). [CR]* Each stage had different background colors from the original (mainly time of day changes), here are the background changes : [CR]1) Ryu stage : now has midnight blue sky instead of red-orange, and has yellow moon.[CR]2) E. Honda stage : the walls are now yellow, the big picture (excluding the sun) is now blue-purple. The 'Victory' sign is now red-orange. The Hiragana Yu on the left is now red.[CR]3) Blanka stage : the snake is now red, and the houses are now wood color.[CR]4) Guile stage : The sky is now sunset. The tinted canopy on the jet is now purple. The symbol on the ground is now red, and the missile linings are now red.[CR]5) Ken stage : The boat is now blue. The 2 guys on top are now wearing brown clothes and orange clothes. The guy in the trenchcoat and hat is now yellow.[CR]6) Chun Li stage : The 2 customers now wear pink, the meat store's roof is now orange and its sign is now green, the meats on the ceiling are now brown, the "Shanghai Friend Corridor" sign is now pale green with red letters, and the ground is now a darker color.[CR]7) Zangief stage : The floor is now gold and to the left is now copper. The "Attention" flyers are now red with yellow letters.[CR]8) Dhalsim stage : The stage now has blue curtains, silver stone floor, and blue carpet.[CR]9) Balrog ([JP] M. Bison) stage : The floor is now purple. [CR]10) Vega ([JP] Balrog) stage : The stage now sports a dark blue hue, and the Flamenco dancers are now dressed in pink.[CR]11) Sagat stage : Buddhist statue is now gold, and the grass is now a darker green.[CR]12) M. Bison ([JP] Vega) stage : The sky is evening this time.[CR]* New moves were added for some characters. [CR]* The portraits of Chun Li and M. Bison have been recolored. [CR]* Overall hit damage was reduced (favoring combos attacks instead of special moves). [CR]* Special moves were tweaked a bit (i.e. : the fighting styles of Ryu and Ken were distinguishable from one another) [CR]* The main title screen was changed from black to blue. [CR]* Various cosmetic enhancements were made to each character's physical appearance. [CR]* Ryu's original SFII stage featured breakable 'Fuurinkazan' signs. These signs have been removed in this game and are not seen again until "Hyper Street Fighter II - The Anniversary Edition". [CR]* In Ken's original SFII stage, there were two barrels and a stack of boxes which were a single breakable item. From "Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition" to "Super Street Fighter II Turbo" ("Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge" in Japan), there is just a single barrel in Ken's stage. The two barrels and stack of boxes from the original SFII would later return in "Hyper Street Fighter II - The Anniversary Edition". [CR]* Sagat's stage in the original SFII had a palm tree in the foreground. The palm tree is gone in this game and does not return.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Revision 1:[CR]* Build date: 920322[CR]Revision 2:[CR]* Build date: 920513[CR]Revision 3:[CR]* Build date: 920803[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Characters stats: If you enter the classic Konami code Up(x2), Down(x2), Left, Right, Left, Right, MP, LP on the 2nd player side during the demo fight in attract mode, it makes a bunch of zeros appear.

				<plot>Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition (c) 1992 Capcom.[CR]The Champion Edition was the first official sequel to "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior". [CR]New gameplay additions included the ability to play as any of the four boss characters (increasing the playable roster to twelve) and the option for both players to use the same characters in two-player fights - with an alternate color scheme introduced to distinguish them from each other. Some minor gameplay revisions were also made to balance the characters out. [CR]Additionally, while in the original SFII, one-player games could last up to ten rounds in the event of there being no clear winner (at which point the game made the player lose by default), in the Champion Edition this was reduced to just four rounds.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System" hardware.[CR]B-Board #: 91634B-2[CR]# of Players: Up to 2 simultaneously.[CR]Control : 8-way joystick [CR]Buttons : 6 [CR]=&gt; [1] LP (Jab), [2] MP (Strong), [3] HP (Fierce) [CR]=&gt; [4] LK (Short), [5] MK (Forward), [6] HK (Roundhouse)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition was released in March 1992 in the Japanese arcades. It was known there as the 21st video game made for this system.[CR]Known export release: "Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition [B-Board 91635B-2]".[CR]In Japan, the apostrophe-like character on the game's official logo is actually a prime symbol and thus the official title is pronounced Street Fighter II Dash - Champion Edition.[CR]This game is an enhanced version of "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" : [CR]* Added an alternate color scheme for each character and the ability to select boss characters (Balrog, Vega, Sagat, M. Bison). [CR]* Each stage had different background colors from the original (mainly time of day changes), here are the background changes : [CR]1) Ryu stage : now has midnight blue sky instead of red-orange, and has yellow moon.[CR]2) E. Honda stage : the walls are now yellow, the big picture (excluding the sun) is now blue-purple. The 'Victory' sign is now red-orange. The Hiragana Yu on the left is now red.[CR]3) Blanka stage : the snake is now red, and the houses are now wood color.[CR]4) Guile stage : The sky is now sunset. The tinted canopy on the jet is now purple. The symbol on the ground is now red, and the missile linings are now red.[CR]5) Ken stage : The boat is now blue. The 2 guys on top are now wearing brown clothes and orange clothes. The guy in the trenchcoat and hat is now yellow.[CR]6) Chun Li stage : The 2 customers now wear pink, the meat store's roof is now orange and its sign is now green, the meats on the ceiling are now brown, the "Shanghai Friend Corridor" sign is now pale green with red letters, and the ground is now a darker color.[CR]7) Zangief stage : The floor is now gold and to the left is now copper. The "Attention" flyers are now red with yellow letters.[CR]8) Dhalsim stage : The stage now has blue curtains, silver stone floor, and blue carpet.[CR]9) Balrog ([JP] M. Bison) stage : The floor is now purple. [CR]10) Vega ([JP] Balrog) stage : The stage now sports a dark blue hue, and the Flamenco dancers are now dressed in pink.[CR]11) Sagat stage : Buddhist statue is now gold, and the grass is now a darker green.[CR]12) M. Bison ([JP] Vega) stage : The sky is evening this time.[CR]* New moves were added for some characters. [CR]* The portraits of Chun Li and M. Bison have been recolored. [CR]* Overall hit damage was reduced (favoring combos attacks instead of special moves). [CR]* Special moves were tweaked a bit (i.e. : the fighting styles of Ryu and Ken were distinguishable from one another) [CR]* The main title screen was changed from black to blue. [CR]* Various cosmetic enhancements were made to each character's physical appearance. [CR]* Ryu's original SFII stage featured breakable 'Fuurinkazan' signs. These signs have been removed in this game and are not seen again until "Hyper Street Fighter II - The Anniversary Edition". [CR]* In Ken's original SFII stage, there were two barrels and a stack of boxes which were a single breakable item. From "Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition" to "Super Street Fighter II Turbo" ("Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge" in Japan), there is just a single barrel in Ken's stage. The two barrels and stack of boxes from the original SFII would later return in "Hyper Street Fighter II - The Anniversary Edition". [CR]* Sagat's stage in the original SFII had a palm tree in the foreground. The palm tree is gone in this game and does not return.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Revision 1:[CR]* Build date: 920322[CR]Revision 2:[CR]* Build date: 920513[CR]Revision 3:[CR]* Build date: 920803[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Characters stats: If you enter the classic Konami code Up(x2), Down(x2), Left, Right, Left, Right, MP, LP on the 2nd player side during the demo fight in attract mode, it makes a bunch of zeros appear.

				<plot>Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition (c) 1992 Capcom.[CR]The Champion Edition was the first official sequel to "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior". [CR]New gameplay additions included the ability to play as any of the four boss characters (increasing the playable roster to twelve) and the option for both players to use the same characters in two-player fights - with an alternate color scheme introduced to distinguish them from each other. Some minor gameplay revisions were also made to balance the characters out. [CR]Additionally, while in the original SFII, one-player games could last up to ten rounds in the event of there being no clear winner (at which point the game made the player lose by default), in the Champion Edition this was reduced to just four rounds.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System" hardware.[CR]B-Board #: 91634B-2[CR]# of Players: Up to 2 simultaneously.[CR]Control : 8-way joystick [CR]Buttons : 6 [CR]=&gt; [1] LP (Jab), [2] MP (Strong), [3] HP (Fierce) [CR]=&gt; [4] LK (Short), [5] MK (Forward), [6] HK (Roundhouse)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition was released in March 1992 in the Japanese arcades. It was known there as the 21st video game made for this system.[CR]Known export release: "Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition [B-Board 91635B-2]".[CR]In Japan, the apostrophe-like character on the game's official logo is actually a prime symbol and thus the official title is pronounced Street Fighter II Dash - Champion Edition.[CR]This game is an enhanced version of "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" : [CR]* Added an alternate color scheme for each character and the ability to select boss characters (Balrog, Vega, Sagat, M. Bison). [CR]* Each stage had different background colors from the original (mainly time of day changes), here are the background changes : [CR]1) Ryu stage : now has midnight blue sky instead of red-orange, and has yellow moon.[CR]2) E. Honda stage : the walls are now yellow, the big picture (excluding the sun) is now blue-purple. The 'Victory' sign is now red-orange. The Hiragana Yu on the left is now red.[CR]3) Blanka stage : the snake is now red, and the houses are now wood color.[CR]4) Guile stage : The sky is now sunset. The tinted canopy on the jet is now purple. The symbol on the ground is now red, and the missile linings are now red.[CR]5) Ken stage : The boat is now blue. The 2 guys on top are now wearing brown clothes and orange clothes. The guy in the trenchcoat and hat is now yellow.[CR]6) Chun Li stage : The 2 customers now wear pink, the meat store's roof is now orange and its sign is now green, the meats on the ceiling are now brown, the "Shanghai Friend Corridor" sign is now pale green with red letters, and the ground is now a darker color.[CR]7) Zangief stage : The floor is now gold and to the left is now copper. The "Attention" flyers are now red with yellow letters.[CR]8) Dhalsim stage : The stage now has blue curtains, silver stone floor, and blue carpet.[CR]9) Balrog ([JP] M. Bison) stage : The floor is now purple. [CR]10) Vega ([JP] Balrog) stage : The stage now sports a dark blue hue, and the Flamenco dancers are now dressed in pink.[CR]11) Sagat stage : Buddhist statue is now gold, and the grass is now a darker green.[CR]12) M. Bison ([JP] Vega) stage : The sky is evening this time.[CR]* New moves were added for some characters. [CR]* The portraits of Chun Li and M. Bison have been recolored. [CR]* Overall hit damage was reduced (favoring combos attacks instead of special moves). [CR]* Special moves were tweaked a bit (i.e. : the fighting styles of Ryu and Ken were distinguishable from one another) [CR]* The main title screen was changed from black to blue. [CR]* Various cosmetic enhancements were made to each character's physical appearance. [CR]* Ryu's original SFII stage featured breakable 'Fuurinkazan' signs. These signs have been removed in this game and are not seen again until "Hyper Street Fighter II - The Anniversary Edition". [CR]* In Ken's original SFII stage, there were two barrels and a stack of boxes which were a single breakable item. From "Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition" to "Super Street Fighter II Turbo" ("Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge" in Japan), there is just a single barrel in Ken's stage. The two barrels and stack of boxes from the original SFII would later return in "Hyper Street Fighter II - The Anniversary Edition". [CR]* Sagat's stage in the original SFII had a palm tree in the foreground. The palm tree is gone in this game and does not return.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Revision 1:[CR]* Build date: 920322[CR]Revision 2:[CR]* Build date: 920513[CR]Revision 3:[CR]* Build date: 920803[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Characters stats: If you enter the classic Konami code Up(x2), Down(x2), Left, Right, Left, Right, MP, LP on the 2nd player side during the demo fight in attract mode, it makes a bunch of zeros appear.

				<plot>Street Fighter II' Turbo - Hyper Fighting (c) 1992 Capcom.[CR]This is the second SFII follow-up. Here's what's new: [CR]* Gameplay is SIGNIFICANTLY sped up to intensify the pace of the game. [CR]* More special moves (ie. Chun Li's fireball, Dhalsim's Yoga Teleport) are added for each character except for M. Bison. [CR]* New color schemes are added for each character (but the color schemes for the stage backgrounds are still the same as they were for Champion Edition). [CR]* The addition of mid-air special moves for Chun Li, Ryu and Ken are introduced. [CR]* Platform graphics (resembling the medal ceremonies in the Olympics) are added to each character's ending, featuring the character you completed the game with at the first-place platform, M. Bison at the second-place platform, and Sagat at the third-place platform. The musical setting for this display is the music from the home stage of the character standing on the 1st-place platform (If you completed the game with Sagat or M. Bison, the one you used stands on the 1st-place platform, the other one on the 2nd-place platform, and Vega occupies the 3rd-place platform).[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System" hardware.[CR]B-Board #: 91634B-2[CR]Players: Up to 2 simultaneously.[CR]Control per player: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons per player: 6[CR]= &gt; [1] LP (Jab), [2] MP (Strong), [3] HP (Fierce) [CR]= &gt; [4] LK (Short), [5] MK (Forward), [6] HK (Roundhouse)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Street Fighter II' Turbo - Hyper Fighting was released in December 1992 in the Japanese arcades. It was known there as the 24th video game made for this system.[CR]Exported as "Street Fighter II' - Hyper Fighting [B-Board 91635B-2]".[CR]This ROM upgrade to "Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition" was an idea by Capcom USA employee James Goddard in response to the rampant unauthorized hacks that arcade operators were installing in their SFII'CE machine to make the game play faster, have mid-air special moves, change characters on-the-fly, and all sorts of other strange things. The hacks made the game interesting again to those who wanted something new in the game, but destroyed the balance of the game. [CR]The 'Hyper Fighting' upgrade was an attempt to incorporate many of the ideas present in the hacks while maintaining game balance. The way those ideas were implemented were taken from "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers", which was still being developed at the time and was planned to be the direct successor to SFII'CE before all the unauthorized hacks forced this upgrade to be made. Ironically, this unforeseen upgrade is considered the best and most balanced game in the SFII series.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]Special Ending : finish the game on one quarter to see additional credit sequence.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Street Fighter II - The World Warrior (c) 1991 Capcom.[CR]Street Fighter II - The World Warrior is the legendary fighting game that defined the fighting game genre. One or two players can choose from eight selectable World Warriors and must defeat the other seven, before finally taking on four non-selectable 'boss' characters. [CR]Each fighter is as distinctive in feel and fighting style as they are in physical appearance, with each protagonist possessing several fantastical 'special moves' (the first genuine example of such in the fighting genre) to accompany the usual array of kicks, punches and throws. These special moves, while being difficult to execute due to the complexity of the joystick and buttons combinations required, allows the fighter to inflict huge amounts of damage on their opponent. [CR]Street Fighter II is a fighting game in the truest sense of the word, with deceptively deep and strategic gameplay ensuring that experienced players would destroy simple 'button mashers' with relative ease.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System" hardware.[CR]B-Board # 90629B[CR]Players: Up to 2.[CR]Control: 8-way joystick  per player.[CR]Buttons: 6 per player.[CR]= &gt; [1] LP (Jab), [2] MP (Strong), [3] HP (Fierce) [CR]= &gt; [4] LK (Short), [5] MK (Forward), [6] HK (Roundhouse)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Street Fighter II was released in February 1991 in the Japanese arcades. It was known as the 14th video game made for the CP System.[CR]Known re-releases:[CR]"Street Fighter II - The World Warrior [B-Board 90629B-2]"[CR]"Street Fighter II - The World Warrior [B-Board 90629B-3]"[CR]SFII was the fighting game that changed the face of video-games forever. So innovative was the game, that many of the game-play elements that fighting fans now take for granted, appeared HERE first. Within just weeks of release, its place in gaming history was assured. Any fighting game that has appeared after SFII is influenced - to a greater or lesser degree - by the Capcom legend. [CR]During the development of SFII (and before the release of Final Fight), the very first free-hand drawing was done in the fall of 1988. At this time, eight prototype characters and an Island design was drawn. Just like the world map of the final version, the island would scroll on-screen to show the next destination, culminating at the top of the island. [CR]* With the rapid success of SFII, it was rumored that Mattel, the makers of Barbie, sued Capcom for using the name Ken - insisting that people would confuse the Street Fighter character with that of Barbie's boyfriend. To avoid further litigation Capcom gave Ken a surname. [CR]* Fans of Street Fighter are well accustomed to the story of 'Sheng Long'. SFII was already very popular in the arcades when the April issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) came out. The story relates to a supposed secret character in SFII; his name was Sheng Long, the 'master' of Ryu and Ken. To reach him, according to EGM, the player had to survive a number of matches against M. Bison WITHOUT actually touching him. Should you achieve this, Sheng Long would apparently appear and kill Bison, and the player would then fight him instead. His style was essentially a mix of Ryu's and Ken's styles, but was much faster and inflicted far greater damage. When the EGM issue came out, thousands of gamers spent hours pouring money into SFII machines, trying to get to this non-existent character. Capcom had neither confirmed nor denied the Sheng Long story - obviously spotting the increase in revenue the mythical character could generate - and it was only much later that EGM themselves admitted that it was just an April Fools' joke. [CR]* There were only ever THREE official Capcom versions of SFII, at least until the switch to the CPS2 system was made. The first was "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"; more commonly referred to as 'Street Fighter II'. The second was "Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition" (also known in Japan as "Street Fighter II Dash" because the Japanese refer to the apostrophe after the 'II' as a 'dash') and many operators from that era will probably relate to the problems that its release caused. Capcom originally made 'Champion Edition' available only in dedicated form - insisting that only a limited number of these dedicated units would be manufactured - and the game would never be produced in kit form. After everyone who could afford the machines had invested in the expensive dedicated units, Capcom, somewhat inevitably, began producing the game in kit form, claiming that they never knew how much demand there would be for the game. After the earnings from 'Champion Edition' began to subside, the infamous 'grey market' enhancements began to appear. Many of these went by names like 'Turbo', 'Hyper', and 'Super', including the 'Rainbow Edition' and 'Accelerator T1'. In early 1993, Capcom sued these manufacturers for copyright infringement and thus put an end to the development and distribution of these unauthorized enhancement kits. Capcom then released "Street Fighter II' - Hyper Fighting" (known as "Street Fighter II' Turbo - Hyper Fighting" in Japan), as the 'official' "Champion Edition" upgrade. This, just like the grey market kits, was a simple ROM upgrade to the "Champion Edition" board. Later on, Capcom developed the CPS2 (A/B) system that featured "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers" and its sequel "Super Street Fighter II Turbo" (known as "Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge" in Japan), the final 'Street Fighter II' game until the 2003 release of "Hyper Street Fighter II - The Anniversary Edition". [CR]* Each stage has background colors that would change in later versions of the game (mainly time of day changes), here are the original color schemes for each stage background :[CR]1) Ryu stage : The stage has red-orange sky and a yellow moon.[CR]2) E. Honda stage : The walls are dark blue; the floor is royal blue. The big picture (excluding the sun) is black. The 'Victory' sign is blue. The Hiragana Yu on the left is purple.[CR]3) Blanka stage : The snake is green, and the wooden houses are in brighter colors than in "Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition".[CR]4) Guile stage : The sky is daylight. There is teal tinted canopy on the jet. The symbol on the ground is blue. The missile linings are yellow. The people in the background wear green, but that doesn't change until "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers".[CR]5) Ken stage : The boat is red; the 2 guys on top are wearing brown clothes and purple clothes. On the bottom are the bald man in grey shirt, a man in white bowler and white coat, a woman in pink dress, and a guy in the cyan shirt and brown pants. The guy in the trenchcoat and hat is blue.[CR]6) Chun Li stage : The 2 customers wear blue, the meat store's roof is light blue and its sign is red, the meats hanging on the ceiling are pink, the man holding the chicken wears green, the "Shanghai Friend Corridor" is light blue with red letters, the water sign is green, and the ground is a bright beige.[CR]7) Zangief stage : The floor is silver, and the area to the left is red. The 'Attention' flyers are tan with brown letters.[CR]8) Dhalsim stage : The stage has red curtains, a teal stone floor, and a red carpet.[CR]9) Balrog ([JP] M. Bison) stage : The stage floor is blue. The guy throwing confetti at win/lose wears orange, the car to the left is navy blue, and the car to the right is black.[CR]10) Vega ([JP] Balrog) stage : The stage and floor are orange, and the Flamenco dancers are dressed in yellow.[CR]11) Sagat stage : The Buddhist statue is silver, and the grass is a lighter shade of green than in later versions of the game.[CR]12) M. Bison ([JP] Vega) stage : the sky is daylight. The palace roof is pale red, and the bell is olive-green with red trim.[CR]* Mike the Bison : many have conjectured whether Mike from the original "Street Fighter" is the same as Balrog ('Mike Bison' in Japan) from SFII. While Capcom of Japan confirms this, Capcom of America strenuously denied it (mainly due to the possibility of Mike Tyson filing a lawsuit). In Japan, as long as the name is changed, it's far easier to basically rip off someone else's character and have it treated as an original creation (in America it would be some form of copyright/identity theft). Ironically, as a result of the name change, Vega is a better fitting name for the Spanish warrior. (Vega is known as 'Balrog' in Japan. The name Balrog has its roots in Nordic mythology, while Vega is a Hispanic name.)[CR]The E in E. Honda's name stands for his first name, Edmund; the M in M. Bison's name stands for 'Major'.[CR]* About Chun Li : Chun Li is notable for being one of the first successful and popular female video game protagonists. When SFII was released, most female characters in games existed as objectives to be rescued or cast in the roles of other supporting characters, such as townspeople, girlfriends, the occasional opponent, or simply background decoration. Beyond RPGs, there were very few female heroes in action-based video games. After the success of SFII and Chun Li's popularity, female protagonists became more and more common. Since then, in games with selectable characters, at least, there will generally always be one or two selectable female characters. [CR]* About M. Bison ('Vega' in Japan) : His design shares more than one detail with Kato, a character of the anime 'Doomed Megalopolis'. Like Kato, M. Bison is tall and thin, wears a red military uniform, keep wind his body with a black mantle when he's not fighting and possesses some obscure evil powers: even the star impressed on his hat (until Super Street Fighter II) is similar to the design of Kato.[CR]The cabinet and the main characters Ryu, Ken, Zangief Chun Li, Cammy, Blanka and M. Bison, make an appearance on the 2012 animation movie 'Wreck-It Ralph' from Walt Disney Animation Studios.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Here is the list of all versions : [CR]910206 [CR]* US release. [CR]910214 [CR]* WORLD, US and JAPAN releases. [CR]910228 [CR]* WORLD and US releases. [CR]910306 [CR]* US and JAPAN releases. [CR]910318 [CR]* WORLD and US releases. [CR]910411 [CR]* US and JAPAN releases.[CR]910522 [CR]* WORLD, US and JAPAN releases.[CR]911101 [CR]* US release.[CR]911210 [CR]* JAPAN release. [CR]920312[CR]* JAPAN release.[CR]ADDITIONAL NOTES : [CR]US versions have the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.[CR]In the Japanese versions : [CR]* Balrog is named 'M. Bison' (in this case, the M stands for 'Mike', see Trivia section above for further details). [CR]* Vega is named 'Balrog'. [CR]* M. Bison is named 'Vega'. [CR]* Guile's deceased friend Charlie is named 'Nash'. [CR]* Guile's wife Jane is named 'Julia'. [CR]* Guile's daughter Amy is named 'Chris', however there is no mention of her name anywhere in Guile's Japanese ending. [CR]None of the endings are translated 100% accurately from Japanese to English, but most are pretty close : [CR]* Blanka's ending : In the non-Japanese versions, Blanka's mother says that he was lost when his plane crashed in Brazil when he was a baby. [CR]In the Japanese versions there is no explanation of how, when, or where mother and son were separated. [CR]Since the anklets she gave to Jimmy BEFORE they were separated still fit him, he was probably not supposed to be a baby when he was lost. [CR]* Chun Li's ending : Chun Li refers to M. Bison's organization as 'Bison's drug'. This was probably supposed to be 'drug ring', as the word 'ring' was added in later versions of the game. [CR]In the Japanese versions, she calls it 'the organization of evil'; there is no mention of drugs. [CR]* Dhalsim's ending : In the Japanese versions, Dhalsim says that the photograph is of him a long time ago. [CR]In the non-Japanese versions, he says it is him 'in his past life'. [CR]Since only three years had passed, he obviously didn't actually mean that he had died and been reincarnated since the photograph had been taken. [CR]* Guile's ending : In the non-Japanese versions, Guile asks M. Bison if he remembers : him (Guile), him and Charlie and Cambodia. Bison says he remembers and that Guile was not the runt he was then. [CR]None of this is said in the Japanese versions. [CR]In the non-Japanese versions, after his wife Jane stops Guile from killing Bison, she says that killing him won't bring Charlie back, only make Guile a murderer, just like Bison. [CR]In the Japanese versions, 'Julia' only says that killing 'Vega' won't bring 'Nash' back. She does not say that it would make Guile a murderer.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Characters stats : If you enter the classic Konami code UP(x2), DOWN(x2), LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, MP, LP on the Player-2 side during the demo fight in attract mode, it makes a bunch of zeros appear. [CR]First line contains 0001 0002 0003 0004 [CR]Second line contains 0005 0006 0007 0008 0009 0010 0011 0012 [CR]0001 = No idea, probably some sort of 'experience points' for 1P side. [CR]0002 = The no. of coins put in in the left-hand slot. [CR]0003 = Same as 0001, but for 2nd player. [CR]0004 = Same as 0002, but for right-hand slot. [CR]0005 = No. of times Ryu has been used. [CR]0006 = No. of times Honda has been used. [CR]0007 = No. of times Blanka has been used [CR]0008 = No. of times Guile has been used. [CR]0009 = No. of times Ken has been used. [CR]0010 = No. of times Chun Li has been used. [CR]0011 = No. of times Zangief has been used. [CR]0012 = No. of times Dhalsim has been used. [CR]* Special Ending : Finish the game on 1 credit to see an additional credit sequence. [CR]* To get Ryu vs. Ryu : Start a fresh game on the left side (1P). Select any character other than Ryu. Play the game until you reach Ryu. Lose. Join in the game on the other side and hit 2P BEFORE the timer runs out. Select Ryu and enjoy fighting Ryu. [CR]* Guile Freeze Himself (aka 'Pose' and 'Statue') : Get close enough to your opponent to do an upside down kick. Charge back on the joystick. After charging back, press roundhouse to execute the upside down kick, while continuing to charge back. As soon as Guile kicks and starts to flip around to land on the ground, throw a Sonic Boom with fierce (this is why we have been charging back). Guile will freeze standing up on one leg (which is one of the frames of Guile's landing after the upside down kick). [CR]Un-freeze : You can 'un-freeze' at any time, even after the round ends (that makes it a good pause). To do so, execute a Flash Kick (charge down for 2 seconds then press up and any kick). [CR]* Guile's Handcuffs (aka 'Freeze the Enemy') : Though its not required, its easiest to do this move when the enemy is dizzy. Charge down for 2 seconds. Then press UP (as if you were doing a Flash Kick) and hit the Strong and Forward buttons, while trying to hit strong a split second before hitting forward. Basically what you are doing is throwing your opponent with strong, and while in middle of the throw, you do a Flash Kick. When this move is done, you see all of the frames of Guile's Strong throw, however instead of flying across the screen at the end of the throw, the enemy sticks to you. [CR]Un-handcuff : The 'un-handcuff' is the difficult part because it requires doing Guile's Shadow Throw. Charge back for 3 seconds then hit forward on the joystick along with the Fierce and Roundhouse buttons. Just like in the Handcuffs, you should try to hit the Roundhouse button slightly before the Fierce button. Also, you should hit the buttons slightly after moving the joystick forward. You can practice this by throwing Sonic Booms and seeing how far forward you can walk and still throw the sonic boom. [CR]* Guile Invisible Throw (aka 'Shadow Throw', 'Magic Throw', 'Phantom Throw') : Charge back then hit forward on the joystick along with the Fierce and Roundhouse buttons. Just like in the Handcuffs, you should try to hit the Roundhouse button slightly before the Fierce button. Also, you should hit the buttons slightly after moving the joystick forward. You can practice this by throwing sonic booms and seeing how far forward you can walk and still throw the sonic boom. [CR]* Guile Reset the Machine (aka 'Blackout') : Do a throw with Strong. Then do a Flash Kick before the opponent hits the ground. You can also try doing this by doing a Flash Kick with Fierce and Roundhouse. [CR]* Dhalsim Invisible glitch : Throw a Yoga Fire (down, down-forward, forward) with both the Fierce and Forward buttons. This only works on versions 3 and 4 of the SFII boards. [CR]* Blanka Double Roll Bite (Blanka rolls slow, then fast then bites without landing) : Do a slow roll (with Jab). While rolling, charge for a second roll. Roll with Fierce before Blanka lands. While in the second roll, push the joystick forward and hit Fierce to bite. [CR]* Ken or Ryu Get Stuck on the car and bounce : Start the car bonus round. Break the left (or right) side of the car until it blocks. Face away from the car. Do a jump toward the car. Kick right after you jump but not at the same time as you jump. If you are lucky, you will be facing backwards. This is a tough one, so have patience. [CR]* Ken or Ryu Endless Hurricane Kick : Do a normal Hurricane kick then tap Roundhouse extremely fast (fast enough to do Honda's Hundred Hand Slap, Chun Li's Lightning Leg, or Blanka's Electricity) while Ken or Ryu is in the air. [CR]* Zangief Turbo Short : This is another glitch that is fun only to do once. If you hit your opponent with low Short, do another low Short, then hit Jab as fast as possible. If a 3rd low Short would have hit the opponent a Short will come out even though you are hitting Jab. If the short would have missed, Jab usually comes out even though short will from time to time.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Street Fighter (1987)[CR]2.

There are some special features in this program. First, the game has increased speed. Midair moves are also possible, just execute your favorite attack in the air. All fireballs (except Yoga Flame) are homing, meaning that they move toward the opponent, even when they jump. All jab fireballs are extremely slow. Strong fireballs are medium speed. Fierce fireballs are lightning fast, hitting instantaneously. You also have the ability to do multiple fireballs. In other words, you can throw a new fireball before the old one hits. You can climb the screen indefinitely, (jump, do a special move, jump, do a special move, etc.). Also, throws have seemingly unlimited vertical range.[CR]The best part of this game is the ability to switch characters in the middle of a round. This is done by pressing START on the player controller that you are.  Starting with Ryu, the cycle is as follows : Ryu -&gt; E.

				<plot>&#12473;&#12488;&#12521;&#12452;&#12480;&#12540;&#39131;&#31452; (c) 1989 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR](Strider Hiryu)[CR]Strider Hiryu is a multi-directional scrolling platform beat-em-up in which the player takes control of 'Strider Hiryu', a ninja-style warrior who must defeat a legendary being known as 'Grandmaster Meio'. [CR]Set in a dystopian future in the year 2048, Meio has been watching Earth from his own distant galaxy and has created a space station (known as 'The Third Moon') between Earth and its moon in order to rule over the Human race. [CR]Armed with a curved sword known as a 'Falchion', Strider must travel the globe to find and destroy Meio. Numerous power-ups can be obtained from metallic item boxes carried by certain enemies. These include an extension to Hiryu's attack range that lasts for one hundred slashes, two types of health aids (represented by the kanji used to write Hiryu's name), a max health extension, an extra life and a power-up that not only makes Hiryu invulnerable to attack, but also increases his own attack abilities via shadow images of himself for 30 seconds. [CR]Hiryu can also summon robotic companions known collectively as "options" that help him fight enemies. These consist of up to two mushroom-like droids, a saber-toothed tiger and a hawk. These are referred to as Options A, B and C respectively. [CR]Strider Hiryu is highly agile and has the ability to latch onto walls and ceilings using a metallic hook; a concept which set the game apart from other platformers and allowed for highly inventive level design. [CR]The game consists of five stages: [CR]* Kazakh Soviet Sot Republic (called "St. Petersburgh" during the arcade game's attract sequence), [CR]* Siberian Wilderness [CR]* Aerial Battleship Ballog [CR]* Amazonian Jungle [CR]* The Third Moon. [CR]Each stage is divided into a number of smaller sections, with each section imposing its own time limit. Strider initially has a three-point health gauge (which can be increased to five points with health extension power-ups) and will lose a life when the health gauge is fully depleted. Lives are also lost by either falling into a bottomless pit, or failing to complete a section within the time limit. [CR]The game ends once all lives are lost, but continues are available.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System" hardware.[CR]B-Board ID: 89625B-2[CR]Players: 2 (alternatively).[CR]Control: 8-way joystick.[CR]Buttons: 2.[CR]=&gt; [1] Slash, [2] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Strider Hiryu was originally released in March 1989 in Japan. It was known there as the third video game made for this system. It is known outside Japan as just "Strider".[CR]The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Flying Dragon Strider'. [CR]Known re-releases: [CR]"Strider Hiryu [B-Board 91634B-2]" (1991) [CR]Known export releases: [CR]"Strider [B-Board 89624B-2]" [CR]"Strider [B-Board 89624B-3]" [CR]Strider became one of Capcom's early hits before "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", revered for its innovative gameplay, multilingual voice clips during cutscenes. [CR]Hiryu did not have his beginnings at the Arcades, but rather at the black and white pages of a manga anthology. The original Strider Hiryu manga was serialized between May and October 1988 issues of the Monthly Comp Comics and was illustrated by Tatsumi Wada (an alias of Strider's creator, Moto Kikaku or perhaps the other way around). Capcom was heavily involved in the production of the manga, which led to the creation to the later CPS game. The manga told the story of former Strider, Hiryu, who retired after killing his older sister, Mariya, who went insane for some mysterious reasons. A few years since the incident, Hiryuu is forced out of retirement by Strider director Matic when he tells the news of Kain's capture by enemy forces. The Strider Hiryu arcade game was released shortly after the manga finished it's run, although the game barely has anything to do with the plot of the manga. [CR]As Strider was made before the fall of Communism, one could take this as a 'cold war'-era game. The main plot of the story revolves around the fact that nuclear war had broken out and a Russian secret weapon went on a rampage, the only people being able to stop it are 'Earth's Final Guardians', the Striders. Hiryu is the youngest of the Striders. Kafazu (the setting of Strider) is yet another obfuscated name (think Gotham City and New York, for you Batman fans). It's actually Kazhakstan. If you don't know what that is, it's a country in central Asia. The number of mosques in Kafazu also reflects the fact that Kazhakstan is a mainly muslim population. [CR]Strider Hiryu was resurrected in 1998 as a character in "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes". [CR]One of the three girls at the end of level 2 appears as a striker character (Ton-Pooh) in "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes". [CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Strider Hiryu : G.S.M. Capcom 2 - D25B1001) on May 21, 1989.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]When you complete a level, you get the following bonus points...[CR]1: 5,000 points[CR]2: 8,000 points[CR]3: 10,000 points[CR]4: 10,000 points[CR]5: 30,000 points[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]1 - During the game you can have the maximum of 2 'helpers'. Every time you get a helper, it will use the 'last' slot available of your life meter, or be, if you receive a damage, you will lose this life-slot and will lose your helper.[CR]2 - Try to 'link' your helper(s) in the 'left-side' slots, because you will lose the helpers only if you get a lot of damage. On the 1st stage, be with only 2 life-slots when catching the helpers, it will maintain they more safe.[CR]3 - If you have only 2 life-slots, and both 2 helpers, try to find the 'tiger' icon, but don't catch it. Get damage until you have only 1 life-slot. Now catch the tiger icon. The tiger will help you a few seconds, and it is over you will own the 2 helpers, but it will use only one slot, the left-slot. You will lose it only if you die (time-over not included).[CR]4 - If you lose a life by 'time-over', your stock of 'helpers' will maintain, and it will keep on the same "slot" of the helpers.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Willow (c) 1989 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]Willow is a sideways scrolling platform shoot-em-up game loosely based upon the movie of the same name. Players take on the role of one of two characters: Willow Ufgood or Madmartigan. The hero's mission is to rescue the baby Elora Danan from the evil Queen Bavmorda and bring her back safely. If the quest fails, the Queen will plunge the world into darkness and chaos.[CR]The game consists of 6 levels, each representing a scene from the movie. Defeated enemies drop gold coins that can be collected by the player. In addition, each level is littered with locked treasure chests that can be shot open and the treasure within collected. The gold can be used to purchase a number of weapons and character power-ups from a nearby shop (represented on screen by a wise old man). All power-ups will stay with the player until all lives are lost and the game is over.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System" hardware.[CR]B-Board ID: 88622B-3[CR]Players: Up to 2 simultaneously.[CR]Control: 8-Way Joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 2 per player.[CR]=&gt; [1] Fire/Swing, [2] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Willow was released in June 1989 in the Japanese arcades. It was known there as the 5th video game made for the CP System.[CR]The gagem is licensed by Lucasfilm and based on the movie of the same name.[CR]Known Export releases: "Willow [B-Board 89624B-3]".[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Scoring in this game is relatively hard since there are a lot of things you can get points for. Also, you get money for many of the monsters you kill. This money, though, will only remain around for a couple of seconds so you have to be quick to pick it up. Here is the scoring table :[CR]Archer : 50 Points - 10 Golds[CR]Axe Thrower : 200 Points - 10 Golds[CR]Bat : 200 Points - 10 Golds[CR]Devil Dog : 100 Points - 10 Golds[CR]Eagle : 200 Points - 10 Golds[CR]Fish : 200 Points - 200 Golds[CR]Projectile thrower : 1500 Points - 100 Golds[CR]Snake : 50 Points - 10 Golds[CR]Snowball : 100 Points[CR]Soldier : 50 Points - 100 Golds[CR]Spear Thrower : 500 Points - 100 Golds[CR]Troll : 500 Points - 100 [CR]The Bosses :[CR]Sorcerer : 500 Points - 200 Golds[CR]Devil Dog : 7000 Points - 10000 Golds[CR]Sergeant Claw : 2100 Points - 400 Golds[CR]Wizard : 6500 Points - 10000 Golds[CR]Dragon : 10000 Points - 1000 Golds[CR]Sorsha : 15000 Points - 10000 Golds[CR]Two-headed Dragon : 20000 Points - 10000 Golds[CR]Kael : 10000 Points - 10000 Golds[CR]Bavmorda : 0 Points - 0 Golds[CR]In addition to the above, you can get money or items from the treasure chests. Attacking the chests is enough to open them.[CR]You will receive a bonus at the end of each stage. The bonus comes out to be :[CR]1) Time (in seconds) x 100 x Stage Number[CR]2) Life (in bars) x 100 x Stage Number[CR]I.E. : For Stage 2 you had 1:31 in time left and three bars of life, your bonus would be :[CR]91 seconds x 100 x 2 = 18200 points for Time[CR]3 bars    x 100 x 2 = 600 points for Life[CR]Grand Total Bonus : 18800 points[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* DEBUG MODE: How to activate the debug features...[CR]1) Set "Game Mode" Dip Switch to "Game".[CR]2) Set both "Coin A" and "Coin B" Dip Switches to 1C_1C.[CR]3) Reset the game.[CR]4) Insert a coin.[CR]5) Set "Game Mode" Dip Switch to "Test".[CR]6) Set the debug Dip Switches to what you want.[CR]7) Start a 1 player game.[CR]Some debug features :[CR]- "Starting Level" is effective only when you start a new game (you must NOT continue play !)[CR]- Once you set "Maximum magic/sword power" to "On", setting it to "Off" won't have any effect until you start a new game (you must NOT continue play !)[CR]- "Slow Motion Delay" is effective only when "Slow Motion" is set to "On"[CR]- Even if "Freeze" Dip Switch is set to "On" a message will be displayed to its end.[CR]- I can't tell what kind of infos are displayed when "Display Debug Infos". Dip Switch is sry to "On" :(Any hint about them are welcome ![CR]- Both "Coin A" and "Coin B" Dip Switches must be set to "2 Coins/1 Credit" to make this mode available. If only one Dip Switch is set to it, it is the same as 2C_1C.[CR]- When the "Stage Magic Continue" Dip Switch is set to "On", your magic and sword power will be increased at the end of the level if you haven't bought the magic/sword item. But you won't notice this before you use the character again. For example, magic power will be increased at the end of level 1 but you won't notice it before level 3, and sword power will be increased at the end of level 2 but you won't notice it before level 4.[CR]* The Bosses : There are nine bosses to deal with in this game. Watch the Boss Vitality meter to see how much damage you are doing to them. As you damage them, they will lose a bar off the meter.[CR]SORCERER (Vitality unknown) :[CR]1) First, get off the bridge and onto the cliff. This will make the battle easier to fight.[CR]2) Basically, just keep firing in his direction and jump to attack when needed. When he attacks, just jump over his spells.[CR]3) This will take a while but keep pounding on him and you will send him back to school.[CR]DEVIL DOG (Vitality : 4) : At the end of Stage I, a sorcerer appears telling you to turn back. To prove[CR]his point, he magically makes a regular Devil Dog grow to huge proportions.[CR]1) The main attacks the dog makes are its flame breath and claws. You must keep mobile at all times to avoid the effects of these.[CR]2) When the dog crouches, it is read to release a hot-breath torrent. This is the time to jump up and make your shots count. The pooch will flash every time a hit is scored.[CR]3) The fire rolls along the ground so you may have to jump a couple of times to avoid it. Don't get too close to the paws or the dog will claw you.[CR]4) Continue to watch the dog crouch down and attack. Eventually, you will have housebroken the animal.[CR]SERGEANT CLAW (Vitality unknown) : At the middle of Stage III, you will be on an island. Follow the gnome's advice regarding this boss.[CR]1) When the Sergeant is standing up, none of your attacks will affect him. It is only when he is crouched down and attacked can you hit him.[CR]2) You will have to power jump (diagonal + jump) over him to avoid his claw.[CR]3) Continue to attack between his attacks when he is crouched down. Eventually, you will take him out.[CR]WIZARD (Vitality : 10) : This is the boss you have to deal with at the end of Stage III.[CR]1) He has two major attacks. He will use fire demons and fire attacks on you.[CR]2) The fire demons can be eliminated with regular attacks. You must, however, jump over the fire attacks which tend to cause a splash effect.[CR]3) This boss spends most of his time in the air so you will have do power jumps in order to attack him. Just watch out for the fire demons he launches.[CR]4) Continue this pattern and you will defeat the Wizard.[CR]DRAGON (Vitality unknown) : This is the boss you deal with halfway through Stage IV.[CR]1) This bosses main attack is its fire breath. It will either hover over your character or shoot flames from an angle. The object is to keep moving so you don't get toasted.[CR]2) The Dragon tends to fly in a pattern. It will stay high for a while, then it will swoop down to attempt to claw your character. Use of the power jump is strongly recommended.[CR]3) You can get in three to four hits between fire breaths if you time things right. In addition, if you are under the Dragon, you can get in an additional one or two hits.[CR]4) Keep moving around and striking and this Dragon should be dinner before you know it.[CR]SORSHA (Vitality : 12) : This is the boss at the end of Stage IV.[CR]1) Sorsha's main claim is that she is fast and she is very nimble on the jump. The best attack is to trap her on a side and go to work.[CR]2) When you have Sorsha near a side, attack rapidly to prevent her from getting in an attack. After she loses a couple of bars of vitality, she will jump out of the way.[CR]3) Pursue her and get her trapped again. Watch out for her counterattacks since they can be rather devastating.[CR]4) Continue this pattern to finish her off.[CR]TWO-HEADED DRAGON (Vitality : 16 per head) : This is the boss at the end of Stage V.[CR]1) You will be on a wooden bridge while both heads assail you with their fiery breath.[CR]2) The heads tend to fire at the same time. After they have fired, get up there and get in a few whacks.  Because there are two heads, your hits will usually be spread out between them. Don't worry about going for a specific head right now.[CR]3) The heads will bob back and forth. If you want to go after one head, then you must wait for the target head to be in front of the other one.[CR]4) Power jumps will definitely save you on this one. Back up and when the heads fire, power jump over the rolling fire to get your attacks in. Watch out for the heads dropping suddenly since that usually means a bite attack.[CR]5) Continue this pattern to finish the critter off.[CR]KAEL : (Vitality : 16) : This is the boss near the end of Stage VI.[CR]1) Kael is a very tough warrior. What he lacks in maneuverability he makes up in attack power.[CR]2) As with Sorsha, try to corner him along the edges so you can pound on him. He does, though, have more of a tendency to jump straight up to another platform, then try to get behind you. Watch for when he jumps up.[CR]3) Continue to move around and trap him on the edges and this powerful warrior will be sent packing.[CR]BAUVMORDA (Vitality : 23) : This boss is the final boss of the game.[CR]1) This is probably one of the toughest bosses you will ever have to face. Bauvmorda has quite an arsenal of attacks that can devastate your character if you're not ready. Follow the gnome's advice regarding protection.[CR]2) Bauvmorda has a variety of attacks, some of them are :[CR]a) She attacks with little crystal-like objects that rotate around her.[CR]b) She attacks from above with fire.[CR]c) She animates a BBQ grill thing when she is down to about 10 vitality. This thing attacks in conjunction with Bauvmorda's attacks.[CR]3) During her crystal attacks, you will be doing a lot of power jumping. Try to get in shots where you can since there is little room to move between the crystals.[CR]4) When Bauvmorda goes airborne, power jump up to attack her. Watch out for the objects that burst into flames. She will tend to go back and forth across the top.[CR]5) When the BBQ grill gets animated, make sure you keep track of it since it is also attacking along with Bauvmorda. It takes too much time and firepower to destroy the grill. Time better spent tearing into Bauvmorda.[CR]6) Continue with this pattern and the world will be safe again.[CR]You will start the game at Stage I (unless you are continuing). You will only have a basic attack and your wits when you start the game. In addition, each stage is timed so you will not only have to beat your enemies, you will also have to beat the clock. The only good news is that if you die, you don't lose any items or upgrades either on your continues or next man. Listed below are the Stages.[CR]STAGE I. Crossroad (Character : Willow)[CR]* Head right until you get to the bridge. Climb up the cliff and cross the bridge. Go to the end and climb the cliff.[CR]* Open the treasure chest for 200G then head to the left. You will see a couple of stone pedestals and a treasure chest at the end. Go over and collect 100G, then head back to the right.[CR]* At the end of the cliff, drop off and you will be next to a gnome. Time to shop. After you exit the shop, go right across the bridge and you will have to tangle with the Sorcerer.[CR]* After that battle, go right to the treasure chest and collect the Holy Water. Then go down the mountain.[CR]* At the bottom, on a ledge is another gnome. Go chat with him. After you exit the shop, go to the right. Be quick since the rock will sink under your weight.[CR]* Keep going right and at the end you will have to deal with the Devil Dog.[CR]STAGE II. Cherlindrea's Forest (Character : Madmartigan)[CR]* Go right until you get under a balcony. Jump up and head to the left. Go all the way left to open the treasure chest and get the 200G.[CR]* Go back right and get onto the next balcony (3rd level). Go left to get the next treasure chest of 100G then head right again.[CR]* At the end of the walkway, fall off onto a ledge with a treasure chest to get 100G. Drop down to ground level and head right.[CR]* Enter the shop (press up on the joystick) to do your business. Then exit and head right.[CR]* Go up to the next level then power jump across the two sets of stairs. Continue to climb to the top and go right.[CR]* Jump off the balcony and onto the cart. Your job is to now defend against the soldiers, archers, devil dogs, and eagles dropping rocks.[CR]* After an adventuresome ride, the stage will end.[CR]STAGE III. Fin Raziel's Island (Character : Willow)[CR]* Go up the cliff and head to the top left to chat with the gnome. After you are done shopping, go back down the cliff and head right.[CR]* Upon the next two terraces are treasure chests. They each contain 100G. Finish climbing the mountain and to your right will be a series of stone pedestals.[CR]* You will have to cross eight pedestals, each at varying heights. In addition, eagles will be around to make your journey that much harder.[CR]* The second to last pedestal will sink down, make sure you jump off it to the next one. That one will sink also so quickly jump off it to the island. It's time to deal with Sergeant Claw.[CR]* After you take care of the good Sergeant, a stone platform will connect the island you're on to the next island to the right. Go all the way to the end and chat with the gnome.[CR]* Hop into the boat and cross the sea. Be ready for a hard fight with the soldiers, archers, and fish.[CR]* At the end, you will tangle with the Wizard.[CR]STAGE IV. Sorsha's Camp (Character : Madmartigan)[CR]* This stage starts with Madmartigan going up a hill. You will not only have to deal with the soldiers, but also snowballs that are rolling down the hill. At the top of the hill is a gnome. Heed his words about the dragon.[CR]* After chatting with the gnome, you will go downhill again. Open the treasure chest for 100G and proceed right into the cave. At the end is the Dragon.[CR]* After clearing out the dragon, jump up to the next platform and go left. Talk to the gnome. When you exit, continue to head right and jump up on the cave roof. Then power jump left and go to the end.[CR]* You will see a brownie suspended in mid-air. Go over and get him down. From now on, you have an ally who attacks whenever you change the direction you are facing. The brownie's attacks can be quite devastating.[CR]* Go back right and follow along the path. You will pass many tents so be prepared for a big fight with soldiers, spear throwers, and archers. The brownie should greatly help you out.[CR]* Sorsha will be at the end waiting, take her down then jump on the sled with Willow. At the end of this track, make sure you jump to avoid the boulder.[CR]STAGE V. Tir Asleen Castle (Character : Willow or Madmartigan (some players prefer Willow due to distance attacks))[CR]* Head right until you get to the wall. Go up to the next level and get the Holy Water from the treasure chest.[CR]* Head left until you get to the gnome. After doing your shopping, head right again and climb up to the next level.[CR]* Go right to the door and press up to enter the next hallway.[CR]* The main danger here are the walls that drop and the soldiers pushing spiked blocks toward your character. You will need to be quick with the trigger finger to get through this hallway.[CR]* At the end of the path, cross the top platforms to reach the gnome in the upper, right corner.[CR]* Go down and around the spiked pits. You will be heading to your left. Collect the 100G from the treasure chest. At the bottom, head right.[CR]* Go across the wooden bridge to tangle with the Two-Headed Dragon.[CR]STAGE VI.  Nockmaar Castle[CR]* Head right. On the 2nd upper platform is a treasure chest containing 100G. Press up at the end of the walkway to enter the door.[CR]* Keep going right and you will encounter another gnome. After chatting with him, you are faced with a pit of spikes. To the right, you will see a small wooden ledge. Timing is the key to this part. You will have five seconds to jump to the next wood ledge to the right. Do this until your reach the other side.[CR]* Again, another bed of spikes awaits you. The ledges exist for about three seconds now. Cross over and you will be in front of two doors. This is the start of the maze. Going through the wrong door puts you at the beginning of the area it connects to. Go through the left door. The right door will put you back through this first area again.[CR]* In this area, you will be cross pits with spiked ceilings that will descend into them. Again, timing is crucial to prevent damage. You will cross over several of these before you reach three doors. Take the left door. The middle door puts you back into the first area and the right door will make you do the second area again.[CR]* The third area consists of two levels. Both are equally dangerous since you have the soldiers pushing the spiked blocks. Due to not have a ranged weapon, you may need to power jump over these guys. Continue to the right and you will encounter four doors. Two on the top and two on the bottom. Take the upper, right door. The upper, left door leads to the second area; the lower, left door leads to the first area; and the lower, right door leads back to the third area.[CR]* You will tangle with Kael to get through this area. Go through the door and you will change over to Willow.[CR]* Climb the platforms in front of you. You may have to power jump on a few since they are too high to just do a regular jump. Watch out for the projectile and axe throwers in this area. At the top platform, chat with the gnome to do your final stocking up. Then go in the door to deal with Bavmorda.[CR]After you take her down, the credits will roll and your game will be over.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Planners: Kawanorider, Deru-Deru Itoh[CR]Programmers: Yukio Arai (Professor Arai), Kyoko Tomita (Queen Tomita), Yokoyan, Ueyan[CR]Character Designers: Frunky Kazu, Yokota Yokozo (Bakuhatsu Yokozo), Terukun, Hiramacho, Kuribow, Puttsun Midori, Sadakichi, Oyuu, Rinma, Okachan[CR]Music Composer: Ogeretu Kun[CR]Hard Designer: Kucchan[CR]Direction: Yoshiki Okamoto (Kihaji Okamoto)[CR]</plot>

Character designs were based on a popular Japanese manga called 'Destruction of Heaven and Earth' published by Shueisha in Japan and created by Moto Kikaku.[CR]Soundtrack releases :[CR]Tenchi wo Kurau II -Sekiheki no Tatakai -G.S.M.

[CR]* Powerful slash with special wave: backward, forward + attack. Can slice apart some enemies. With Kadan you'll obtain a fire bolt.[CR]* Dash: forward + Jump: It is also possible to combine the attack button to perform a long range attack after the dash (except for Kadan)[CR]* Run and Slash: every direction (backward or forward) + jump (2 times rapidly): this move is similar to the standard special, but the player will not lose energy to perform it, it is possible to move while using it, and the enemies can be hit more than one time in this way: although, some enemies are able to block this attack, if they'll hit the player.[CR]Sometimes, the horse will be used even by some bosses, and the player can get it after the boss will get down. By the way, some bosses are able to use the horse too, and they can benefit from its usage like the player.[CR]Violent Boss Kill : if you'll finish the boss with a special move, you'll execute him in a very brutal way. Most of times the boss will be sliced apart, but you can also decapitate him with determined moves.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Tenchi wo Kurau [B-Board 88622B-3] (1989)[CR]2.
