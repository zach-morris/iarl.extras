This is the FULL UNFILTERED list of games available from the archive.[CR]The Sega Master System is a third-generation home video game console that was manufactured by Sega. It was originally released in 1985 as the Sega Mark III in Japan. After being redesigned prior to its North American launch, the console was renamed Master System.  Both the Mark III and the original Master System models could play with both cartridges and the credit card-sized "Sega Cards", which retailed at lower prices than cartridges but had lower storage capacity.  The Master System also featured accessories such as a light gun and 3D glasses which were designed to work with a range of specially coded games.[CR]Developer:  Sega[CR]Manufacturer:  Sega[CR]Media:  ROM cartridge, Sega Card[CR]CPU:  Z80 running at 4 MHz[CR]Memory:  64 kbits (8 KB)[CR]Sound:  Texas Instruments SN76489[CR]Max.

The game follows the story of the protagonist Alex Kidd in his search for his long lost brother Prince Egle who was captured by the antagonist of the game, the evil Janken the Great. Players will find themselves traversing various platform jumping sequences in this adventure game as they battle their way through 16 stages with various monsters and three bosses before confronting the evil Janken.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Prior to the games beginning Alex studied mysteries of Shellcore on Mount Eternal. Shellcore is a technique allowing a person to alter the size of their fists at will in order to shatter rocks with their bare hands. On his way back home from Mount Eternal he is told his homeland "Radaxian" is in danger and that he may be the key to saving it. The ruler of the planet Janbarik, Janken the Great, has kidnapped Prince Egle and Princess Lora in an attempt to seize power. With many of the citizens turned into stone (seemingly what happens when you lose in Janken) Alex sets off to save the Prince and defeat Janken.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Aside from Janken (see below), gameplay consisted of a variety of stages. Most predominant were traditional platform levels with Alex making it to the end collecting power-ups, money and defeating enemies along the way. The these levels were well varied for the era and were always the left to right levels seen in Super Mario Bros with the opening level seeing Alex descend the screen into an impromptu "water level" which is integrated into the first level. The game also featured two special levels where Alex would fly a pedal powered helicopter, avoiding obstacles and shooting enemies. Alex also used a motorbike which he could purchase from stores occasionally located in levels. The bike moved by itself at full speed with the player responsible for jumping. Levels ended with the aforementioned Janken stages.Janken[CR]A key aspect to the gameplay is the focus on "Janken," which is the Japanese equivalent of Rock, Paper, Scissors. During the game players must win two out of three matches against the bosses within the game by taking part in Janken matches. A different take on more traditional boss fights where usually the player has some control over how the outcome would be due to their level of skill however with Janken matches there is a 50/50 chance of success or failure. However there is a number of ways to predict the decision of an enemy boss. One of them requires the player to have picked up the telepathy ball which allows the player to see which decision a boss is going to make. It should be noted however that the telepathy ball was largely useless as the computer would often "change it's mind" at the last second or scroll through all choices without stopping. The other is that each match with a boss would be identical and their choices would always be the same. Although losing a match would make the choices for future bosses unpredictable.[CR]Game Versions[CR]Initially upon release in 1986 Alex Kidd was released on cartridge but then from around 1990 onwards the game was built into the hardware for different versions of the Sega Master System in various regions of the world. The most notable difference between the "built in" and cartridge version is the food Alex eats on the map screen. In the cartridge version of the game Alex is seen to be eating onigiri in the "built in" version he is seen eating a hamburger. This difference could have been Sega's way of making Western Audiences relate to Alex better if he is seen eating an iconic food of Western culture. The 2012 Xbox Live Arcade/Playstation Network bundle runs the cartridge version by default, but any region or variation can be selected through the options menu.[CR]SEGA AGES[CR]As part of the SEGA AGES Online initiative, the game will hit Xbox Live Marketplace and PlayStation Network on May 23rd in Japan. For the PlayStation 3, the title is released for &#165;600. For the Xbox 360, the title is released in a bundle with The Super Shinobi and Super Hang-On for 800 MS Points.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Aggregate scoresAggregatorScoreGameStats9.0 / 10Review scoresPublicationScoreAllgame (SMS) (Wii) (PS3)Computer and Video Games87%86%Eurogamer7/10GameTrailers10/10IGN9/10 (SMS)9/10 (Wii)Defunct GamesB+Game Freaks 3659.5/10GameHall9.3/10G&#233;n&#233;ration 499%Mean Machines Sega86%RetroGarden4/5Sega Pro95%S: The Sega Magazine93%AwardsEntityAwardIGNEditor's ChoiceCritical Reception[CR]The game has been critically acclaimed since its release. In 1987, the French magazine G&#233;n&#233;ration 4 gave the game ratings of 96% for graphics and 85% for sound, with an overall score of 99%. In 1989, British magazine Computer and Video Games gave it a score of 87% (Computer and Video Games, Complete Guide to Consoles, issue 1, Winter 1989, page 47). Later, in 1991, they gave it ratings of 84% for graphics, 78% for sound, 86% for playability, and 85% for lastability, with an overall score of 86%. They described the game as "Sega's answer to Mario" and a "madcap platform romp through a multitude" of side-scrolling levels "with hidden bonuses and screens," a "wacky" minigame based on rock-paper-scissors, and "absolutely hilarous gags," concluding that the "absorbing gameplay will have you glued to your screen for hours on end."[1][CR]The November 1991 issue of Sega Pro magazine gave the game a 95% score, stating that it is the "first" and "ultimately the best" of "the Alex Kidd adventures." They concluded that, with "so much to do and so many different ways of doing it, this is one of those games you will keep coming back to even when you have finished it completely." (Sega Software Showdown, Sega Pro, issue 1, November 1991, page 19) The October 1992 issue of Mean Machines Sega gave it an 86% score, stating that it is "the first" in the Alex Kidd series "and it's still one of the best." They criticized the graphics for being not "so hot" but praised the "blend of platforming and puzzles" which "work well" and concluded that it is an "entertaining platform romp."Retrospective Reception[CR]The game has an average press score of 9 out of 10 on GameStats, based on 6 professional reviews, making it the highest-scoring game for the Master System.[2][CR]In a 2008 retro review, IGN gave Alex Kidd a score of 9 out of 10 and an "Editor's Choice" award, calling it "an exceptional platformer with loads of action and some great puzzle-solving challenges" that "still holds up remarkably well."[3] IGN also gave the Wii Virtual Console release a score of 9 out of 10.[4][CR]The review website Honest Gamers awarded the title a 9 out of 10, complimenting its "inimitable" music, "innovative" use of different items, and balanced level of difficulty.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Alex Kidd in Miracle World was released as a direct competitor to the juggernaut that was Super Mario Bros, to try and bring the Master System's sales up to the level of the NES. Sega needed the mascot and Alex was to be it.[CR]The game was well received at the time by the press, and was by no means unpopular in North America, but the strength of the Mario brand and the NES popularity, particularly in the USA, could not be reversed and the Master System continued to sell poorly in comparison, at least in Japan and North America.[CR]In Europe and South America, however, Alex Kidd in Miracle World was a phenomenal success, outselling Super Mario Bros in both these regions, helping the Master System outsell the NES in these territories.[CR]Alex Kidd in Miracle World spawned five sequels, even branching into the 16-bit era, but by then the brand's strength was minimal in comparison to Mario and Sega dropped the series. One year later, the first Sonic the Hedgehog game launched, with that character being more directly referenced as a Sega mascot than Alex Kidd ever was, at least in North America.Popular Culture[CR]The French pop punk band Chunk!

In game 4 no points are earned at all, and you'll loose if the character gets stuck and the screen scrolls over him.[CR]The game has only two songs, one played at the title screen, the other played during all gameplay.

The game was originally developed by Artech Digital Entertainment in 1986. It was released for numerous home computer systems as well as the Sega Master System and the Atari 7800.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Preperation[CR]Players select either practice or mission mode. In mission mode, players can choose which type of targets they will encounter; V-1 rockets, trains, U-boats, and bombers. Players then are presented with an intelligence report; this displays the targets the player will encounter and where, weather information, available weapons, and outlines the mission orders.[CR]After this, players pick which ammo they want to carry with them. Players can choose from bombs, rockets, bullets, and extra fuel.[CR]Players are then presented with a short cutscene, comprised of a sequence of photos, showing the protagonist getting into the plane.Flight[CR]During flight, players are presented with many controls and displays: the altitude meter, a compass, a basic map, speed indicator in MPH, the damage display, and the flight stick. Players can also look left and right - this can be used to view the engines to look for damage. As well as this, the left and right views also allow the player to view additional controls and displays; these include the fire extinguisher (to put out engine fires), the RPM display, the ability to boost the engines (which uses up more fuel), individual controls for the left and right engines (if one fails, the other can work harder), the flap control, gear control, and trim control.[CR]As players fly to their target, they can randomly encounter enemy fighters. These enemies can be dispatched by shooting them down with the weapons that the player brought on board during the  preparation portion of the game.[CR]Upon getting shot; the plane receives bullet holes, sparks appear, the dial screens can crack or break, switches can fail, and the plane becomes more difficult to control. If too much damage is taken, the pilot can die and the game will be over.[CR]Players do not need to actively land the plane, but in order to land correctly, the plane must have the right altitude and the landing gears must be down.Weapons Bay[CR]In the weapons bay view, players can use bombs or rockets to target enemies below them (U-boats or trains). From this view, players can control the hatches, view ammunition supplies, and engage the extra fuel tanks.Weather[CR]The game includes various weather conditions. These conditions include cloudy, clear skies, darkness, and stormy weather. In cloudy conditions; players can fly above, below, or through clouds for cover.

There are several stages in the game accessible through different doors in the main hall (there are also hidden doors that can lead to rooms with a good amount of pickups, or even some that can serve as short cuts), each housing an imprisoned member of Gomez's family. To free his family, Gomez must traverse each stage and defeat a boss.[CR]Pickups include: hearts which increase health; a sword that is lost after taking damage; a rapid firing marble like item, a power up that is also lost after taking damage; and yellow dollar signs, one hundred of which will award the player with an extra life.[CR]Once Gomez frees Uncle Fester, Wednesday, Pugsley, and Grandmama, he can then enter the final area of the game to save his wife, Morticia.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1993</releasedate>				<year>1993</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>Flying Edge, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>2.9</rating>				<videoid>8P7P5QN9vCo</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3056</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/582283-the-addams-family</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/addams-family___</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-addams-family/3030-2865/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8319</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3056-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/6/8/3/43683_back.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/276886-the-addams-family-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/276887-the-addams-family-sega-master-system-screenshot-creepy-intro.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/276888-the-addams-family-sega-master-system-screenshot-starting-level.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/276889-the-addams-family-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-game-s.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/276890-the-addams-family-sega-master-system-screenshot-your-inventory.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/276891-the-addams-family-sega-master-system-screenshot-somebody-is.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/276892-the-addams-family-sega-master-system-screenshot-money-hangs.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/276893-the-addams-family-sega-master-system-screenshot-this-skeleton.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/276894-the-addams-family-sega-master-system-screenshot-what-is-this.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/276895-the-addams-family-sega-master-system-screenshot-clear-and.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3056-1.jpg</fanart1>				<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3056-2.jpg</fanart2>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/EDn7ofx.png</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Aerial Assault (USA)">				<description>Aerial Assault (USA)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FAerial%20Assault%20%28USA%29.zip" size="95047" />				<title_clean>Aerial Assault</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] The player takes the role of a Freedom Fighter who has to destroy five targets, which includes: the Vinsk, teh CB-53 Bomber, El and two cliff fortresses.

It was designed by legendary Sega game developer Yu Suzuki. It was ported onto many systems, including Sega's own Sega Master System just a few months after the Arcade launch, but most of them weren't able to match the original Arcade version's visceral speed and graphical/sound quality.[CR]It is the first game among a series of franchise sequels such as After Burner II, After Burner III and the 2006 release of After Burner Climax which ran on the then newly developed SEGA Lindbergh arcade hardware. After Burner II was re-released in 2004 for the Playstation 2, in the SEGA AGES 2500 series of budget anniversary re-releases.After Burner Arcade Machine[CR]In After Burner the player controls a F-14 Tomcat, a type of jet, and the object of the game is simply to shoot down other enemy jets while evading their return fire with deft maneuvers. The player-controlled Tomcat is equipped with a machine gun and a small number of missiles as a secondary weapon which replenishes after each completed stage.[CR]The original After Burner machine is a rarity, exclusively available in the Japanese Arcades. It was controlled with a simulating flight stick, with buttons that controlled the cannon and missile weapons. Movement such as dropping/gaining altitude and barrelrolling was also perfomed by movements with the flight stick.[CR]The arcade version also featured a deluxe cabinet, which rotated according to the player's movements (much like Space Harrier and Galaxy Force). This was featured in the arcade scene of the 1991 hit movie Terminator 2: Judgement Day, where it was being played by a teenage John Connor.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Blind Spots[CR]In some levels of After Burner you can hold the upper-left portion of the control pad/joystick and enemy fighters will miss you even when they get the radar lock. This is very useful for avoidingbig dog fights.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Blind Spots[CR]*NOTE* This trick does not help on enemy fortresses.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Continue[CR]When you lose all your lives, and the Game Over screen appears, press Button 1 and 2 at the same time, to continue where you left off.

One was developed and published by Virgin Interactive and the other by Capcom. It is the Capcom version that made an appearance on the SNES - and much later the Game Boy Advance - while the Virgin Interactive game was released initially for the Sega Genesis and later ported to the NES, Game Boy, Game Boy Color and DOS and Amiga home computers. It is also of note that alongside the official NES game, there were two unofficial ports of the same game and another illegitimate one of Capcom's version.[CR]In both games, the player must guide Aladdin through several locations seen in the 1992 movie of the same name. In the Virgin Interactive game, Aladdin has a sword which he can use to attack enemies, however in the Capcom version the only weapons are apples scattered around the levels which are used temporarily stun guards, who can only be killed if Aladdin jumps on their head.[CR]The third game was made by Sega for the Game Gear and Master System. It follows the plot of the movie more closely than the other two games, and instead of being a straightforward platformer, it plays more like Prince of Persia; most levels have Aladdin solving minor puzzles to progress, rather than defeating enemies and navigating platforms (However, other levels do take place in a running perspective, requiring traditional platformer skills).[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The plot in both titles is taken directly from the film so it may not be new to many players. The story is based on an Arab folktale by the same name from One Thousand and One Nights (Though many aspects have been changed by Disney). Players control a street urchin by the name of Aladdin who meets a young princess named Jasmine. The Grand Vizier Jafar wants Jasmine for his bride and needs Aladdin to get the magic lamp from the Cave of Wonders for him. Things don't work out the way they were supposed to and Aladdin gets stuck with the lamp, as well as three wishes. Then, more things go wrong and eventually a battle between Jafar and Aladdin occurs. Aladdin comes out victorious, frees the genie, and gets engaged to the princess.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Genesis version of the game scores of 9,8,9 and 8 out of ten. Ed Semrad wrote, "What happened to the Genesis!?! Suddenly, all of the latest titles are some of the best ever seen! This cart has got to be seen to be believed! The animation is absolutely flawless, making it look just like the animated movie -- literally! The slapstick humor of the movie is also retained...".[CR]Danyon Carpenter wrote, "...Aladdin takes many ideas from side-scrollers and turns it into a slapstick game everyone can enjoy. The sound effects are right on the money and the animation has yet to be rivaled. No other game comes close when comparing animation...".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Invulnerability[CR]On the Stage Password screen, enter the following code for invulnerability:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Invulnerability[CR]At the Title Screen, press, Up, Right, Down, Left two times to access the Test Mode Menu.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Stage Passwords[CR]Enter the appropriate password to go to the desired stage:</plot>				<releasedate>11/11/1993</releasedate>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.0</rating>				<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>				<videoid>XWwgY2CVKTE</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2867</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570184-disneys-aladdin</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/disneys-aladdin_</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/disneys-aladdin/3030-19944/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8335</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2867-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2867-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/46444-disney-s-aladdin-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/149164-disney-s-aladdin-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/46444-disney-s-aladdin-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart5>				<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/149164-disney-s-aladdin-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart6>				<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2867-1.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2867-2.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2867-3.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2867-4.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2867-5.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2867-6.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2867-7.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2867-8.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59516-disney-s-aladdin-sega-master-system-screenshot-introduction.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/59517-disney-s-aladdin-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2867-1.jpg</fanart1>				<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2867-2.jpg</fanart2>				<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2867-3.jpg</fanart3>				<fanart4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2867-4.jpg</fanart4>				<fanart5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2867-5.jpg</fanart5>				<fanart6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2867-6.jpg</fanart6>				<fanart7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2867-7.jpg</fanart7>				<fanart8>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2867-8.jpg</fanart8>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2867.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Aleste (Japan)">				<description>Aleste (Japan)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FAleste%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="68461" />				<title_clean>Aleste</title_clean>				<plot>Your planet has been overrun by the meanest mutant vegetation ever created in a genetics laboratory.

It is heavily based on Anmitsu Hime, a tie-in game for an unrelated Japanese manga and anime TV show. Alex Kidd: High Tech World is a modified version of Anmitsu Hime. The game's original female protagonist, the princess Anmitsu Hime, was replaced with Sega's male mascot Alex Kidd, as part of the Alex Kidd franchise.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]A new arcade - the titular High Tech World - has just opened near Alex Kidd's castle home. He wants to go play some Sega games, but the only map has been torn to pieces! He will need to hurry if he is to make it before closing time![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game's levels alternate between two distinct styles of play:Adventure[CR]The castle and town (levels 1 and 3) are large, free-roaming areas with emphasis on exploration and puzzle solving. Some events occur according to the in-game clock which normally runs in real-time, but jumps ahead by 5 minutes every time Alex opens a door. If the clock reaches 5pm, the arcade closes and the game is over.Platforming[CR]The more civilized areas of the world are connected by dangerous backwoods paths (levels 2 and 4) which Alex must traverse while under constant attack by ninjas. These sections are more traditional and straightforward in design - Alex can jump and shoot projectiles, and the goal is simply to make it from one side of the screen to the other. Any money collected in level 2 can be spent on items in the following adventure area. The clock continues to run down in real-time.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Exit Castle at 11:55[CR]Enter this case-sensitive code, case sensitive to leave the castle at 11:55:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Exit Castle at 11:55[CR]To start the game with all the Map Pieces, enter this code (case-sensitive):[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Get Extra GP[CR]Shoot the yellow clouds on the Ninja sections five times to reveal boxes worth 200 GP</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1989</releasedate>				<year>1989</year>				<genre>Action, Strategy</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.0</rating>				<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>				<videoid>uSDaLK-su48</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>5536</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588026-alex-kidd-high-tech-world</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/alex-kidd-high-tech-world</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/alex-kidd-high-tech-world/3030-7108/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/7438</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5536-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/5536-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/153934-alex-kidd-high-tech-world-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/153934-alex-kidd-high-tech-world-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37470-alex-kidd-high-tech-world-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37471-alex-kidd-high-tech-world-sega-master-system-screenshot-menu.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37475-alex-kidd-high-tech-world-sega-master-system-screenshot-map.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37483-alex-kidd-high-tech-world-sega-master-system-screenshot-mama.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37484-alex-kidd-high-tech-world-sega-master-system-screenshot-the.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37485-alex-kidd-high-tech-world-sega-master-system-screenshot-alex.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37486-alex-kidd-high-tech-world-sega-master-system-screenshot-name.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37487-alex-kidd-high-tech-world-sega-master-system-screenshot-don.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37488-alex-kidd-high-tech-world-sega-master-system-screenshot-out.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37489-alex-kidd-high-tech-world-sega-master-system-screenshot-alex.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/5536-1.jpg</fanart1>				<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/5536-2.jpg</fanart2>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/5ZBsJ6i.png</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Alex Kidd - The Lost Stars (World)">				<description>Alex Kidd - The Lost Stars (World)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FAlex%20Kidd%20-%20The%20Lost%20Stars%20%28World%29.zip" size="120871" />				<title_clean>Alex Kidd - The Lost Stars</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Alex Kidd: The Lost Stars (&#12450;&#12524;&#12483;&#12463;&#12473;&#12461;&#12483;&#12489; &#12470;&#12539;&#12525;&#12473;&#12488;&#12473;&#12479;&#12540;&#12474;) is the second game in the Alex Kidd series. It is a platform game in which the characters are searching for the twelve zodiac signs. The game appeared on the Sega Master System and also in the arcades. The two versions are very similar, although the arcade version features superior graphics and a two-player co-operative mode. The arcade release came first, a mere month after the release of Alex Kidd in Miracle World. The Master System port came later, with the Wii Shop release coming in 2009.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Alex Kidd: The Lost Stars features Alex Kidd (and Stella, if playing the Arcade version in multiplayer) searching for the twelve star signs of the Aries Constellation, which were stolen by Ziggurat. Ziggurat previously tried to capture them some 5,000 years ago but was stopped by Alex Kidd. Now, you have to go through twelve levels (and then go through them again...) to save Miracle World.[CR]There are seven levels in the game. At the end of the seventh level, you are teleported back to the first level and must redo the six levels again; this time facing different or a greater amount of enemies than before. Items around the levels include a 'J' block which allows Alex to jump higher, 'S' which replenishes arrows, and 'SP' which replenishes time. If time runs out, Alex loses a life and must start over from the nearest check point.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]The game features seven stages which Alex Kidd must complete before facing Ziggurat.Aries &amp; Libra[CR]The first stage features a whimsical setting. Packs of cards and small dogs challenge Alex Kidd in this stage.Taurus &amp; Scorpio[CR]The second stage of the game is set in a futuristic environment. Laser beams, hand rails and holes are just some of the obstacles facing the player.Gemini &amp; Sagittarius[CR]A horror themed level. Alex Kidd must navigate past zombies, giant killer marrows and, strangely enough, naked boys with sunglasses, to reach the end.Cancer &amp; Capricorn[CR]The game's first and only underwater stage. Features dangerous jellyfish and squid.Leo &amp; Aquarius[CR]A somewhat Jurassic-themed stage. A huge dinosaur head set piece features towards the end, as well as a short balloon ride obstacle.Virgo &amp; Pisces[CR]A lava level makes up the penultimate stage in the game. Various strange green enemies try to stop Alex Kidd.Ziggurat[CR]The final stage. Alex Kidd must navigate the platforms of this space-themed level before he reaches Ziggurat and finally saves Miracle World.[CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]The Arcade version of Alex Kidd: The Lost Stars features a two-player co-operative multiplayer mode. The second player controls a female counterpart to Alex Kidd named Stella. The multiplayer mode did not make the transition to the Master System.[CR]Release dates[CR]Alex Kidd: The Lost Stars was originally released in the Arcade in 1986. The game was ported to the Sega Master System in 1988. The Master System version was later ported to the Wii Virtual Console on March 9, 2009 (in North America) and on April 17, 2009 (in PAL regions).[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1989</releasedate>				<year>1988</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>2.6</rating>				<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>				<videoid>sU226PphCxk</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>5498</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588025-alex-kidd-the-lost-stars</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/alex-kidd-the-lost-stars</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/alex-kidd-the-lost-stars/3030-16061/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/7397</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5498-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/5498-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/89314-alex-kidd-the-lost-stars-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/89314-alex-kidd-the-lost-stars-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37966-alex-kidd-the-lost-stars-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37967-alex-kidd-the-lost-stars-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-dog.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37968-alex-kidd-the-lost-stars-sega-master-system-screenshot-killer.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37969-alex-kidd-the-lost-stars-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-monorail.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37970-alex-kidd-the-lost-stars-sega-master-system-screenshot-oh-you.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37971-alex-kidd-the-lost-stars-sega-master-system-screenshot-alex.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37972-alex-kidd-the-lost-stars-sega-master-system-screenshot-bluehead.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37973-alex-kidd-the-lost-stars-sega-master-system-screenshot-look.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37974-alex-kidd-the-lost-stars-sega-master-system-screenshot-alex.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/37975-alex-kidd-the-lost-stars-sega-master-system-screenshot-look.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/5498-1.jpg</fanart1>				<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/5498-2.jpg</fanart2>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/AMGUGrb.png</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Alex Kidd BMX Trial (Japan)">				<description>Alex Kidd BMX Trial (Japan)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FAlex%20Kidd%20BMX%20Trial%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="72241" />				<title_clean>Alex Kidd BMX Trial</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Playing as Alex Kidd, the objective of the game is for the player to make their way through a obstacle course and get to the main exit without allowing the other competitors to knock Alex off his bike.[CR]The player will spend a lot of the time hitting ramps that will send Alex jumping over rivers and along the way can collect power-ups such as additional time on the clock, more energy and even jets that will allow Alex to fly past obstacles, but the player is only able to collect these power-ups if Alex can perform a wheelie as he rides over them.[CR]When the player begins a new game they will start off in Blackwood Forest, and as they make their way through that stage, depending on the exit the player takes, they have the chance of reaching destinations like Cactus Desert, South Seas, Pyramid River or even Radaxian (Alex's homeland). The game will come to an end when the player runs out of energy.[CR]The game can only be played with the special paddle controller that originally came with the game.

The game follows the story of the protagonist Alex Kidd in his search for his long lost brother Prince Egle who was captured by the antagonist of the game, the evil Janken the Great. Players will find themselves traversing various platform jumping sequences in this adventure game as they battle their way through 16 stages with various monsters and three bosses before confronting the evil Janken.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Prior to the games beginning Alex studied mysteries of Shellcore on Mount Eternal. Shellcore is a technique allowing a person to alter the size of their fists at will in order to shatter rocks with their bare hands. On his way back home from Mount Eternal he is told his homeland "Radaxian" is in danger and that he may be the key to saving it. The ruler of the planet Janbarik, Janken the Great, has kidnapped Prince Egle and Princess Lora in an attempt to seize power. With many of the citizens turned into stone (seemingly what happens when you lose in Janken) Alex sets off to save the Prince and defeat Janken.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Aside from Janken (see below), gameplay consisted of a variety of stages. Most predominant were traditional platform levels with Alex making it to the end collecting power-ups, money and defeating enemies along the way. The these levels were well varied for the era and were always the left to right levels seen in Super Mario Bros with the opening level seeing Alex descend the screen into an impromptu "water level" which is integrated into the first level. The game also featured two special levels where Alex would fly a pedal powered helicopter, avoiding obstacles and shooting enemies. Alex also used a motorbike which he could purchase from stores occasionally located in levels. The bike moved by itself at full speed with the player responsible for jumping. Levels ended with the aforementioned Janken stages.Janken[CR]A key aspect to the gameplay is the focus on "Janken," which is the Japanese equivalent of Rock, Paper, Scissors. During the game players must win two out of three matches against the bosses within the game by taking part in Janken matches. A different take on more traditional boss fights where usually the player has some control over how the outcome would be due to their level of skill however with Janken matches there is a 50/50 chance of success or failure. However there is a number of ways to predict the decision of an enemy boss. One of them requires the player to have picked up the telepathy ball which allows the player to see which decision a boss is going to make. It should be noted however that the telepathy ball was largely useless as the computer would often "change it's mind" at the last second or scroll through all choices without stopping. The other is that each match with a boss would be identical and their choices would always be the same. Although losing a match would make the choices for future bosses unpredictable.[CR]Game Versions[CR]Initially upon release in 1986 Alex Kidd was released on cartridge but then from around 1990 onwards the game was built into the hardware for different versions of the Sega Master System in various regions of the world. The most notable difference between the "built in" and cartridge version is the food Alex eats on the map screen. In the cartridge version of the game Alex is seen to be eating onigiri in the "built in" version he is seen eating a hamburger. This difference could have been Sega's way of making Western Audiences relate to Alex better if he is seen eating an iconic food of Western culture. The 2012 Xbox Live Arcade/Playstation Network bundle runs the cartridge version by default, but any region or variation can be selected through the options menu.[CR]SEGA AGES[CR]As part of the SEGA AGES Online initiative, the game will hit Xbox Live Marketplace and PlayStation Network on May 23rd in Japan. For the PlayStation 3, the title is released for &#165;600. For the Xbox 360, the title is released in a bundle with The Super Shinobi and Super Hang-On for 800 MS Points.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Aggregate scoresAggregatorScoreGameStats9.0 / 10Review scoresPublicationScoreAllgame (SMS) (Wii) (PS3)Computer and Video Games87%86%Eurogamer7/10GameTrailers10/10IGN9/10 (SMS)9/10 (Wii)Defunct GamesB+Game Freaks 3659.5/10GameHall9.3/10G&#233;n&#233;ration 499%Mean Machines Sega86%RetroGarden4/5Sega Pro95%S: The Sega Magazine93%AwardsEntityAwardIGNEditor's ChoiceCritical Reception[CR]The game has been critically acclaimed since its release. In 1987, the French magazine G&#233;n&#233;ration 4 gave the game ratings of 96% for graphics and 85% for sound, with an overall score of 99%. In 1989, British magazine Computer and Video Games gave it a score of 87% (Computer and Video Games, Complete Guide to Consoles, issue 1, Winter 1989, page 47). Later, in 1991, they gave it ratings of 84% for graphics, 78% for sound, 86% for playability, and 85% for lastability, with an overall score of 86%. They described the game as "Sega's answer to Mario" and a "madcap platform romp through a multitude" of side-scrolling levels "with hidden bonuses and screens," a "wacky" minigame based on rock-paper-scissors, and "absolutely hilarous gags," concluding that the "absorbing gameplay will have you glued to your screen for hours on end."[1][CR]The November 1991 issue of Sega Pro magazine gave the game a 95% score, stating that it is the "first" and "ultimately the best" of "the Alex Kidd adventures." They concluded that, with "so much to do and so many different ways of doing it, this is one of those games you will keep coming back to even when you have finished it completely." (Sega Software Showdown, Sega Pro, issue 1, November 1991, page 19) The October 1992 issue of Mean Machines Sega gave it an 86% score, stating that it is "the first" in the Alex Kidd series "and it's still one of the best." They criticized the graphics for being not "so hot" but praised the "blend of platforming and puzzles" which "work well" and concluded that it is an "entertaining platform romp."Retrospective Reception[CR]The game has an average press score of 9 out of 10 on GameStats, based on 6 professional reviews, making it the highest-scoring game for the Master System.[2][CR]In a 2008 retro review, IGN gave Alex Kidd a score of 9 out of 10 and an "Editor's Choice" award, calling it "an exceptional platformer with loads of action and some great puzzle-solving challenges" that "still holds up remarkably well."[3] IGN also gave the Wii Virtual Console release a score of 9 out of 10.[4][CR]The review website Honest Gamers awarded the title a 9 out of 10, complimenting its "inimitable" music, "innovative" use of different items, and balanced level of difficulty.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Alex Kidd in Miracle World was released as a direct competitor to the juggernaut that was Super Mario Bros, to try and bring the Master System's sales up to the level of the NES. Sega needed the mascot and Alex was to be it.[CR]The game was well received at the time by the press, and was by no means unpopular in North America, but the strength of the Mario brand and the NES popularity, particularly in the USA, could not be reversed and the Master System continued to sell poorly in comparison, at least in Japan and North America.[CR]In Europe and South America, however, Alex Kidd in Miracle World was a phenomenal success, outselling Super Mario Bros in both these regions, helping the Master System outsell the NES in these territories.[CR]Alex Kidd in Miracle World spawned five sequels, even branching into the 16-bit era, but by then the brand's strength was minimal in comparison to Mario and Sega dropped the series. One year later, the first Sonic the Hedgehog game launched, with that character being more directly referenced as a Sega mascot than Alex Kidd ever was, at least in North America.Popular Culture[CR]The French pop punk band Chunk!

The game follows the story of the protagonist Alex Kidd in his search for his long lost brother Prince Egle who was captured by the antagonist of the game, the evil Janken the Great. Players will find themselves traversing various platform jumping sequences in this adventure game as they battle their way through 16 stages with various monsters and three bosses before confronting the evil Janken.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Prior to the games beginning Alex studied mysteries of Shellcore on Mount Eternal. Shellcore is a technique allowing a person to alter the size of their fists at will in order to shatter rocks with their bare hands. On his way back home from Mount Eternal he is told his homeland "Radaxian" is in danger and that he may be the key to saving it. The ruler of the planet Janbarik, Janken the Great, has kidnapped Prince Egle and Princess Lora in an attempt to seize power. With many of the citizens turned into stone (seemingly what happens when you lose in Janken) Alex sets off to save the Prince and defeat Janken.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Aside from Janken (see below), gameplay consisted of a variety of stages. Most predominant were traditional platform levels with Alex making it to the end collecting power-ups, money and defeating enemies along the way. The these levels were well varied for the era and were always the left to right levels seen in Super Mario Bros with the opening level seeing Alex descend the screen into an impromptu "water level" which is integrated into the first level. The game also featured two special levels where Alex would fly a pedal powered helicopter, avoiding obstacles and shooting enemies. Alex also used a motorbike which he could purchase from stores occasionally located in levels. The bike moved by itself at full speed with the player responsible for jumping. Levels ended with the aforementioned Janken stages.Janken[CR]A key aspect to the gameplay is the focus on "Janken," which is the Japanese equivalent of Rock, Paper, Scissors. During the game players must win two out of three matches against the bosses within the game by taking part in Janken matches. A different take on more traditional boss fights where usually the player has some control over how the outcome would be due to their level of skill however with Janken matches there is a 50/50 chance of success or failure. However there is a number of ways to predict the decision of an enemy boss. One of them requires the player to have picked up the telepathy ball which allows the player to see which decision a boss is going to make. It should be noted however that the telepathy ball was largely useless as the computer would often "change it's mind" at the last second or scroll through all choices without stopping. The other is that each match with a boss would be identical and their choices would always be the same. Although losing a match would make the choices for future bosses unpredictable.[CR]Game Versions[CR]Initially upon release in 1986 Alex Kidd was released on cartridge but then from around 1990 onwards the game was built into the hardware for different versions of the Sega Master System in various regions of the world. The most notable difference between the "built in" and cartridge version is the food Alex eats on the map screen. In the cartridge version of the game Alex is seen to be eating onigiri in the "built in" version he is seen eating a hamburger. This difference could have been Sega's way of making Western Audiences relate to Alex better if he is seen eating an iconic food of Western culture. The 2012 Xbox Live Arcade/Playstation Network bundle runs the cartridge version by default, but any region or variation can be selected through the options menu.[CR]SEGA AGES[CR]As part of the SEGA AGES Online initiative, the game will hit Xbox Live Marketplace and PlayStation Network on May 23rd in Japan. For the PlayStation 3, the title is released for &#165;600. For the Xbox 360, the title is released in a bundle with The Super Shinobi and Super Hang-On for 800 MS Points.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Aggregate scoresAggregatorScoreGameStats9.0 / 10Review scoresPublicationScoreAllgame (SMS) (Wii) (PS3)Computer and Video Games87%86%Eurogamer7/10GameTrailers10/10IGN9/10 (SMS)9/10 (Wii)Defunct GamesB+Game Freaks 3659.5/10GameHall9.3/10G&#233;n&#233;ration 499%Mean Machines Sega86%RetroGarden4/5Sega Pro95%S: The Sega Magazine93%AwardsEntityAwardIGNEditor's ChoiceCritical Reception[CR]The game has been critically acclaimed since its release.

Suddenly the sky was covered with grey clouds and after a flash of lighting a dark figure descended. This figure then grabbed Alex Kidd's girlfriend and then disappeared into thin air.[CR]Before Alex Kidd could figure out what happened, there was another flash of lighting. This time a White Ninja appeared before him. Alex Kidd looked up as the White Ninja spoke.[CR]"The wicked Dark Ninja, whom I banished ten thousand years ago, has returned. He took your girlfriend hostage, in hope of taking control of the Miracle World. I have come to give you my special Ninja Power. Use it wisely to exterminate the Dark Ninja!"[CR]The White Ninja threw a glowing white ball to Alex Kidd and disappeared. The ball filled Alex Kidd with an immense amount of strength and courage. With this Alex Kidd is ready to defeat the Dark Ninja and save his girlfriend.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay is a crossover hybrid of Alex Kidd and Shinobi. In particular, it is an Alex Kidd style parody of the original Shinobi.[CR]Alex Kidd in Shinobi World's most original gameplay mechanic is the wall-to-wall jump, which it was the first known game to use. Building on the basic wall jump in the Sega Master System version of Rastan, Alex Kidd in Shinobi allowed Alex Kidd to jump between walls, as a way of climbing up levels. It required precise timing, adding an element of challenge to the game. This mechanic would later be used in the Sega Master System version of Ninja Gaiden, Super Mario 64, and the 3D Ninja Gaiden titles, among other games.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Aggregate scoresAggregatorScoreSega Retro85% (10 reviews)Review scoresPublicationScoreComputer and Video Games92%90%Joystick91%Mean Machines Sega90%Sega Power80%Sega Pro88%S: The Sega Magazine88%VicioJuegos84%[CR]In an early preview, the August 1990 issue of Computer &amp; Video Games magazine referred to the game as a parody of Shinobi.[CR]Alex Kidd in Shinobi World was critically acclaimed upon release, with an average aggregate score of 85% from Sega Retro, based on ten reviews.

They stated it is "a platform chop-socky game" with "top-notch" graphics and "excellent" sound, including "cutesy version of the Shinobi title music!"

[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Alien Storm is a side-scrolling brawler for up to three players in the Arcade version, two players in the Genesis version, and one in the Master System version. Players take control of one of the three members of the 'Alien Busters' over six stages, each containing multiple levels and boss battles.[CR]Players fight multiple types of aliens in the game, each move and attack differently, some using the environment to attack or hide from danger. Killing some aliens will drop power-ups, giving the player either extra lives, energy or health.[CR]Each character has unlimited usage of various short-range attacks, e.g. punches, kicks. Along with these standard attacks, each character has their own individual weapon and a special attacks which differ greatly depending on the game's version. [CR]Gordon summons a U.S. Air Force starship that drops bombs across the street (in the Master System version he has Karen's special, a ballistic missile strike). [CR]Scooter will teleport out of his present location and leave a series of bombs that will blow up on the appearance of aliens, after which he will re-appear (in the Mega Drive version he just explodes, leaving his head, which his new body returns to retrieve). [CR]Karen calls down a nuclear missile, which incinerates every foe on the screen. [CR]A large amount of energy is depleted by using each character's special attack, and cannot be used if the energy of the player's character is too low. [CR]At the end of each mission is a bonus stage, where the side-scrolling gameplay shifts to either a shooting gallery perspective where the player must take out the aliens that pop out of various locations, or an auto-scrolling running section that is similar to the side scrolling mode but features ranged weapons.

In the US arcade version, Gordon is dressed in blue and Karen is in red. The arcade original only features a single boss that has three distinct forms.

At the beginning of the first level, Zeus fires lightning into the ground, commanding a centurion to "Rise from your grave!" The centurion begins each level with a few attacks. He can perform a standard punch, a ducking punch, a jumping punch, a shin kick, a vertical kick, or a jumping kick. If he kills a white wolf enemy and grabs the flying orbs they leave behind, Zeus yells " Power Up!" and the centurion grows much more muscular, with more powerful punches and kicks. After collecting three orbs, he transforms into one of the following creatures:Level 1 - Wolf: The wolf's punches shoot out fireballs and his kick attack is replaced with a horizontal dash that quickly moves across the screen, killing any enemy in its path.Level 2 - Dragon: The dragon can fly across the screen. His punch is replaced with a lightning bolt that shoots out of the dragon's mouth. His kick is replaced with a radial lightning storm that kills any nearby enemies.Level 3 - Bear: The bear's punch attack is a short-ranged breath attack that turns enemies into stone, which can then be smashed. For his kick attack, the bear becomes an invincible spinning ball that flies straight up, or can be moved in an arc.Level 4 - Tiger: The tiger shoots a fireball from his fists when punching, just like the wolf. His kick is an up-and-down invincible dash.Level 5 - Golden Wolf: The golden wolf has the same moves as the wolf.[CR]Each level scrolls automatically to the right, with enemies advancing on the centurion throughout the level. The centurion can take several hits before he is killed. At the end of each level, the centurion faces off with the evil boss Neff, who transforms into a hideous monster capable of withstanding many attacks.

This tennis game does not have any other notable tennis stars to note but features many game play options like practice, tournament and skins tournament that makes this game unique from other tennis games before it.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game uses the same rules of tennis that is played today. A player must get over 40 points to win a game, 6 games to win a set and win 2 sets out of the 3 to finish the full match. The game allows the player to play either singles or doubles in either tournament or skins tournament. They can even select what court surface to play on like grass, clay, hard or indoor. After the player selects a type of game, they will have a choice of any of these players: Andre AgassiTiger BallRon PepperDon MattBob "Bit" ChinGeorge KingCarol ArkCassie Nova[CR]Each athlete has attributes for them like speed, strength (backhand, forehand and server) and accuracy (backhand, forehand and server) which makes the choice of athlete an interesting one. Once an athlete has been selected, two main buttons will be used during the match. The (A) button will help the player lob the ball in the air while the (B) button will help them hit the ball normally (this is for the Genesis version). When the ball is served or hit on the player's side of the court, they must get as close as possible to the ball and hit it back. The player can use either a backhand or forehand depending on their position before hitting the ball. They can move around the court and position themselves using the D-pad.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]Practice Mode - This mode allows the player to select an athlete and have a ball machine feed them balls so the player can practice their game. There are no winner or losers in this mode.Tournament Mode - Like a career mode, the player selects an athlete to play as in a tournament and face many opponents before facing the final match and winning it all.Skins Tournament Mode - This is a tournament that places money down on each hit that takes place during the match. Whoever wins a point will receive the total amount of money in the pot. The pot starts with $10 and doubles each hit from there on in.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1993</releasedate>				<year>1993</year>				<genre>Sports</genre>				<studio>Lance Investments</studio>				<nplayers>2</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>1.4</rating>				<videoid>X5l9_ggUHHg</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>1705</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570187-andre-agassi-tennis</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/andre-agassi-tennis</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/andre-agassi-tennis/3030-19171/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/1705-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/1705-1.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/188308-andre-agassi-tennis-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/188309-andre-agassi-tennis-sega-master-system-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/188310-andre-agassi-tennis-sega-master-system-screenshot-court-selection.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/188311-andre-agassi-tennis-sega-master-system-screenshot-player-selection.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/188312-andre-agassi-tennis-sega-master-system-screenshot-serving.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/188313-andre-agassi-tennis-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-forehand.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/188314-andre-agassi-tennis-sega-master-system-screenshot-preparing.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/188315-andre-agassi-tennis-sega-master-system-screenshot-net-action.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2739396-andreagassitennis002.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2739395-andreagassitennis001.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/1705-1.jpg</fanart1>			</game>			<game name="Anmitsu Hime (Japan)">				<description>Anmitsu Hime (Japan)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FAnmitsu%20Hime%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="86149" />				<title_clean>Anmitsu Hime</title_clean>				<plot>Being the Crown Prince of Planet Aries is never easy.

Although the main setting of each level is the same to both characters (forests, caves, deserts, underwater stages, waterfalls and such) the level design for each one may vary. In two player mode (Master System version), players will take turns playing as Ast?rix and Obelix. Both characters jump (by pressing button 2), punch enemies and break blocks (by pressing button 1). Ast?rix can run can run (by pressing and holding button 1 while moving) and double jump (by pressing 2 in the middle of a jump). Ob?lix is stronger and can break several bricks in a row when jumping over them (pressing 1 while jumping), and can also slide down hills (by pressing down at them).[CR]Ast?rix can get some potions (thrown by pressing up and 1), which can break rocks, kill or shrink enemies. Obelix can get miniature menhirs which can be thrown (by pressing up and 1) against enemies. Both characters can also get bones throughout the game, granting access to bonus stages where the player controls Dogmatix. Some levels also involve minor puzzle solving, like pushing switches or moving rock blocks.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/astrix-and-the-secret-mission[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Lives[CR]On the first level, break the rocks and use the water spout to reach the cloud platforms. Go across to find an extra life, go back so where the extra life was is off the screen. Return back to where the extra life was and it will re-appear. Do this until you have 9 lives (the maximum).

In it one could race through two main modes. The first was Senna GP which players could race on a Senna designed track, and the second was the world championship mode.[CR]The world championship mode had two settings: Beginner and Master. The Beginner mode was a straightforward drivers championship, where the driver at the end of the season with the most points was the winner.[CR]The Master mode included the concept of teams and rival drivers. In this mode, players were put in a team with the objective of advancing to better teams until eventually taking Senna's place at the top of the food chain.Meet Nigel Mansell's unlicensed cousin[CR]Players could challenge rival drivers and replace them in the team if they won.[CR]The teams were arranged in 5 tiers with the master himself in a separate class altogether. The game was unlicensed, so all the rival drivers and teams were likenesses of real ones. Even Senna's team in the game was an original team called "Madonna" as opposed to his real team at the time, McClaren.[CR]The tracks were relatively close to their real life counterparts, and Senna advised developers about track characteristics. They even followed the order of the real life Formula 1 calendar. Each track had some unique background elements such as a city or forest. Some tracks even featured rain on random occasions.[CR]Even with all these realistic elements, the games handling could best be described as arcadey. This was characteristic of console racing games of the time. More realistic racing games could be found on the PC, but for many Genesis owners, Ayrton Senna's Super Monaco GP II brought Formula 1 home.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Upon release, Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores: 6,8,6,5 adding, "...this is a game that only a dyed-in-the-wool racer will love. The first SMGP set new standards in driving simulations and, while this version smooths out the rough edges, it does not break any new ground".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]To get to the respective levels, enter these passwords on the Passwords screen:</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1992</releasedate>				<year>1992</year>				<genre>Action, Driving, Racing</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.8</rating>				<videoid>WXabZgy_uwo</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2697</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588154-ayrton-sennas-super-monaco-gp-ii</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/ayrton-sennas-super-monaco-gp-ii</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/ayrton-sennas-super-monaco-gp-ii/3030-8935/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2697-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2697-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/46467-ayrton-senna-s-super-monaco-gp-ii-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/139827-ayrton-senna-s-super-monaco-gp-ii-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/139828-ayrton-senna-s-super-monaco-gp-ii-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/139829-ayrton-senna-s-super-monaco-gp-ii-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/139830-ayrton-senna-s-super-monaco-gp-ii-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/139831-ayrton-senna-s-super-monaco-gp-ii-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/139834-ayrton-senna-s-super-monaco-gp-ii-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/139836-ayrton-senna-s-super-monaco-gp-ii-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/3106/407124-picture_3.png</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/3106/407122-picture_1.png</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/3106/405520-picture_8.png</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Aztec Adventure - The Golden Road to Paradise (World)">				<description>Aztec Adventure - The Golden Road to Paradise (World)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FAztec%20Adventure%20-%20The%20Golden%20Road%20to%20Paradise%20%28World%29.zip" size="85813" />				<title_clean>Aztec Adventure - The Golden Road to Paradise</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Nazca '88: The Golden Road to Paradise is an action game where the player assumes the role of an adventurer named Ni&#241;o as he attempts to find a lost paradise somewhere in Peru.

This involves crossing through deserts, jungles, marshes and ruins, destroying various enemies on the way with found weapons.

The game consists of five parts, each inspired by one of the movie's most memorable scenes:[CR]1. Hoverboard Chase: A Paperboy clone without newspapers, but with isometric levels and lots of enemies to dodge.[CR]2. Jennifer Rescue: Guide Marty's girlfriend Jennifer out of the house without her meeting one of the four family members. Open and close doors to make the persons go from one room to the next in this top-down puzzle sequence.[CR]3. Beat Biff: A side-scrolling beat-em-up sequence in the tradition of Double Dragon. Fight your way through a grim 1985 by jumping, hitting and kicking at Biff's lackeys.[CR]4. Band Puzzle: Rearrange the mixed-up parts of an animated picture of the school band in this sliding block puzzle. The clock is ticking.[CR]5. Hoverboard Chase 2: Another hoverboard sequence, similar to the first one, only this time set in 1955.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Unlimited lives[CR]If you fail at the Bonus Rounds (levels 2 &amp; 4), it takes a life away from you, but will not give you game over and allow you to continue on.  You can use this to your advantage. [CR]Either in the first or third level, allow yourself to lose all but your very last life, and then beat the level.  Lose the following bonus intentionally.

In this one, your goal is to catch the carriage before it drops down the cliff. You take on the role of Doc Brown riding a horse from left to right, fighting your way through birds, flying tomahawks, and all kinds of random obstacles. Doc Brown can only shoot in three directions (up, down, up/right) and duck to avoid birds. The level is borderline cheap, enemies and barriers usually pop in just in front of the horse, recalling bad memories of the infamous race level in Battletoads.  There is also a number of items in this level. Many of them only give scorepoints (e. g. several pieces of laundry the Doc can pick up), others enable a short boost or grant the Doc additional time. The number of remaining lives (three in total) is indicated by a clock in the lower right corner. The sheer number of instant death possibilities alone makes it hard to memorize the fixed pattern.Second levelYou are Marty McFly, posing as Clint Eastwood, and your goal is to defeat six baddies located in two buildings, one of them a large saloon, by means of flying plates.  Please don't hit my heart! The HUD gives you some important information this time. In the upper left corner are six cupboard cutouts of the bad guys. Each enemy takes two hits, after that the respective cupboard turns down. Below is the  high score counter and a small shield, which looks like a failed attempt at drawing a metal plate. Sometimes graphical glitches appear in this area, which are actually supposed to be bullet holes in the shield. Eventually, Marty's heart (!) will be exposed and the next hit instantly leads to a game over since there are no extra lives in this level. To the right of the shield is a stack of plates. Marty can throw ten plates before he has to reload by walking to the table at the bottom of the screen. Quite confusingly, the HUD indicator shows far more plates than ten, rendering it pretty useless. Marty himself can only move sideways, with each position corresponding to a predefined plate trajectory, some of which are clearly violating Newton's laws of physics. Third levelMarty does the Turrican Still controlling Marty, the player is now on a train and has to reach the locomotive. In addition to that, Marty must pick up  intentionally inconspicuously placed rectangular items of unknown purpose. Furthermore, these have to be picked up in a specific order which is given as a string of colored squares in the upper middle of the screen. As if that wasn't complicated enough, the designers also implemented a relentless time limit, giving the player only the tiniest leeway. There is once again a number of arbitrary obstacles (e. g. some sort of hook on a pole), but instead of suffering instant deaths, the player gets punished with a substantial time loss. A crude lifebar (it's really just five red blobs) in the lower right corner indicates Marty's health. If it's completely drained, he falls off the train and several precious seconds are lost yet again. Control wise, Marty is in full Turrican mode here. He can shoot sideways, jump, climb, and even do the famous barrel roll. The controls feel rather sluggish, though. Combined with the crazy time limit and overall difficulty, this level isn't exactly the second coming of Super Mario Brot.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level skip[CR]Pause, hold 1 and then press Up, Down, Left, Right.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1991</releasedate>				<year>1991</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>Image Works</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>2.0</rating>				<videoid>q_lSHkF0Ago</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2700</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570191-back-to-the-future-part-iii</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/back-to-the-future-part-iii</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/back-to-the-future-part-iii/3030-12919/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/13819</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2700-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2700-1.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412468-back-to-the-future-part-iii-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412469-back-to-the-future-part-iii-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412470-back-to-the-future-part-iii-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412472-back-to-the-future-part-iii-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412473-back-to-the-future-part-iii-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/8273/750778-1110559414_05.gif</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/8273/750777-1110559414_01.gif</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/8273/750776-1110559413_05.gif</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/8273/750775-1110559413_01.gif</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/8273/750773-1110559414_04.gif</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2700-1.jpg</fanart1>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/mQ93kaZ.png</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Baku Baku Animal (Brazil)">				<description>Baku Baku Animal (Brazil)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FBaku%20Baku%20Animal%20%28Brazil%29.zip" size="147985" />				<title_clean>Baku Baku Animal</title_clean>				<plot>The Minister approaches the King to tell him that his only daughter, the Princess, wants a new pet.

Master Piggy then sends his pupil, Polly, to participate in the contest.[CR]Baku Baku Animal is a variation on the very often copied Tetris type of game. The game has three different play modes: practice, normal and hard. It also can be played by two players against each other (except for the Master System version).[CR]The objective is to pair animal heads with their respective food. If a rabbit head comes falling, you must make it fall on a pile of carrot tiles, dog heads with bones, panda heads with bamboos and monkey heads with bananas. There is a bonus item, the "BB coin", which will appear from times to times, and remove piled tiles from the playfield. Removed tiles will be sent to the opponent's playfield all at once, increasing the difficulty of the task. Polly will face several contestants, and she'll win when her opponents get their playfield piled to the top.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Start at any level[CR]At the option/password/difficulty menu:</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1998</releasedate>				<year>1998</year>				<studio>Tec Toy Indstria de Brinquedos S.A.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<rating>2.2</rating>				<videoid>OVwrNdyil4M</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2701</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570275-baku-baku-animal</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/baku-baku-animal</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/baku-baku/3030-13577/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2701-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/5/8/7/306587_back.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66669-baku-baku-animal-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66670-baku-baku-animal-sega-master-system-screenshot-first-opponent.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2014/390018-bakuanim_2.png</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2014/389995-bakuanim_12.png</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2014/389994-bakuanim_11.png</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2014/389993-bakuanim_10.png</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2014/389992-bakuanim_9.png</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2014/389991-bakuanim_8.png</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2014/389990-bakuanim_7.png</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2014/389989-bakuanim_6.png</snapshot10>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2701.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Bank Panic (Europe)">				<description>Bank Panic (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FBank%20Panic%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="22926" />				<title_clean>Bank Panic</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bank Panic is a Sega published Arcade game originally developed by Sanritsu. The goal is to scan a dozen doors in a Wild West frontier town bank, allowing innocent citizens to make bank deposits while shooting any outlaws or bombs that appear.[CR]Sega would later port the game on their Sega Mark 1 and Sega Mark 3 consoles, the latter of which is better known to Western gamers as the Master System. The game would receive various other ports for home computers as well.[CR]The game later influenced an iOS game named Westbang.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Each level contains 12 doors. From this doors can either enter customers with intention to deposit money or bandits that come to rob the bank. The player must allow the customer to make the deposit and shoot the outlaws before they shoot back.[CR]Each door has a counter attached to it. To pass the level every counter must be filled with at least one bag of money. There is a time limit to each level and if a counter has only one bag for too long it will disappear making the player to come back there again and wait for another deposit. From time to time, there will be time bombs placed in a door. In that case, another timer shows and the player must shoot the bomb before the timer runs out.[CR]The player loses a life if a bandit shoots them, if the bomb explodes, if the level timer reaches zero or if the player shoots an innocent customer. Sometimes bandits will hide behind customers. Some customers will be tied up and the player has to shoot the rope to free them. In this case, the customer gives 3 bags of money.[CR]Sometimes, especially at the beginning of each level, a small cowboy appears holding a gift that the player must shoot to get bonus points. The player gets point for receiving bags of money and shooting outlaws. If the player doesn&#8217;t shoot the bandit before he draws his gun (which the game considers an "unfair" kill and thus is worth less points), a very quick timer will appear and additional points will be granted to the player by shooting the bandit with as little time as possible left on the timer.[CR]Points scoring[CR]Points by shooting an outlaw:Before he draws his gun: 100 or 200 pointsWith the timer on 0.26-0.33: 300 pointsWith the timer on 0.21-0.25: 600 pointsWith the timer on 0.16-0.20: 700 pointsWith the timer on 0.11-0.15: 800 pointsWith the timer on 0.01-0.10: 1,000 pointsWith the timer on 0.00: 2,000 points for brown shirt gunmanWith the timer on 0.00: 3,000 points for green shirt gunmanWith the timer on 0.00: 5,000 points for red shirt gunmanDeposits:First bag of money: 200 pointsSecond bag of money: 400 pointsThird bag of money: 600 pointsFourth or more bag of money: 1,000 pointsShooting the rope on a customer who is tied up: 3 bags of money worth 1,000 points eachEnd of level bonuses:Money bags 1-12: 50 points eachMoney bags 13-24: 100 points eachMoney bags 25-36: 150 points eachMoney bags 37-48: 200 points eachOthers:Shooting the bomb: 100 pointsIf a woman is held up and the gunman is shot: 500 pointsIf a man is held up and the gunman is shot: 200 points[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]In the last stages of the games, the boy who carries the hats is seen lifting up the woman client's skirts.Alessandro Giuriato and Gary A.

The characters, story and setting were all changed in the international versions because they lacked the license. Even though much was changed in this version, the gameplay stayed the same.[CR]Hokuto no Ken was the third game to be released in the cartridge format in Japan. The format had all but supplanted the earlier Sega Card format, which had less memory space than the new cartridges.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]One of the many boss encounters[CR]Wang has kidnapped Kyoko who is the girlfriend of Riki. The kidnapper also happens to be Riki's rival, and he sets out to rescue Kyoko from Wang. Riki will fight his way through various cities and towns defeating enemies in order to fight against Wang. In the Japanese version, it plays the story of Hokuto No Ken facing familiar enemies up to the final boss, Raoh.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Traverse Japan inspired locations[CR]Black Belt is a side scrolling brawler where the player controls Riki, a martial artist (or Kenshiro, in the Japanese version). Riki will travel through six stages, walking left to right, using his fighting skills to defeat Wang's henchman. Riki is able punch and kick enemies, and upon defeating them the enemies will explode. As he travels he will come across various enemies and mid-bosses, which will eventually lead Riki to confront Wang. In the boss battles the fighting mechanics do not change, and Riki simply uses punches and kicks to be victorious. The only difference is that the player is always facing the boss.[CR]Name changes[CR]Because of the licencing issue, the names of the characters had to have been changed from the Hokuto No Ken characters to generic characters.Black Belt CharactersHokuto no Ken CharactersRikiKenshiroKyokoYuriaRyuShinHawkColonelGontaDevil RebirthOniTokiRitaSoutherWangRaohAppearances from other charactersThe Four Jacks (Club, Spade, Diamond and Mr Heart)Mad SargeFoxUighur[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Bosses Level[CR]After you do the last hit (a punch) in Wang, imediately hold 1 and 2 buttons simultaneously and press Up and Down alternately until the final screen (a black one that contains a text) disappear.

/>				<title_clean>Bobble Bobble</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bubble Bobble is an arcade game created by Taito. The arcade version of the game was released in 1986, with console and computer releases coming soon after. The game is a co-op platformer starring twin dinosaurs named Bub and Bob as they travel through one hundred one-screen levels. Bubble Bobble became very popular, inspiring a number of sequels and spin-offs.[CR]It was one of the first games to feature two-player cooperative play and multiple endings.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]An early level[CR]Bubble Bobble follows Bub and Bob as they venture through 100 different levels. The dinosaurs have the ability to blow bubbles, which they capture enemies within. Once an enemy is captured inside of a bubble, Bub and Bob must pop the bubble to defeat the enemy. Once defeated, the enemy will fly off and turn into a tasty treat, which can be snagged by Bub and Bob for points. The object of each level is to eliminate every foe. When one foe remains, they will become enraged and move faster. If Bub and Bob take too long, ghost whales will come and destroy the dinosaurs. Each level consists of one screen with a complex series of blocks. Bub and Bob can jump through thin layers of blocks, as can their enemies. There are two holes on the top of the screen and two holes on the bottom. All characters can travel through these to the opposite side of the screen.[CR]There is a large number of enemies, all of which have different traits. The most basic of these enemies is a small, square robot that runs around. Others include witches that create boulders,A level shaped like a character[CR]whales that bounce around, helicopter blobs, and more. As the game progresses, more enemy types appear in all sorts of locations, and the challenge comes in figuring out how to take out each type of enemy. Some offensive items that will commonly appear are waterfalls and lightning bolts. Waterfalls will sweep up any characters they pass and dump them down the hole. Lightning bubbles will fly horizontally across the screen, shocking anything they touch. There are also powerups that create short bonus rounds, such as one that spreads large cookies over the screen, and the players must gather them before the time runs out.[CR]Powerups[CR]There are a large variety of powerups to collect in the game, and some must be used to safely complete a level. Each one arrives randomly, and many are quite rare.Yellow Sweetie: Bubble firing speed increasesPurple Sweetie: Long range bubblesBlue Sweetie: Increase bubble firing speed across screenRed Ring: Points increase per bubble firedPurple Ring: Added points every jump performedBlue Ring: Added points for every pixel travelled.Red Shoe: Faster movementClock: Timer freezesOrange Umbrella: Skip 3 levelsRed Umbrella: Skip 5 levelsPurple Umbrella: Skip 7 levelsBlue Cross: Flood screen with water killing all enemiesRed Cross: Shoot fireballs instead of bubblesYellow Cross: Lightning flash kills all enemiesBlue Lamp: Gives effect of all three ringsYellow Lamp: Gives effect of all three SweetiesRed Lamp: Gives effect off both Blue and Yellow LampsPurple Lamp: Kills all enemiesBomb: Kills all enemiesBook: Kills all enemiesDiamond Pendant: Stars flood the screen killing all enemiesLightning Potion: Fires Lightning bolts instead of bubblesRed Bracelet: Causes E.X.T.E.N.D Bubbles to appear at next available opportunityWhite Bracket: A Ball bounces around the stage killing all enemiesFlashing Heart: Enemies freeze, dinosaur becomes invincibleCrystal Ball: Causes Item spawn frequency to increaseDungeon Door With Flames: Secret room with hidden messageWooden Dungeon Door: Only Appears on Lv 50.

In Japan, the Gamest Awards gave it the Silver Award for being one of the four best games of 1986, along with Taito's own Arkanoid, Sega's Fantasy Zone and Tecmo's Rygar (Gamest, The Best Game 2: Gamest Mook Vol. 112, pages 6-26). In Europe, Bubble Bobble was the most popular arcade game on Euromax's nationwide UK charts during the period of May-July 1987, above Capcom's 1942 at second place.[CR]The arcade game also received positive reviews from European critics. In the November 1986 issue of Computer and Video Games, Clare Edgeley described it as an "addictive" game that "sounds quite easy", letting "you in gently", before "the nasties get faster, more of them appear and they're harder to catch." She stated the "continue play facility" is "a great help and allows you to see much more of the game" if "you've got the cash", and the "two player option is more fun as" both "can act as a team" to "clear the screens quickly" and "get to the harder levels." She also noted "the sense of competition is heightened as the player who grabs the fruit gets the points, regardless of who burst the bubbles", which "fast develops into a race against each other." In the April 1987 issue of Crash, Gary Penn described it as a "deceptively simple" arcade game "that proves very addictive and lots of fun to play." He concluded that it was "very compelling" and recommended readers to "Invest a few coins as soon as you can."Home Versions[CR]The home console and computer ports were also well received. Mean Machines gave the Game Boy port of the game a score of 91%, noting that while some changes had been made, the game played identical to the original arcade port and "provides much addiction and challenge".

There are many levels of power for this shot and will take about a level and a half to max it out, increasing in strength and spread over time. Death completely resets the level of the 'shot' and the player must start again from its base level.[CR]There are also green 'S' canisters that will upgrade Speed. This is also completely reset upon death.[CR]The player can also pick up two small squadron planes to assist them that can fire in 4 different directions from a numbered red canister - depending on the number of the squadron canister the player picks up. It is possible to alter the number on those canisters by shooting them. Shooting them too much, however, will destroy them. The squadron planes can be destroyed the same way the player can, by colliding with enemies or their bullets.[CR]There is also the secondary 'Cluster Bomb' that is a powerful area of effect weapon of limited supply which is affected by the number of squadron planes the player has.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Special Battle Wings Title Screen[CR]Soon as you boot the game, hold Down+Left on controller 1 and Up+Right+1+2 on controller 2 to show an alternative title screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level select[CR]At the title screen, hold Up/Left and both button 1 and 2 on controller two.

The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.[CR]As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures.

The arcade version of the game was released in 1986, with console and computer releases coming soon after. The game is a co-op platformer starring twin dinosaurs named Bub and Bob as they travel through one hundred one-screen levels. Bubble Bobble became very popular, inspiring a number of sequels and spin-offs.[CR]It was one of the first games to feature two-player cooperative play and multiple endings.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]An early level[CR]Bubble Bobble follows Bub and Bob as they venture through 100 different levels. The dinosaurs have the ability to blow bubbles, which they capture enemies within. Once an enemy is captured inside of a bubble, Bub and Bob must pop the bubble to defeat the enemy. Once defeated, the enemy will fly off and turn into a tasty treat, which can be snagged by Bub and Bob for points. The object of each level is to eliminate every foe. When one foe remains, they will become enraged and move faster. If Bub and Bob take too long, ghost whales will come and destroy the dinosaurs. Each level consists of one screen with a complex series of blocks. Bub and Bob can jump through thin layers of blocks, as can their enemies. There are two holes on the top of the screen and two holes on the bottom. All characters can travel through these to the opposite side of the screen.[CR]There is a large number of enemies, all of which have different traits. The most basic of these enemies is a small, square robot that runs around. Others include witches that create boulders,A level shaped like a character[CR]whales that bounce around, helicopter blobs, and more. As the game progresses, more enemy types appear in all sorts of locations, and the challenge comes in figuring out how to take out each type of enemy. Some offensive items that will commonly appear are waterfalls and lightning bolts. Waterfalls will sweep up any characters they pass and dump them down the hole. Lightning bubbles will fly horizontally across the screen, shocking anything they touch. There are also powerups that create short bonus rounds, such as one that spreads large cookies over the screen, and the players must gather them before the time runs out.[CR]Powerups[CR]There are a large variety of powerups to collect in the game, and some must be used to safely complete a level. Each one arrives randomly, and many are quite rare.Yellow Sweetie: Bubble firing speed increasesPurple Sweetie: Long range bubblesBlue Sweetie: Increase bubble firing speed across screenRed Ring: Points increase per bubble firedPurple Ring: Added points every jump performedBlue Ring: Added points for every pixel travelled.Red Shoe: Faster movementClock: Timer freezesOrange Umbrella: Skip 3 levelsRed Umbrella: Skip 5 levelsPurple Umbrella: Skip 7 levelsBlue Cross: Flood screen with water killing all enemiesRed Cross: Shoot fireballs instead of bubblesYellow Cross: Lightning flash kills all enemiesBlue Lamp: Gives effect of all three ringsYellow Lamp: Gives effect of all three SweetiesRed Lamp: Gives effect off both Blue and Yellow LampsPurple Lamp: Kills all enemiesBomb: Kills all enemiesBook: Kills all enemiesDiamond Pendant: Stars flood the screen killing all enemiesLightning Potion: Fires Lightning bolts instead of bubblesRed Bracelet: Causes E.X.T.E.N.D Bubbles to appear at next available opportunityWhite Bracket: A Ball bounces around the stage killing all enemiesFlashing Heart: Enemies freeze, dinosaur becomes invincibleCrystal Ball: Causes Item spawn frequency to increaseDungeon Door With Flames: Secret room with hidden messageWooden Dungeon Door: Only Appears on Lv 50.

In Japan, the Gamest Awards gave it the Silver Award for being one of the four best games of 1986, along with Taito's own Arkanoid, Sega's Fantasy Zone and Tecmo's Rygar (Gamest, The Best Game 2: Gamest Mook Vol. 112, pages 6-26). In Europe, Bubble Bobble was the most popular arcade game on Euromax's nationwide UK charts during the period of May-July 1987, above Capcom's 1942 at second place.[CR]The arcade game also received positive reviews from European critics. In the November 1986 issue of Computer and Video Games, Clare Edgeley described it as an "addictive" game that "sounds quite easy", letting "you in gently", before "the nasties get faster, more of them appear and they're harder to catch." She stated the "continue play facility" is "a great help and allows you to see much more of the game" if "you've got the cash", and the "two player option is more fun as" both "can act as a team" to "clear the screens quickly" and "get to the harder levels." She also noted "the sense of competition is heightened as the player who grabs the fruit gets the points, regardless of who burst the bubbles", which "fast develops into a race against each other." In the April 1987 issue of Crash, Gary Penn described it as a "deceptively simple" arcade game "that proves very addictive and lots of fun to play." He concluded that it was "very compelling" and recommended readers to "Invest a few coins as soon as you can."Home Versions[CR]The home console and computer ports were also well received. Mean Machines gave the Game Boy port of the game a score of 91%, noting that while some changes had been made, the game played identical to the original arcade port and "provides much addiction and challenge". The Spectrum version was voted number 58 in the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time. GamesRadar ranked it the 24th best NES game ever made. The staff praised its advancements over other platform games of its time and its use of multiple endings.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]To choose your starting level enter the following code:[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]At the main menu, press Pause and the border will change to blue.

In most versions of the game, the player chose to compete in individual events or an event series. Unlike Epyx previous games, in which players chose a nationality, players get to choose a sponsor. The Commodore 64, for example, includes Maxx-Out, Costa Del Mar, Kawasaki, Santa Cruz, Ocean Pacific, Casio, Auzzie, Spin Jammer, and Ray-D-O, while the NES release adds publisher Milton Bradley to the roster.As a multi-platform game, the visual fidelity of California Games really depends on the machine that is powering it. In general, the art style was heavily informed by Californian imagery. The footbag event has the Golden Gate Bridge as a backdrop. On other platforms where space was at a premium, events were sacrificed. The Atari Lynx and 2600 releases only included four of the events: BMX, surfing, footbag, and halfpipe.Each event featured a different soundtrack, including some renditions of well known hits. Richard Berry's song "Louie Louie" accompanies the titles, while The Safari's hit "Wipe Out" sounds out during the surfing event.[CR]Events[CR]SurfingSet under a crashing pipeline wave, players gain speed to do aerial tricks and avoid falling off their board. Most versions of the game rate the player on a 10.0 scale, though some give points to the number of rotations in an aerial trick.HalfpipePlayers are given a time limit in which to earn points for rotation and hand plant tricks in a skateboarding half pipe. Not only must they execute these tricks, but they must turn their board in time to descend the ramp and keep momentum into the next trick.Flying DiskThis event requires throwing a frisbee to a partner off the screen. Players time their button presses to a meter to execute angle and speed and, once released, gain control of the offscreen player the catch the flying disk. Points are earned for successful catches.BMXPlayers ride along a dirt track with ramps and obstacles, doing wheelies, flips and spins to earn points. They are also judge on the time it takes to reach the goal, which can be impeded by falling off the bike or crashing.FootbagJuggling a hackysack with feet, head, and body, players must keep the bag from touching the ground while doing fancy moves to earn more points. Players can hit seagulls with the bag for bonus points.Roller SkatingPlayers skate along a path running parallel to the beach, doing tricks and spins while avoiding obstacles on the sidewalk.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] New bike[CR]Put your name as KOTARO and then play. Break a record, then play the bonus game. If you win, you will get a new bike.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] New bike[CR]Put your name as NORIKO then play. Break a record then play the bonus game.

The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible in five different events.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]One of the game's five events.[CR]Just like in California Games, there are several events that the player can play through. In California Games II, these five events are hang gliding, jet skiing, body boarding, snowboarding, and skateboarding.

The goal in this game is to drop water balloons in three different tubes, each of which yields points, all while avoiding prematurely falling in the water.Jet Skiing[CR]In the jet skiing minigame, the goal is to complete a course as fast as possible. The player is giving buoy guidelines to follow, as well as time-reducing checkpoints and ramps. If the player fails to complete it in time, they are still awarded points, but less so than a fully completed course would yield.Body Boarding[CR]In the bodysurfing event, the player is put in control of a character swimming in the ocean. The goal is to do tricks off of a large wave in order to gain points. Failure to complete tricks, or falling off of the wave results in penalization for the player.Snowboarding[CR]Snowboarding starts the player off in the middle of a slope. The goal here is to avoid obstacles for as long as possible, and to hit the ramp at the end of the cliff face. Unlike other games, the player is given several falls before the event is failed completely.Skateboarding[CR]Hearkening to games such as Skate or Die, the skateboarding minigame puts the player in control of a skater on a half-pipe course, going through tunnels and doing tricks along the way.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1993</releasedate>				<year>1993</year>				<genre>Sports</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1-8 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<videoid>3Cmk_uc8b4Y</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3080</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570284-california-games-ii</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/california-games-ii</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/california-games-ii/3030-11315/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8261</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3080-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3080-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164669-california-games-ii-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64741-california-games-ii-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64742-california-games-ii-sega-master-system-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2620772-caligamesii001.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/723802-california_games_ii_6.jpg.png</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/723800-california_games_ii_3.png</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/723799-962202303_00.gif</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/723798-962202105_00.gif</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/723797-962202096_00.gif</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/723796-962202088_00.gif</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/723795-962202060_00.gif</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3080-1.jpg</fanart1>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/momX20Z.png</banner1>			</game>			<game name="California Games II (Europe)">				<description>California Games II (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FCalifornia%20Games%20II%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="153573" />				<title_clean>California Games II</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]California Games II is the sequel to 1988's hit, California Games, and a part of Epyx's overarching "Games" series, including Summer Games and Winter Games.

Unlike other games, the player is given several falls before the event is failed completely.Skateboarding[CR]Hearkening to games such as Skate or Die, the skateboarding minigame puts the player in control of a skater on a half-pipe course, going through tunnels and doing tricks along the way.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1993</releasedate>				<year>1993</year>				<genre>Sports</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1-8 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<videoid>3Cmk_uc8b4Y</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3080</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570284-california-games-ii</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/california-games-ii</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/california-games-ii/3030-11315/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8261</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7465/2126833-california_games_2_d7.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3080-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164669-california-games-ii-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64741-california-games-ii-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64742-california-games-ii-sega-master-system-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2620772-caligamesii001.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/723802-california_games_ii_6.jpg.png</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/723800-california_games_ii_3.png</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/723799-962202303_00.gif</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/723798-962202105_00.gif</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/723797-962202096_00.gif</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/723796-962202088_00.gif</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/723795-962202060_00.gif</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3080-1.jpg</fanart1>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/momX20Z.png</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Captain Silver (Japan, Europe)">				<description>Captain Silver (Japan, Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FCaptain%20Silver%20%28Japan%2C%20Europe%29.zip" size="137439" />				<title_clean>Captain Silver</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Captain Silver puts the player in control of the dauntless adventurer Jim Aykroyd, as he attempts to fight his way across several stages to locate the lost treasure of the titular pirate. Each version of the game - the Arcade, the Sega Master System and the NES are all slightly different in their execution, but all play mostly the same.[CR]The Arcade version, released in 1987, has a total of three stages. After defeating the now undead Captain Silver at the end of Stage 3, the player restarts the game with slightly tougher enemies to defeat. The US Master System version was released on a 1mb Cart and has a total of four stages, with two pirate captains (including Captain Silver) as bosses. The Master System versions for Europe, Australia and Japan were all the same 2mb Cart version that instead had six stages, with six bosses instead of the US version's two. The Japan-only NES version is the most divergent from the original Arcade game, as it features more platforming and less swordfighting. There are different bosses and stage layouts, a health gauge instead of the one-hit kill rule found in other versions and NPCs that will either help or harm Jim if he talks to them.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Jim fights using his trusty cutlass, which swings horizontally while walking or crouching and vertically when Jim is climbing a ladder. There are a few power-ups Jim can acquire also, those the effectiveness tends to vary per version:Fairies: These provide Jim with magical powers, allowing him to fire projectiles from his sword. They can be powered up a total of six times, increasing the power and size of each projectile.Longsword: A powerful sword that can take out enemy projectiles fired at Jim. It is only available in the Arcade version.Boots: These allow Jim to jump higher and walk faster. Like the Longsword, it is a temporary item. In the Arcade version, if a second pair of boots or a second longsword is found while Jim is still equipped with the previous, they become permanent (at least until Jim loses a life).Treasure: Simply adds to the player's score.Keys: Open treasure chests and item shops, where many of the above items can be bought. The player uses their own score for currency in the Arcade version.Potions: A potion will give Jim a second chance if he is hit, saving him from an untimely demise. In the Master System version this bonus remains with Jim until he needs it, though it's only temporary in the Arcade version.Letters: These symbols can be found after defeating enemies and will give the player an extra life if they find all of them, which spells out "Captain Silver".Weapon Upgrades: Unique to the NES version, these upgrades to Jim's attacking power can be bought in stores with money.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Continue[CR]Hold up and hit both buttons before the game resets.

Mouse: Great Mysterious Castle Adventure) is a 2D sidescrolling platformer developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis on November 20, 1990. It is the first in a series of Sega-produced games starring Disney mascot Mickey Mouse (known as the "Illusion" series).[CR]As Mickey, players must embark on an adventure through the evil and mysterious Castle of Illusion to rescue Minnie Mouse from the evil witch Mizrabel, who plans to steal Minnie's youth. To do so, he must find the seven Gems of the Rainbow (guarded by the Masters of Illusion) hidden within the magical worlds (including an enchanted forest and a toy-box) scattered throughout the castle. The game's Practice difficulty changes the goal, in which Mickey must find three gems (collected by completing a particular level from the game's first three worlds) that would make Mizrabel see beauty in herself.[CR]The game was later remade for the Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear in 1990-1991, featuring redesigned levels and simplified graphics (as well as different enemies, items, and bosses), as well as completely changing one of Mickey's attacking mechanics from flinging apples (and other items previously collected) to picking up and hurling larger solid objects found throughout each level (such as indestructible barrels, which double as a puzzle mechanic).[CR]The original game was bundled with QuackShot starring Donald Duck in Japan on October 15, 1998 as part of the Sega Ages series of game collections for the Sega Saturn. It also received a full remake on September 3, 2013 (almost 23 years after the original game's release) as a downloadable title for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC by Sega Studios Australia (under supervision of the original game's director, Emiko Yamamoto) featuring a variety of new gameplay mechanics (such as transitioning between 2D and 3D platforming) and a spoken narrator.

To attack enemies, Mickey can stomp on them, or fling apples and marbles at them, which can be collected throughout the game.

It was one of the last Sega Master System games ever released in Japan. Chou-On Senshi Borgman is actually an anime TV show about a trio of young heroes attempting to prevent an invasion of Earth from alien forces, using their high-tech cyber armor and weaponry. It is an example of the sci-fi tokusatsu genre, much like Power Rangers or Ultraman.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game superficially resembles something like Metroid, where there is a map and the player must explore the level and find the right item to proceed to the end. However, each stage is relatively linear and future areas can only be explored once the player has done everything they need to in the previous. The game has a couple of odd GUI elements - at the top left of the screen is a virtual view of the corridor ahead of the main character, from their perspective. Items and objects will appear here before they appear on the main action screen below, and will give the player an noisy indication that one of the area's bosses is in range. To the top right is the map screen, which gives the player an approximation of where they are.[CR]The game is notable for its odd control issues. In order to use the elevators, the player must be standing in the correct location before pressing up, as pressing up will also activate a bomb in the player's inventory which are vital and limited in number. Once in the elevator, the player must head to the right and use the keypad (visible in the "first-person view" at the top left of the screen) and select the floor manually with the up and down buttons. If the player wants to access their inventory, they must press a button on the second controller to do so.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Reappearing Items[CR]You must be near an elevator for this to work.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Reappearing Items[CR]Collect the item, then enter the elevator.

The game has a couple of odd GUI elements - at the top left of the screen is a virtual view of the corridor ahead of the main character, from their perspective. Items and objects will appear here before they appear on the main action screen below, and will give the player an noisy indication that one of the area's bosses is in range. To the top right is the map screen, which gives the player an approximation of where they are.[CR]The game is notable for its odd control issues. In order to use the elevators, the player must be standing in the correct location before pressing up, as pressing up will also activate a bomb in the player's inventory which are vital and limited in number. Once in the elevator, the player must head to the right and use the keypad (visible in the "first-person view" at the top left of the screen) and select the floor manually with the up and down buttons. If the player wants to access their inventory, they must press a button on the second controller to do so.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Reappearing Items[CR]You must be near an elevator for this to work.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Reappearing Items[CR]Collect the item, then enter the elevator. Without changing floors, get out of the elevator. The item will be back.</plot>				<releasedate>1/12/1988</releasedate>				<year>1988</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>				<videoid>cv6OeSV89OQ</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2722</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588052-cyborg-hunter</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/chonsenshi-borgman</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/cyborg-hunter/3030-20088/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2375581-cyborg_hunter_sms_us.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2722-1.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/185314-choonsenshi-borgman-sega-master-system-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/185315-choonsenshi-borgman-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/185316-choonsenshi-borgman-sega-master-system-screenshot-entered.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/185317-choonsenshi-borgman-sega-master-system-screenshot-miki-gives.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/185319-choonsenshi-borgman-sega-master-system-screenshot-entering.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/185320-choonsenshi-borgman-sega-master-system-screenshot-found-a.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/185321-choonsenshi-borgman-sega-master-system-screenshot-one-of-the.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/185323-choonsenshi-borgman-sega-master-system-screenshot-entered.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/185324-choonsenshi-borgman-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-smaller.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/185325-choonsenshi-borgman-sega-master-system-screenshot-same-running.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Chuck Rock (Europe)">				<description>Chuck Rock (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FChuck%20Rock%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="203448" />				<title_clean>Chuck Rock</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Chuck Rock is a prehistoric-themed platformer starring the eponymous caveman Chuck on a quest to rescue his wife from a jealous rival. Chuck's main form of attack is a stomach bump with a limited range, but he is also able to take advantage of rocks littering the stages to attack enemies from afar. He can also use these rocks to create platforms to higher areas he cannot reach by jumping normally. While most dinosaurs are hostile some, like the wading brachiosaurs and certain pteranodons, will assist Chuck by taking him to new areas of the stage.[CR]UK developers Core Design originally created Chuck Rock for the Atari ST and Amiga computer platforms, and it was subsequently published on many home consoles of the era by Sony Imagesoft and Virgin Interactive in Europe and the US. It is perhaps best remembered for its rock n' roll theme tune. It was followed up with a direct sequel starring Chuck's son Chuck Jr., called Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck, and BC Racers, a spin-off cart racer game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]When turning on the console press and hold Down + Right + 1 on controller 1, and Down on controller 2. You will now be invincible, and you can skip the current level by pressing 2 on controller 2.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1992</releasedate>				<year>1992</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>Virgin Games, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.0</rating>				<videoid>Ng0HxM93FPw</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>11762</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570262-chuck-rock</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/chuck-rock</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/chuck-rock/3030-2941/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/7404</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11762-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/55785-chuck-rock-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164674-chuck-rock-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/133995-chuck-rock-sega-master-system-screenshot-splash-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/133996-chuck-rock-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/133997-chuck-rock-sega-master-system-screenshot-chuck-jumps-high.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/133998-chuck-rock-sega-master-system-screenshot-carrying-a-boulder.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/133999-chuck-rock-sega-master-system-screenshot-let-s-travel-the.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134000-chuck-rock-sega-master-system-screenshot-crossing-the-sea.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134001-chuck-rock-sega-master-system-screenshot-level-2.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134002-chuck-rock-sega-master-system-screenshot-chuck-is-carried.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/133994-chuck-rock-sega-master-system-screenshot-game-over.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2614717-chuckrock001.jpg</snapshot10>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/ohhhoyx.png</banner1>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11762.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Chuck Rock II - Son of Chuck (Brazil)">				<description>Chuck Rock II - Son of Chuck (Brazil)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FChuck%20Rock%20II%20-%20Son%20of%20Chuck%20%28Brazil%29.zip" size="255426" />				<title_clean>Chuck Rock II - Son of Chuck</title_clean>				<plot>The story in this Chuck Rock game takes up a little while after the end of the first game.

However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.

It is the second game to star Spot, the tiny anthropomorphic red dot and then-mascot of the 7 Up brand of soft drinks. As one of the many Spots, players must guide it around the world, rescuing other Spots from their unexplained imprisonment in cages.[CR]The game was later released in 1995 for the Sega Game Gear, Game Boy, Sega Master System (Europe only), Amiga (Europe only), and PC (Europe only). It later received a sequel, titled Spot Goes To Hollywood, for Genesis, Saturn, and PlayStation.[CR]While the game was a licensed promotion with the soft drink, European versions removed the branding (since the European version of 7 Up did not have Spot as its mascot).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Spot can jump and attack by firing soda bubbles which can be shot in all directions and while jumping. Cool Spot can also cling to and climb on various things.[CR]In each level, the player must rescue other cool spots, who look exactly alike, from cages at the end of that level. The end of the level is not necessarily the point at the far right of the level map. In order to do so, the player is required to collect a certain number of "spots" that change (usually increase) as the game progresses. "Spots" are placed across the level in large quantities, and are the game's substitute for items such as Sonic the Hedgehog's gold rings (these were often used in this style of game, mostly for points). A player's health is monitored by a humorous Cool Spot face that gradually bends forward and will eventually fall from its position as damage occurs. Damage is taken by touching enemies, their projectiles, or certain level obstacles. Each level is played with a time limit. If the clock hits zero, a life is lost regardless of the player's health.[CR]The game has no save feature but does use checkpoints in the form of flagpoles. Once passed, the flag raises and a trumpet sounds. If a player loses a life after reaching a checkpoint, the player can restart further in the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]Enter the code while highlighting 'Music' in the 'Options' menu.  'Cheats!' will appear at the bottom of the list  in here, you can turn on infinite lives (Lives) and invincibility (Shield), and choose your starting level (Level).</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1993</releasedate>				<year>1993</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>Virgin Games, Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.2</rating>				<videoid>cm6x7GPcTQ0</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3087</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588051-cool-spot</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/cool-spot</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/cool-spot/3030-11746/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8264</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3087-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3087-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164756-cool-spot-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68055-cool-spot-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68056-cool-spot-sega-master-system-screenshot-instructions.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68057-cool-spot-sega-master-system-screenshot-beginning-level-1.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68058-cool-spot-sega-master-system-screenshot-collect-the-red-cool.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68059-cool-spot-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-clam-enemy.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68060-cool-spot-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-crab-enemy.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68061-cool-spot-sega-master-system-screenshot-fire-bubbles-at-enemies.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68062-cool-spot-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-deck-chair.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68063-cool-spot-sega-master-system-screenshot-jump-from-balloon-to.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/68064-cool-spot-sega-master-system-screenshot-use-the-bubble-to-jump.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3087-1.jpg</fanart1>				<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/3087-g.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Cosmic Spacehead (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es)">				<description>Cosmic Spacehead (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FCosmic%20Spacehead%20%28Europe%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%29.zip" size="198766" />				<title_clean>Cosmic Spacehead</title_clean>				<plot>Linus had crash landed on a distant planet called Earth, and made his way back home again. Trouble is, no one believes his tale of the planet he discovered! Your job is to help Linus make his way back to planet Earth so he can take some pictures to convince his friends. Gameplay consists of two parts, an adventure and arcade action. In adventure mode you can explore lands, find objects, and talk to people. Sentences can be constructed by using the pointer to select actions or objects on the screen (This is similar to the interface LucasArts used in games such as Maniac Mansion.) To reach many new locations involves the action mode, where you will need to cross treacherous landscapes and evade dangerous creatures. This portion resembles a side scrolling platform game. Once you've cleared an action sequence, you will not need to do so again if you decide to revisit a location.

It was one of the last Sega Master System games ever released in Japan. Chou-On Senshi Borgman is actually an anime TV show about a trio of young heroes attempting to prevent an invasion of Earth from alien forces, using their high-tech cyber armor and weaponry. It is an example of the sci-fi tokusatsu genre, much like Power Rangers or Ultraman.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game superficially resembles something like Metroid, where there is a map and the player must explore the level and find the right item to proceed to the end. However, each stage is relatively linear and future areas can only be explored once the player has done everything they need to in the previous. The game has a couple of odd GUI elements - at the top left of the screen is a virtual view of the corridor ahead of the main character, from their perspective. Items and objects will appear here before they appear on the main action screen below, and will give the player an noisy indication that one of the area's bosses is in range. To the top right is the map screen, which gives the player an approximation of where they are.[CR]The game is notable for its odd control issues. In order to use the elevators, the player must be standing in the correct location before pressing up, as pressing up will also activate a bomb in the player's inventory which are vital and limited in number. Once in the elevator, the player must head to the right and use the keypad (visible in the "first-person view" at the top left of the screen) and select the floor manually with the up and down buttons. If the player wants to access their inventory, they must press a button on the second controller to do so.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Reappearing Items[CR]You must be near an elevator for this to work.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Reappearing Items[CR]Collect the item, then enter the elevator. Without changing floors, get out of the elevator. The item will be back.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1988</releasedate>				<year>1988</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA Corporation</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>4.0</rating>				<videoid>cv6OeSV89OQ</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2722</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588052-cyborg-hunter</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/cyborg-hunter</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/cyborg-hunter/3030-20088/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2722-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2722-1.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/73097-cyborg-hunter-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/73098-cyborg-hunter-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-main-hallway.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/73099-cyborg-hunter-sega-master-system-screenshot-some-dialogue.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/73100-cyborg-hunter-sega-master-system-screenshot-one-of-the-lower.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/73101-cyborg-hunter-sega-master-system-screenshot-chief-cyborg-in.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/73102-cyborg-hunter-sega-master-system-screenshot-inside-the-elevator.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/73103-cyborg-hunter-sega-master-system-screenshot-paladin-punches.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/73104-cyborg-hunter-sega-master-system-screenshot-area-b.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/73105-cyborg-hunter-sega-master-system-screenshot-ussing-the-psycho.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/73106-cyborg-hunter-sega-master-system-screenshot-chief-cyborg-in.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Cyborg Z (Korea)">				<description>Cyborg Z (Korea)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FCyborg%20Z%20%28Korea%29.zip" size="83983" />				<title_clean>Cyborg Z</title_clean>				<plot>Cyborg Z is an Action game, developed and published by Zemina,which was released in Korea in 1991.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]Enter at the Play Select Screen</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1991</releasedate>				<year>1991</year>				<genre>Action, Shooter, Scrolling</genre>				<studio>Zemina</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/685542-cyborg-z</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/cyborg-z</mobygames_url>				<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/6/3/8/246638_front.jpg</boxart1>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/566700-cyborg-z-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/566701-cyborg-z-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-game-selects-the.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/566702-cyborg-z-sega-master-system-screenshot-getting-started.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/566703-cyborg-z-sega-master-system-screenshot-new-weapon-acquired.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/566704-cyborg-z-sega-master-system-screenshot-green-triangular-shot.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/566705-cyborg-z-sega-master-system-screenshot-populated-area.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/566706-cyborg-z-sega-master-system-screenshot-high-scores.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/566707-cyborg-z-sega-master-system-screenshot-two-player-mode.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/566708-cyborg-z-sega-master-system-screenshot-egyptian-style-environments.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/d/c/gfs_282079_2_1.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="C_So!

The Jungle Fighter</title_clean>				<plot>Long ago, in the distant land of Moralos, in a time when vast jungles still covered the Earth, an evil presence emerged from its tomb beneath the ground. His name was Gilbas, and he was about to destroy the inhabitants of the land. Aganan, a great warrior, was summoned to save the troubled land and put an end to Gilbas by sealing him in the tome from where it came.[CR]Unfortunately, Gilba was successfully resurrected and another warrior, Danan, was called. His quest is to locate the three sacred objects that Aganan used to defeat Gilbas: "The Orb of Light", "The Amulet of Light", and "The Knife of Light". [CR]There are about four rounds to complete, and has Danan going through exotic locations defeating enemies such as valkyries, ogres, bees, spiders, and several others. At the end of each round, you come face to face with a boss, which takes quite a number of hits to kill with your sword. Once they are defeated, they are likely to give you one of the objects that you need to defeat Gilbas. More to the story is then revealed.[CR]Assisting you with your journey are three animals: an eagle, a monkey, and some other animal that I am unfamiliar with. To get these animals to help you, however, you will need to collect three of their tokens that are found in yellow chests. These animals are quite useful in dangerous situations. The eagle, for example, can get a hold of you and fly you to safety if more than one type of enemy surrounds you. Anyway, you can get these animals to help you at any place, at any time, as long as you have three of its tokens. Yellow chests can also reveal extra strength, extra time, or extra health.[CR]The game ends when you run out of time, or when you lose your health, and there are no second chances, unless you manage to find some elixirs, which are rare.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>				<year>1990</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA Corporation</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.2</rating>				<videoid>jluyTaO2JmA</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2726</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570204-danan-the-jungle-fighter</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/danan-the-jungle-fighter</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/danan-the-jungle-fighter/3030-3139/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8815</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2726-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2726-1.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70903-danan-the-jungle-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70904-danan-the-jungle-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-round.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70905-danan-the-jungle-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-danan.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70906-danan-the-jungle-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-some.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70907-danan-the-jungle-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-get.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70908-danan-the-jungle-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-danan.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70909-danan-the-jungle-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-you.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70910-danan-the-jungle-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-i-hate.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70911-danan-the-jungle-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-looking.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/70912-danan-the-jungle-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-first.jpg</snapshot10>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/Xv6bUmW.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Dead Angle (USA, Europe)">				<description>Dead Angle (USA, Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FDead%20Angle%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" size="111254" />				<title_clean>Dead Angle</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dead Angle is an on-rails shooter set in the 1930s that was released in 1988 in the Arcades and ported to the Sega Master System in 1989.

It features the exploits of the private detective George Phoenix as he attempts to shut down a criminal empire and rescue his girlfriend.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is essentially a rail shooter in which players control both the cross-hair to aim, and the detective simultaneously. Controlling the character, albeit without controlling the game's movement, makes this game straddle the line between a rail shooter and third-person shooter.[CR]The game progresses through several stages. Once a set quota of enemies have been killed a boss will appear before moving on to the next stage.[CR]The Master System port has fewer levels than the arcade version and also has fewer mechanics. In the arcade version the player could throw grenades at enemies, however this wasn't present in the Master System version.[CR]Despite being a rail shooter, the game doesn't support the light phaser.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Hard Difficulty Setting[CR]On the Main Menu, use Controller 2 to change the difficulty.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]Keep pressing left, right on control pads 1 and 2 until a  sound plays.

While released around the time of the 1990 Dick Tracy movie and heavily inspired by its look and setting, the game does not follow the movie's plot, instead telling an unrelated story about Tracy tracking down a suspicious nitroglycerin shipment.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Receiving word that Big Boy's gang is up to something at the train yard, Tracy arrives just in time to see them getting on a train carrying a shipment of nitroglycerin. Concerned, he tracks the shipment to a warehouse, only to see The Brow speed away with it. The Brow leads him to Lips Manlis, who reveals Big Boy has a secret explosives factory going, using the TNT produced to take out the competition.[CR]Hitting the streets for information on the factory, Tracy corners Shoulders who points him back to the warehouse. Tracy returns to investigate, however Big Boy's hitman Flattop awaits him there, to lure him into a trap. The trap fails, and Tracy manages to get the defeated henchman to give up his bosses' location. Now hot on Big Boy's trail, Tracy tracks him through the sewer, leading to the harbor, before a final confrontation in the nearby drawbridge gearhouse.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is a side-scrolling shooter with occasional light platforming. To progress to the next scene, Tracy must get to the right end, avoiding or defeating the suit-clad mobsters who constantly pop out of doorways, behind objects, or the edge of the screen, going after Tracy with fists, knives, guns or explosives. Tracy himself is armed with a revolver and a tommy gun, the former for enemies at his front or back, while the latter fires stream of bullets used to take out enemies hiding in the background. His guns have unlimited ammunition, but Tracy will punch instead of shoot if enemies enter brawling range, gaining a "punch bonus" for each enemy defeated that way.[CR]Tracy has 4 to 8 health segments, depending on difficulty chosen, 2 lives, and 3 to 5 continue credits selectable from the options. As there are no items in the game, Tracy only regains health between scenes, but shooting gallery bonus levels between each stage allow Tracy to earn extra points and credits by hitting crooks while leaving cops and civilians unharmed. Most scenes have time limits between 3 and 4 minutes, and must be completed within that time or Tracy loses a life.[CR]Some scenes change the rules somewhat:Unarmed scenes strip Tracy of his guns, usually for flimsy story reasons. Because he does not have the tommy gun, they do not feature the enemy filled extended backgrounds, instead adding a bit of verticality with ladders and paths higher up on the screen.Vehicle scenes are fixed scrolling survival scenarios, where Tracy hangs on the outside of a police car, dodging incoming fire and shooting back at enemy cars, trying to stay alive for a set amount of time until he reaches the destination.Boss scenes play much like regular ones, except the stage boss is running around in the background, constantly attacking Tracy, and the scene doesn't end until the boss's health bar is depleted.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The game consists of 6 stages, each divided into 3 scenes.StageSceneNameType1ATracy Gets a Leadregular1BSteve's Train Yardunarmed1CThe Wrong Side of the Tracksboss: Itchy2ADestination - 7th St. Warehouseregular2BThe Chase!vehicle2CA Browbeating Under the Elboss: The Brow3AHitting the Streetsregular3BRacing Down First Streetvehicle3CDrinks Are on the Houseboss: Lips Manlis4AA Hold Up in the Back Alley!unarmed4BBack to the Warehouse!regular4CAn Explosive Confrontation!boss: Pruneface5ASearching the Warehouseregular5BA New Lead?vehicle5CTracy Falls into a Trap!boss: Flattop6AAfter a Rat!unarmed6BHarboring a Fugitive!regular6CShowdown at the Gearhouse!boss: Big Boy[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>				<year>1990</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>2.3</rating>				<videoid>n2f0BXP5a2E</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3088</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588054-dick-tracy</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/dick-tracy_</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/dick-tracy/3030-40441/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8267</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3088-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3088-2.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/73403-dick-tracy-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134336-dick-tracy-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134337-dick-tracy-sega-master-system-screenshot-splash-screen.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134338-dick-tracy-sega-master-system-screenshot-options-screen.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134339-dick-tracy-sega-master-system-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134340-dick-tracy-sega-master-system-screenshot-level-1-intro.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134341-dick-tracy-sega-master-system-screenshot-level-1-on-the-road.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134343-dick-tracy-sega-master-system-screenshot-dick-is-dead.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134344-dick-tracy-sega-master-system-screenshot-dick-once-again-on.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134345-dick-tracy-sega-master-system-screenshot-game-over.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/3909/362026-10.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3088-1.jpg</fanart1>				<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3088-2.jpg</fanart2>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/3088.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Dinobasher Starring Bignose the Caveman (Europe) (Proto)">				<description>Dinobasher Starring Bignose the Caveman (Europe) (Proto)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FDinobasher%20Starring%20Bignose%20the%20Caveman%20%28Europe%29%20%28Proto%29.zip" size="140298" />				<title_clean>Dinobasher Starring Bignose the Caveman</title_clean>				<plot>Unreleased game, developped by Optimus Software for Codemasters in 1993/1994.

The game was first developed by Technos Japan Corporation and published by Taito Corporation, and has since been ported to numerous consoles, computers, handhelds, and even cellular phones. The game also spawned the popular Double Dragon franchise, which has had five games in the main franchise, as well as two Neo-Geo fighting games.[CR]After the initial arcade release, the game has been ported to a variety of systems, including the Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Master System, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 (two different versions), PC, Atari ST, Amiga, Atari 2600, Atari 7800, Game Boy, Sega Genesis, Atari Lynx, Xbox Live Arcade, Zeebo, iPhone and Android. Every release differs in some aspect or another, particularly the Game Gear, NES, Game Boy, and Atari 2600 versions.[CR]The game's popularity led to several sequels (with the latest iteration released in 2003), a cartoon series (which ran for two seasons), a comic book (published by Marvel, ran for six issues), and even a movie (which was released in 1994, inspired by the television cartoon). The cartoon and its resulting movie release were both loosely based on the NES version of the game, whereas Jimmy Lee is initially a villain (having been raised by the antagonist of the franchise, the Shadow Master).[CR]The game's soundtrack was composed by Kazunaka Yamane, and was released in an album on February 21, 1988. The soundtrack, titled Original Sound of Double Dragon, features all nine tracks from the arcade version of the game. These tracks are all arranged versions of the songs found in the game.Gameplay[CR]Double Dragon follows Billy Lee and Jimmy Lee (incorrectly named Hammer and Spike in the promotional materials with the American version of the arcade game), two martial artists whose love interest, Marian, is kidnapped by a gang called the Black Warriors. Playing in cooperative mode triggers a different ending, where Billy and Jimmy must fight each other for the affection of Marian.The Black Warriors kidnapping Marian in the Arcade version[CR]A three button beat-em-up, there are three base moves in Double Dragon; punching, kicking, and jumping. Various combinations of these moves produce other moves, such as head butts, elbow smashes, jumping kicks, backwards kicks, or the signature Double Dragon hair grab (in which the character grabs the enemy by the hair, making them vulnerable to attacks and throws).[CR]In addition to moves, Double Dragon has a variety of weapons that can be carried from fight to fight (this was altered in the NES version, where weapons could only be used if the enemy it was taken from is still alive). There are four weapons; baseball bats, whips (neither of which are incredibly effective), knives (which are arguably the most powerful weapons in the game), and explosives (timed explosives which can be thrown).[CR]Other Versions[CR]NES VersionOnly two enemies can be on-screen simultaneously in NES version[CR]Released in 1988 (and later on the Wii Virtual Console in 2008), the NES version of Double Dragon was among the better received ports of the game. Published by Tradewest, Double Dragon on the NES has many differences from the arcade game on which it is based, beyond the obvious decrease in graphical and sound quality. The plot was altered, due to the exclusion of a two-player cooperative mode. Rather than fighting the leader of the Shadow Warriors, Billy Lee faces off against his brother, Jimmy Lee.[CR]Other than the single player story, there are a few other modes that implement two player gameplay. Mode A allows players to do a tag-team style game, alternating who is playing after each death. Mode B is a one-on-one tournament fighting game, where players can choose to fight either computer controlled opponents or player controlled characters.The two player fighting mode in NES version[CR]The game also implemented an upgrade system, where players earn hearts for dispatching certain amounts of enemies. These hearts upgrade the character's abilities, allowing for more complicated moves such as backwards elbowing and face punching. In addition to moves, there are a variety of weapons available, ranging from baseball bats to whips (as well as ranging in damage dealt, and subsequently usefulness).[CR]There are many other differences found in the NES version, some due to general technical limitations. For example, only two enemies can be onscreen simultaneously due to the NES's abilities. Naturally, the stage design deviates from what was found in the original arcade version, including new areas, expanded sections, and completely new levels.Master System VersionSega Master System home console port of Double Dragon[CR]After the NES version was released, Sega brought the game to their 8-bit platform as well. Due to the Sega Master System's more powerful hardware, the Master System version has better graphics (with more colors), more enemies on-screen, and modes and levels that are very similar to the arcade version.[CR]Unlike the NES version of Double Dragon, the Sega Master System version retains the two-player cooperative mode found in the original arcade version. Although it doesn't include the head-to-head versus mode found in the NES game, Double Dragon on the Sega Master System does have one other feature not found in the NES or arcade versions; an unlimited amount of continues (except for the final level).Mega Drive/Genesis Version[CR]In 1992, Double Dragon was ported to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. This game was developed by Ballistic, and is very similar to the arcade release. Double Dragon on the Sega Genesis was criticized for one key aspect; its control. The game, according to fans and critics, makes it incredibly difficult to hit enemies, with small hit boxes and sloppy movement.Handheld VersionsThe Game Gear version only features Billy Lee as a playable character[CR]The game has had three different handheld ports; Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, and Atari Lynx. The first of these three versions was released in 1990. The Game Boy version of Double Dragon is heavily influenced by the NES game, with similar level design, enemies, and overall graphical style.[CR]The Game Boy version varies on one key aspect from the NES Double Dragon; it does not include the heart system found in this game. Every move is accessible from the start. In some areas, portions of stages were removed completely for the Game Boy port, particularly some platforming segments of the final stage. Additionally, every character in the two player fighting mode was removed except for Billy Lee and Jimmy Lee.[CR]On the Game Gear, Double Dragon was significantly different from other versions of the game. Subtitled "The Revenge of Billy Lee" in Europe, this game centers around the murder of Jimmy Lee, and Billy Lee's quest of vengeance against the Dragon Clan. Other than this, the game was largely a different game, with altered stage design, different weapons (i.e. guns), and the lack of any modes beyond a single player story mode.[CR]With large sprites, the Atari Lynx version is another recreation of the original arcade game. Giving only a small view of the stage, the game was criticized due to the fact that enemy and character sprites take up nearly three fourths of the Lynx's screen size. The Atari Lynx version also includes a practice mode, which allows players to fight a varying amount of enemies to learn the controls and moves of the game.[CR]In 2003 the game received an enhanced remake for the Game Boy Advance in the form of Double Dragon Advance, which added several new features including cutscenes, additional levels, and new moves.Smartphone VersionSmartphone version[CR]In 2011 a smartphone version of Double Dragon was released on both iPhone and Android. Rather than a straight port, this version adds several features, some of which originated in the Game Boy Advance remake. In addition to the Lee brothers, players can unlock 24 playable characters for use in any mode.Other Versions[CR]Like the sequels to Double Dragon, Binary Designs worked on computer ports to create a variety of versions of the game. Additionally, a second Commodore 64 port was created by Ocean Software, and differed in many ways from the previous Commodore 64 port. While all of the games naturally differ from the arcade game on which they are based, there are several relevant details relating to the ports.[CR]The ZX Spectrum version was incredibly different when it came to graphical style. Due to an attempt at the detail of the arcade version, this version had character and enemy sprites which were transparent other than the black outlines. This, combined with an attempt at some detailed color, caused the game to run very slowly.Both of the Atari versions of the game were created by Activision[CR]Both of the Commodore 64 ports were very close in style, attempting to emulate the gameplay of the arcade release (the first even included a two player mode, almost unheard of among the computer ports). A major difference for the first version was a complete lack of sound, other than the sound effects created by punching and kicking. The second version lacked a two player mode, although it is considered by Double Dragon fans to be a slightly better port.[CR]Also released for the Atari 2600 and Atari 7800, these two ports were handled by Activision. The 2600 version of the game naturally cut much of the game's content; with redone sound and graphics to fit the platform's capabilities, removed enemy sprites, cut weapons, and a shorter story mode (although there is still a two player cooperative mode, as well as a two player versus mode). The 7800 version was improved graphically and sound-wise, although it removes the versus mode.SoundtrackOpening (Double Dragon)The City Slums (The Black Warriors Arrive)The Industrial Area (The Great Fray)After the BattleSetting Off (A New Battle)The WoodsThe Giant Abobo AppearsThe Hideout (Willy the Nemesis)Ending (Reunion With Marian)[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Data East's Bad Dudes advertisement.Two Amstrad CPC ports of Double Dragon were created. One for the CPC 6128 hardware, which was very well-received and released almost exclusively in France, and another version created for the CPC 464 which was universally panned.The more well-received version of Double Dragon on the Amstrad CPC actually had more in common with the Atari ST and Amiga versions.An advertising campaign from Data East around the release of Bad Dudes stated that, "Bad Dudes Makes Double Dragon Pale by Comparison."Most versions of Double Dragon are infamous for their glitches and exploits, such as suicidal enemies, weapons that can be carried to future stages, frozen sprites, incorrect graphics, and even walking up walls or in the air.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Lives for the Final Stage[CR]On the beginning screen, do 20-30 Jumping Spin kicks.

The game is also included in several compilations, such as Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for the Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. The Genesis version was not released in Japan until 2000, where a PC port of the title was included in "Sega Archives from USA vol. 2"; the Game Gear version was first available to Japanese audiences in Sonic Adventure DX.[CR]Mean Bean Machine is, in essence, a reskinned version of the original Puyo Puyo. Though a more direct English translation of Puyo Puyo's Game Gear port titled "Puzlow Kids" was developed, the decision was ultimately made to change the game's aesthetics; allegedly, this was due to the belief that Westerners wouldn't accept a game featuring a little girl as the protagonist. The characters from Compile's Madou Monogatari series were replaced with characters from The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, a cartoon series based on the Sonic franchise.[CR]More than a year later, Puyo Puyo's Super Famicom port was reskinned with a Kirby theme and released as Kirby's Avalanche.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Colored beans fall from the top of the screen and must be cleared by connecting four or more beans of the same color. By doing so, the player generates Refugee beans that are sent to the opponent. Refugee beans, once they fall onto the opponent's field, cannot be matched with any other beans; instead, they are removed by clearing an adjacent set of colored beans. The first player that cannot bring more beans into their field loses.[CR]In the game's Scenario mode, the player competes in one-on-one duels with Dr. Robotnik's robot underlings in order to save the bean creatures from being turned into robots. They are faced in the following order:ArmsFranklyHumptyCoconutsDavy SprocketSkweelDynamightGrounderSpikeSir F-Fuzzy LogikDragon BreathScratchDr. Robotnik[CR]Exercise Mode lets players to match beans until they lose, while Vs. Mode allows two players to go head-to-head. The Game Gear version includes Puzzle Mode, which presents the player with several challenges.[CR]Changes from Puyo Puyo[CR]Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine's gameplay is nearly identical to Puyo Puyo, right down to the AI behavior of each opponent. However, Mean Bean Machine removes the Beginner course that was present in Puyo Puyo.

Without relying on a story, the game throws you into a randomly generated world which you should explore carefully - and most importantly, where you must survive! The complex, maze-like levels reveal their structure only after you cover the corresponding map areas. Your goal in each level is to reach a teleporter which will take you to the next one. There are also a lot of random items scattered around - weapons, armor, money, and food. Money allows you to continue the game if you die, food prevents you from starving. The enemies are visible on screen, and you fight them in a fast-paced turn-based combat, moving around and pressing direction arrows to strike with the equipped weapon. You are always accompanied by an egg which will eventually grow up to be a dragon if you have leveled up enough.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>				<year>1991</year>				<genre>RPG</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>				<rating>1.8</rating>				<videoid>X2uuA-3EDeo</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2733</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/575454-dragon-crystal</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/dragon-crystal</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/dragon-crystal/3030-11418/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2733-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/54666-dragon-crystal-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/54678-dragon-crystal-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116575-dragon-crystal-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116572-dragon-crystal-sega-master-system-screenshot-starting-in-a.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116573-dragon-crystal-sega-master-system-screenshot-inventory.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116574-dragon-crystal-sega-master-system-screenshot-proceeding-revealing.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116571-dragon-crystal-sega-master-system-screenshot-oh-wow-lots-of.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116576-dragon-crystal-sega-master-system-screenshot-killed-by-a-scorpion.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/116577-dragon-crystal-sega-master-system-screenshot-mountain-area.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87371/1338168-1086068_21_07_2009_12_43_45_super.png</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87371/1338165-1085652_gameplay_3_super.png</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/8/87371/1338164-1085651_gameplay_1_super.png</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Dynamite Duke (Europe)">				<description>Dynamite Duke (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FDynamite%20Duke%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="93174" />				<title_clean>Dynamite Duke</title_clean>				<plot>[CR]An arcade port on the Genesis, Dynamite Duke has the player assuming the titular role, playing a cybernetically enhanced super-soldier fighting waves of baddies.

The player assumes the role of the eponymous annelid who is able to shoot in multiple directions with his space blaster, with the ultimate goal of saving the galaxy from Queen Slug-for-a-Butt. The game is best known for its surreal sense of humor and fluid animations.[CR]Earthworm Jim premiered in the October of 1994 for multiple platforms. It saw a sequel the subsequent year: Earthworm Jim 2. In 2010, Earthworm Jim received HD rereleases for modern consoles.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Jim was just an ordinary earthworm who, early one morning, was running from some crows when an indestructible, high-tech super suit (created by the evil genius Professor Monkey-for-a-Head) fell onto him from the sky and, by some wonderful coincidence, the opening of the suit landed on him, and in he went, transforming him into the amazing annelid we've all come to love. Then he took out his gun and exploded the crows who had been chasing him.[CR]The suit had been dropped by a space ship that was being attacked by Psy-Crow, an evil henchman for the Evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-Filled, Malformed Slug-for-a-Butt (or Queen Slug-for-a-Butt in short). The suit was originally designed for her to help her take over the galaxy (...though she probably could never fit in it). Psy-Crow comes to earth to look for the suit but only finds the scorch marks made by the impact of the suit and the exploded crows. He radios Queen Slug-for-a-Butt and they talk about their evil plans for her sister, Princess What's-Her-Name (this game likes its hyphens). Unbeknownst to Psy-Crow, Earthworm Jim was hiding and heard everything. Mustering up some new-found courage, Jim decides to embark on a quest to rescue the beautiful princess.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Jim begins his quest to rescue Princess What's-Her-Name in the game's first level, "New Junk City". There, Jim is introduced to concepts that will be seen throughout most of the course of the game. This includes the use of chains, rope, moss, etc. to climb horizontally, attempting to avoid the peril of landing on spikes, and swinging from hook to hook via Jim's head (using his worminess as a whip). Each level has its own unique gameplay elements to cope with as well. This level in particular includes obstacles such as bouncy piles of tires and zip-lines the player has to use to get Jim to his destination.Jim firing his blaster[CR]Jim will almost immediately encounter baddies at the start of the game. His weapons include a little red blaster and his own earthworm body. Either weapon can be used almost at any time, though on occasion one can be more effective than the other (the gun can stun a crow, but it takes a little longer to kill than by just using the whip, which only takes a single lash. However, the crow must be at the right distance or it's ineffective). Jim's blaster has a full automatic fire rate although it's ammo is capped at 5000. Additional ammo can be picked up throughout the level (the little blaster symbols floating around). Should Jim run out of ammo, the blaster will recharge up to one hundred bullets by itself. There are also Mega Blaster bullets that can be found in a few places in every level. Each Mega Blaster upgrade is good for one shot, delivering a large, devastating beam that destroys any lower enemy with one touch.[CR]Though a platforming game at heart, each level has its own special twists to the formula, breaking up the run-and-gun-and-jump model to deliver on such things as riding hamsters or bungee jumping.[CR]Planets[CR]New Junk CIty[CR]Jim starts off his adventure in this junk yard which he must get through to defeat both Billy the Bin and New Junk City's owner, Chuck.Andy Asteroids?[CR]Jim jumps on his Pocket Rocket and races with Psy-Crow to the end of the level, avoiding asteroids along the way.Psy-Crow[CR]A level that the player only has to complete if Jim loses against Psy-Crow in the Andy Asteroids? level, Jim must have a one on one battle with the mad crow himself to continue.What The Heck?[CR]Planet heck is a strange hell-type planet. This is where Evil the Cat lives and where the player must defeat the likes of lawyers and an un-meltable snowman. The player must complete the level while listening to horrifying elevator music.Down the Tubes[CR]Down the Tubes is an underwater level in which Jim must ride giant hamsters, knock over Bob the Killer GoldFish and complete the infamous tube race.Snot a problem[CR]Major Mucus is out to get Jim! Compete with him in a 3 round battle in which Jim and him both bungee jump down to infested waters and fight by swinging into each other and seeing which cord breaks first.Level 5[CR]The 5th level takes place in Professor Monkey for a head's lab. Watch out though, Jim may just lose his suit, make sure to get it back.Who Turned Out The Lights?[CR]A hidden area found in Level 5 which is completely blacked out besides spotlights, the enemies' eyes and doors.For Pete's Sake[CR]Jim has to escort a cute, tiny puppy named Peter through a level that consists of holes, tentacles and meteor showers. Peter is a small cute timid little dog, but when very frightened he becomes a raging monstrous Hulkish beast.Intestinal Distress[CR]The level takes place in the intestines of a strange creature and at the end of the tunnel Jim must face off against Doc Duodenum. The level is missing from the SNES and PC versions of the game.Buttville[CR]It's all come down to this, Jim is nearing the end of his journey! At the end of stage, prepare to face off against the appropriately named The Evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Stinky, Pus-filled, Malformed, Slug-for-a-Butt.[CR]Avatar Awards[CR]The XBLA version has 2 avatar awards to be earned.Earthworm Jim Suit - Complete a bonus level.Earthworm Jim T-Shirt - (Achievement: Bin Collector) Beat Billy the Bin in New Junk City.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Earthworm Jim has an awesome soundtrack which consists of -Banjo RaceSnot a ProblemParty TimeFallingWhat the HeckButtsvilleBass MixJunkitBos AnneildPsy-crowDarkworm RagSubmergedYou're the bestEnd theme[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1996</releasedate>				<year>1997</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>Tec Toy Indstria de Brinquedos S.A.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.5</rating>				<videoid>r4SEU2a1gwM</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2892</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/941828-earthworm-jim</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/earthworm-jim</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/earthworm-jim/3030-11133/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/9263</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2892-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/3948/1030300-941828_92506_back.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/146612-earthworm-jim-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/523072-earthworm-jim-sega-master-system-screenshot-get-ready.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/523076-earthworm-jim-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-junkyard-level.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/523077-earthworm-jim-sega-master-system-screenshot-these-meatballs.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/523078-earthworm-jim-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-cow-does-not.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/523080-earthworm-jim-sega-master-system-screenshot-using-the-repulsion.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/523081-earthworm-jim-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-mid-boss-is.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/523082-earthworm-jim-sega-master-system-screenshot-groovy.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/523083-earthworm-jim-sega-master-system-screenshot-race-against-psy.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/523084-earthworm-jim-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-what-the-heck.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2892-1.jpg</fanart1>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/Nar3Kmg.jpg</banner1>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2892.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Ecco - The Tides of Time (Brazil)">				<description>Ecco - The Tides of Time (Brazil)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FEcco%20-%20The%20Tides%20of%20Time%20%28Brazil%29.zip" size="221294" />				<title_clean>Ecco - The Tides of Time</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ecco: The Tides of Time is a direct follow-up to the 1993 game, Ecco the Dolphin and developed by Novotrade International (now Appaloosa Interactive). The controls of the first game are identical to the second one, as with the difficulty. It includes all new puzzles such as a Scavenger hunt. There are also new powers, one of them includes Ecco changing into different animals such as a jellyfish, a seagull, a shark and a school of fish. With these new additions, many things from the original game came back. The health and air meter are back along with the Glyphs.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story starts off where the last leaves off: The Vortex Queen is back and follows Ecco back to earth to begin a new hive. Ecco lost his powers from the Ast erite and after he encountered a dolphin with long fins named, Trellia, who was his descendant. She took Ecco to her present which was his future.[CR]In Ecco&#8217;s future, Dolphins evolved with telekinetic powers and the power to fly with helium sacks that were on them. The ocean had a mind of its own with &#8216;skyways&#8217; or waterways that floated trough the skies, which connected other parts of water on the earth. Ecco, who was exploring the future, then found the Asterite.[CR]When talking to the Asterite, it told Ecco that something was wrong. When Ecco used the time machine the world split into two. One which was a joyful future with flying dolphins, the other was a lifeless wasteland which was dried up by the vortex. Even though the Asterite was killed by the Vortex Queen not until later it was explained how it was talking to Ecco. It then sent him back to the present.[CR]Ecco pieced the Asterite together by bringing the globes that made up the creature. The last of the globes had been taken by the Vortex to the future; Ecco had to retrieve them before both he and Asterite could defeat the vortex. They both went to the vortex future that was full of bizarre machines and was much like the last levels of Ecco the Dolphin. Eventually Ecco found the Astrite&#8217;s last two globes and went back to the present.[CR]The Asterite was complete again and Ecco got all of his powers back again.[CR]Ecco then fought the Vortex Queen using the song to destroy her. Though she escaped to the Atlantean time machine, the Asterite told Ecco to destroy it; instead he uses it to and disappears in to the Tides of Time.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]To bring up the cheat menu, use Ecco's sonar to access the map screen.

It would later spawn a sequel (Ecco: The Tides of Time), a kid-friendly spin-off (Ecco Jr.), and a 3D reboot (Ecco the Dolphin: Defender of the Future).Along with downscaled ports to the Sega Master System and Game Gear, the game was ported to the Sega CD less than a year later. This version (known in Japan as Ecco the Dolphin CD) features a bonus set of levels and new soundtrack (using Redbook audio), and was later ported to the PC in Japan and North America (both in 1996, featuring new high-resolution sprites). The original game was digitally re-released for the Wii (via Virtual Console on November 27, 2006), Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade on August 15, 2007), PC (via Steam on June 1, 2010), and most iOS devices (on July 22, 2010), and was included in two compilations: Sega Genesis Collection (for the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable), and Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection (for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3).An enhanced port was made for the Nintendo 3DS (as 3D Ecco the Dolphin, part of Sega's 3D Classics remake series) and digitally released on the 3DS eShop on December 12, 2013 (June 26, 2013 in Japan). This version features stereoscopic 3D and a significantly-easier difficulty setting (adding invulnerability and unlimited air).[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Debug Mode[CR]Go to the first level then use your sonar to enter the level map by holding 1.

There are two modes of play available: "Arcade", "Grand Prix". In both of these modes you complete a certain number of laps (4, 8, or 12) and select which circuit that you want to race on. The circuits include San Marino, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Japan, and Australia. Some circuits are easy, while some are difficult.[CR]There are slight differences between the two modes. For instance, "Arcade" allows you to select the circuit in any order that you like, whereas "Grand Prix" only allows you to fine-tune your car before starting a race. You also need to race a circuit in the order that they appear on the circuit selection screen, but you can skip a track if you want.[CR]F1 is a 1-2 player game, meaning that if you have another player handy, you can compete against each other.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/formula-one_[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1993</releasedate>				<year>1993</year>				<genre>Driving, Racing</genre>				<studio>Domark</studio>				<nplayers>1 - 2</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>2.8</rating>				<videoid>OTWEYa7xjqw</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2739</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570256-f1</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/formula-one_</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/f1/3030-3725/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2739-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/56055-formula-one-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94179-formula-one-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94180-formula-one-sega-master-system-screenshot-name-entry.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94181-formula-one-sega-master-system-screenshot-select-circuit.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94182-formula-one-sega-master-system-screenshot-this-screen-allows.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94183-formula-one-sega-master-system-screenshot-ready-set-go.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94184-formula-one-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-arrows-are-trying.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94185-formula-one-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-results.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94186-formula-one-sega-master-system-screenshot-portugese-circuit.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94187-formula-one-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-french-flag-is.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/94188-formula-one-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-british-circuit.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2739-1.jpg</fanart1>			</game>			<game name="FA Tetris (Korea) (Pirate)">				<description>FA Tetris (Korea) (Pirate)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FFA%20Tetris%20%28Korea%29%20%28Pirate%29.zip" size="21681" />				<title_clean>FA Tetris</title_clean>				<plot>FA Tetris is a Miscellaneous game, developed by Fresh Fishes and published by FA Soft,which was released in Korea in 1990.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>				<genre>Miscellaneous, Puzzle, Stacking</genre>				<studio>Fresh Fishes</studio>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/703174-fa-tetris</gamefaqs_url>				<boxart1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/7/9/2/268792_front.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/7/9/2/268792_back.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/6/a/gfs_304189_2_1.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/b/a/gfs_304189_2_2.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/0/a/gfs_304189_2_3.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/1/a/gfs_304189_2_4.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/a/a/gfs_304189_2_5.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/7/a/gfs_304189_2_6.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/c/a/gfs_304189_2_7.jpg</snapshot7>			</game>			<game name="Family Games (Japan)">				<description>Family Games (Japan)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FFamily%20Games%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="81591" />				<title_clean>Family Games</title_clean>				<plot>Choose from the exciting challenges and action of Billiards, Darts or World Bingo!

Upgrades are bought from shops appearing in the world as red balloons with the word shop on them. All the power-ups are temporary, but are powerful enough to be of considerable help when clearing the larger enemies needed to progress to the stage's boss.[CR]Fantasy Zone was originally an Arcade game but was ported to several consoles, not just those made by Sega. The gameplay was mostly the same in all versions, but the graphic quality varied depending on the platform.[CR]The 1986 Sega Master System version is the first SMS game to be released in the standard cartridge format, rather than the Super Card format the system had used up until that point. The cartridge allowed for a lot more memory, and Fantasy Zone was able to exploit this feature.

You see, the gameplay now involves you going around mazes, collecting all the dots while avoiding enemies. You are awarded points for each dot collected, but they vary depending on their size. For example, small dots award ten points each, while you get 200 points for each larger dot you collect. Once you have collected all the dots in the maze, the enemies will turn into coins, which you must quickly get in a strict time limit and you move on to the next maze. Just before this, though, you get a statistics screen that shows the amount of time that you spent in the maze. Points are also awarded, but sadly, if you spent over sixty seconds in a maze, you won't get any.[CR]Every world you travel to consist of three mazes, and after you complete all three, a bonus round appears where the object is to collect all coins before time expires. While you are collecting the dots in the normal mazes, you must touch the enemy's energy, a flashing red spot within each maze to avoid 2nd-generation enemies from entering the mazes. Some power-ups can be collected, which consist of weapons and speed boosters (big wings), which can be collected by landing on the circle which it is in. However, you need money in form of the amount outlined just before each maze. If you land on a circle while you are short of cash, a 'NO SELLING' sign will appear above it, and you have to collect some more dots and try again. [CR]Also you can die by touching an enemy. When you die, a coin will take you place, and when you get resurrected, you can grab the coin. The game can be played with two players, but the same rule applies in a 2-player game.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1988</releasedate>				<year>1987</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.6</rating>				<videoid>jnDuJUeHU_0</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2742</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588063-fantasy-zone-the-maze</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/fantasy-zone-the-maze</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/fantasy-zone-the-maze/3030-271/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8330</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2742-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2742-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/96614-fantasy-zone-the-maze-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/202102-fantasy-zone-the-maze-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/301773-fantasy-zone-the-maze-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart5>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71396-fantasy-zone-the-maze-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/183626-fantasy-zone-the-maze-sega-master-system-screenshot-japanese.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71397-fantasy-zone-the-maze-sega-master-system-screenshot-select.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71398-fantasy-zone-the-maze-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-power.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71399-fantasy-zone-the-maze-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-plaleaf.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71400-fantasy-zone-the-maze-sega-master-system-screenshot-touch-the.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71401-fantasy-zone-the-maze-sega-master-system-screenshot-get-the.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71402-fantasy-zone-the-maze-sega-master-system-screenshot-statistics.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71405-fantasy-zone-the-maze-sega-master-system-screenshot-flying.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71404-fantasy-zone-the-maze-sega-master-system-screenshot-another.jpg</snapshot10>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/RY1MJ5A.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Fantasy Zone II - Opa-Opa no Namida (Japan)">				<description>Fantasy Zone II - Opa-Opa no Namida (Japan)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FFantasy%20Zone%20II%20-%20Opa-Opa%20no%20Namida%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="162207" />				<title_clean>Fantasy Zone II - Opa-Opa no Namida</title_clean>				<plot>Opa-Opa is at it again in this zany return to his original homeland some ten years later.

The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.[CR]Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Codes discovered by winning Tournament mode[CR]These codes can be typed in at the password menu (the restore option at the main menu).

In arcades, the game was released in three cabinet variants; a standard standup version, a sit-down version and the custom sitdown R-360 cabinet. The R-360 was able to rotate freely on two axes, allowing the cabinet to mimic in-game action, including turning the cabinet completely upside down. Due to the impressiveness of the R-360 cabinet the home computer versions (Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC, ZX Spectrum and Amiga) were named G-LOC R360.[CR]Some ports of the game included features not present in the arcade version. For instance the Mega Drive / Genesis version alternates between first and third-person perspectives, the Master System port features bosses and the Game Gear port allows the player to spend points earned while playing to upgrade the jet.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls an experimental aircraft in timed missions - the player earns more time and advances stages by achieving goals that are set in each stage. During the course of the game the player is attacked from both the front and the back by enemy aircraft. The player controls the aircraft with a joystick and has two weapons: a cannon and missiles. The player can either try to gun down enemy planes or attempt to gain missile lock by moving the crosshair over them. The game is played mostly from a first person perspective, however once locked on to by an enemy the perspective changes to third person (behind the player's aircraft) to allow for evasive manoeuvers.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Michael Jackson owned an R-360 deluxe cabinet of this game. It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24, 2009.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat menu[CR]At the title screen, press 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2 on gamepad two.

Each character has a normal shot and a special weapon. The special weapons vary; because of the altitude, range, pattern, and angles they shoot at. The characters also have different speeds they move at.[CR]There are a total of fifty levels, split into five rounds, each containing 10 stages; all have a boss at the end. There are two ways to complete a level; players can either kill all the enemies or run each characters to the exit zone, though not all stages have an exit. When a character is hit, they are captured and stay at the spot where it happened.

Each character has a normal shot and a special weapon. The special weapons vary; because of the altitude, range, pattern, and angles they shoot at. The characters also have different speeds they move at.[CR]There are a total of fifty levels, split into five rounds, each containing 10 stages; all have a boss at the end. There are two ways to complete a level; players can either kill all the enemies or run each characters to the exit zone, though not all stages have an exit. When a character is hit, they are captured and stay at the spot where it happened. That character can be rescued and taken to the exit, where they will be playable again.[CR]PC System Requirements[CR]MinimumOS: Windows&#174; XP or higherGraphics: 32MB or greater graphics cardDirectX&#174;: DirectX&#174; 9.0 or greaterHard Drive: 50MB free disc space[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All characters and level select aka Special Mode[CR]When starting up your Master System hold down UP and both 1 and 2 on the controller(s) that will be used to play the game until a screen saying Special Mode appears on the screen (after the title screen dissappears).

The goal of the game is to defend the centrally located (and anthropomorphized) planet from a series of alien spacecraft and asteroids. If the planet is hit too many times, the game ends. Each level features a different planet from the Solar System, each with their own characteristics - for instance, Jupiter has a gray mustache.[CR]Opa Opa is controlled with a special paddle controller and is fixed in Earth orbit. This creates a defensive Pong-type situation present in games like Atari's Warlords. As with Warlords, the player cannot let anything slip past them too many times.[CR]While shooting down enemies, the planet's panicked facial expressions will provide hints as to where the next enemy will appear from.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1988</releasedate>				<year>1988</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Alt</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.6</rating>				<videoid>mAks-iZ9loA</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2752</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570167-galactic-protector</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/galactic-protector</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/galactic-protector/3030-11263/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2752-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/259356-galactic-protector-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/259358-galactic-protector-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/92701-galactic-protector-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/92702-galactic-protector-sega-master-system-screenshot-round-1.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/92703-galactic-protector-sega-master-system-screenshot-first-set.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/92704-galactic-protector-sega-master-system-screenshot-two-blue-spheres.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/92705-galactic-protector-sega-master-system-screenshot-congratulations.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/92706-galactic-protector-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-planet.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/92707-galactic-protector-sega-master-system-screenshot-round-2.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/92708-galactic-protector-sega-master-system-screenshot-and-another.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/92709-galactic-protector-sega-master-system-screenshot-round-3.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/92710-galactic-protector-sega-master-system-screenshot-four-asteroids.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Galaxy Force (Europe)">				<description>Galaxy Force (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FGalaxy%20Force%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="258701" />				<title_clean>Galaxy Force</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Galaxy Force was one of the first Sega games to use the Sega Y Board, which allowed for even flashier effects and better sprite-scaling than their earlier Super Scaler boards, which had been used to create hits like Space Harrier, OutRun, and After Burner.

The place is a great American city that has been taken over by rampant crime. The corruption is led by cruel and cunning gangsters who have let fear and destruction loose in the city.

Up to four players can take control of four different characters and fight their way through a dungeon of bad guys and loot treasure. Gauntlet was the first arcade cabinet to feature four player cooperative gameplay and it caused a sensation in the Arcade when it was released in 1985.[CR][B]Classes:[/B][CR]The character classes in Gauntlet are the: Thor the Warrior, Merlin the Wizard, Thyra the Valkyrie, or Questor the Elf whose colors are red, yellow, blue and green, respectively.[CR]Each character has its own abilities. Thor the Warrior, the slowest character, deals the most damage and is also the most effective character at close range. Merlin the Wizard is a fast character who is not good at close combat but has the most powerful magic, which is activated by using a potion found in the dungeon. Questor the Elf is the fastest character but is weak at close range. His long range shots make him a good scout (the Elf player often irritates other players since his extra speed allows him to steal all the treasure before anyone else can get a look-in!). Finally, Thyra the Valkyrie is the all-rounder who neither excels nor fails in any given department.[CR]Objectives and Gameplay[CR]The objective of Gauntlet is to progress through a massive dungeon with hundreds of levels. On each level the player(s) must reach the exit in order to advance to the next level. However the dungeon's denizens are there to make reaching that exit a tough task. Dungeons are populated by all manner of nasties including: Ghosts, Grunts, Demons, Lobbers and, of course, Death himself! Enemies in Gauntlet commonly spawn from generators and will do so inexorably until the generators are destroyed. Other features of the dungeon include locked doors, secret rooms, and teleporters.[CR]Each hero has a numerical value representing their health on the the screen. This number steadily ticks down to zero even when the hero is not taking any damage. Since vast hordes of enemies are all competing for a chunk of the heroes health, it is not an easy task to survive in Gauntlet. One remedy for this rapidly diminishing health for the arcade version is to drop more coins into the slot to buy more health points. Food pick-ups are also scattered around the dungeon which boost the health of whoever collects them. Unfortunately, food only gives the hero another 100 points of health, which doesn't last long.[CR]To make life a little easier for the heroes there are power-ups which can be collected; these include temporary invisibility, an armor boost, and extra shot speed or power. Since all characters occupy the same game screen, a good deal of cooperation is required in order for a group of players to successfully navigate the levels. A good team will fairly distribute the bonuses to the most suitable hero, i.e. "let the Wizard have the potions". A bad Elf player can spoil the groups chances by snatching everything![CR]One of the most memorable features of Gauntlet is the audio. The game has an announcer who, in all his 8-bit glory, declaims important messages such as "Wizard shot the food!" or "Warrior needs food badly!" At the time, it was impressive that a game had audible speech in 1985, which was novel.[CR]Gauntlet's Origins[CR]Gauntlet was originally a copy, with some upgrades, of a game by John Palevich, who contributed his dungeon crawler to Atari through the Atari Program eXchange. Palevich later sued for compensation, or at least name recognition in the credits of the Gauntlet arcade games. Atari was said to have recognized Palevich's role in the creation of Gauntlet, but as the arcade machines were already made, they maintained that adding Palevich's name would have been prohibitively expensive. Palevich was later given token compensation from Atari in recognition of his unwitting role in the creation of this game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Free Continue[CR]After losing all lives, press any button on Controller 2, and you will be able to play on with that controller.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>				<year>1990</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>U.S. Gold Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.7</rating>				<videoid>u7RdpzS_TNU</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2755</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588069-gauntlet</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/gauntlet</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/gauntlet/3030-8594/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2755-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2755-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/54673-gauntlet-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/105590-gauntlet-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/105587-gauntlet-sega-master-system-screenshot-it-s-rather-quiet-for.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/105586-gauntlet-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-future-starts-looking.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/105584-gauntlet-sega-master-system-screenshot-grab-the-keys-to-unlock.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/105585-gauntlet-sega-master-system-screenshot-you-re-dead.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2762933-gauntlet+%28u%29+%5B%21%5D_004.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2762932-gauntlet+%28u%29+%5B%21%5D_003.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2762931-gauntlet+%28u%29+%5B%21%5D_002.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2762930-gauntlet+%28u%29+%5B%21%5D_001.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1987/936982-gauntlet_3.gif</snapshot10>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2755.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="George Foreman's KO Boxing (Europe)">				<description>George Foreman's KO Boxing (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FGeorge%20Foreman%27s%20KO%20Boxing%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="94603" />				<title_clean>George Foreman's KO Boxing</title_clean>				<plot>The Master System and Game Gear versions of George Foreman's KO Boxing are fairly identical to the other versions in concept, but there are a few notable changes. The game is a reworking of the Master System title James 'Buster' Douglas Knockout Boxing, not to be confused with the Genesis title with the same name, which is entirely different.[CR]Just like the other versions players are cast as George Foreman to go through a series of boxing matches against different opponents to win the championship title belt. Compared to the other titles, these versions have new opponents and show the boxers from the side. Players can move left or right in the ring to avoid punches. Other moves including blocking, and left and right punches that can be varied into jabs and crosses. Matches can last up to ten rounds and when no regular or technical knock-out occurs, the winner is based on the jury's points, provided between the rounds. During knock-out phases, no buttons need to be pressed to get the boxer back to his feet. At the start of the game, a slow or fast speed for the gameplay can be selected.[CR]Each match the player's boxer can use three super punches. These need to be charged and then unleashed when near an opponent. It sends them straight to the back of the ring, a dangerous area as it is easy to keep punching them into the ropes. Health is slightly restored during the intermission and after each won match the player is awarded skill points to be distributed over three characteristics. Matches for two players are supported.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]At the Speed Select screen, hold down the 2 button and press Left, Right, Left.

It was one of the last games to be released on the Sega Card format, which was phased out later the same year.[CR]Ghost House's protagonist Mick superficially resembles Sega's famous mascot Alex Kidd, as a protagonist who uses an enormous fist to punch enemies into submission, and the game takes place on multiple screens of an immense house filled with spooky creatures and secrets.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story of Ghost House is very simple: The player is Mick, a nondescript boy who has inherited a fortune. The problem is that all the treasures are scattered in a haunted house. To make matters worse they are even guarded by Dracula himself. So Mick sets out to battle Dracula and his clones to get back what is his.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay of Ghost House is as simple as the story. In every level Mick has to collect keys which are dropped by enemies he defeats. With these keys he can open a coffin in which Dracula or one of his four clones is located. After Mick has defeated all of the Dracula clones and Dracula himself, he advances to the next round. There are six rounds in total. The background of the house is always the same, though, only the color changes.[CR]Mick has two different ways of disposing of his enemies: He can punch them like Alex Kidd, or jump on their head like Mario. Depending on which foe he faces, one of the two attacks will prove to be more viable. It can be pretty risky to punch the Fire Blower for example.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]There are five different enemies in the game:Derobat: Derobats are little bats which can be found in large quantities in every level. They can be killed with one blow, but they can easily fly into Mick's face, too.Death: Contrary to the Death we know, this Death is slow and easy to defeat. He only creeps around the house slowly, without being able to attack.Fire Blower: The Fire Blower is a dangerous creature. Not only can he take a lot of hits, he also blows fire.The Mummy: A horrible fellow who follows Mick around the house.Dracula (and his clones): He can turn into a bat and attack Mick from above. Very dangerous.[CR]Apart from these enemies Mick can also be attacked by flying knives and arrows which suddenly fly through the screen. Very hard to avoid.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Ghost House is one of only eight Sega Master System games that were initially released on Sega Card outside of Japan. The other seven were: Super Tennis, Teddy Boy, Hang-On, My Hero, TransBot, Spy vs. Spy and F-16 Fighting Falcon.Ghost House has been voted into the 15 worst video game covers by 1UP.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Temporary Invinsibility.[CR]Find one of the altars that are scattered through each stage. When you walk past one of them, you should see something that looks like an arrow fly from the side of the screen straight towards you. Jump on it, and it should disappear. Now walk past the altar again and then jump on the arrow again.

The problem is that all the treasures are scattered in a haunted house. To make matters worse they are even guarded by Dracula himself. So Mick sets out to battle Dracula and his clones to get back what is his.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay of Ghost House is as simple as the story. In every level Mick has to collect keys which are dropped by enemies he defeats. With these keys he can open a coffin in which Dracula or one of his four clones is located. After Mick has defeated all of the Dracula clones and Dracula himself, he advances to the next round. There are six rounds in total. The background of the house is always the same, though, only the color changes.[CR]Mick has two different ways of disposing of his enemies: He can punch them like Alex Kidd, or jump on their head like Mario. Depending on which foe he faces, one of the two attacks will prove to be more viable. It can be pretty risky to punch the Fire Blower for example.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]There are five different enemies in the game:Derobat: Derobats are little bats which can be found in large quantities in every level. They can be killed with one blow, but they can easily fly into Mick's face, too.Death: Contrary to the Death we know, this Death is slow and easy to defeat. He only creeps around the house slowly, without being able to attack.Fire Blower: The Fire Blower is a dangerous creature. Not only can he take a lot of hits, he also blows fire.The Mummy: A horrible fellow who follows Mick around the house.Dracula (and his clones): He can turn into a bat and attack Mick from above. Very dangerous.[CR]Apart from these enemies Mick can also be attacked by flying knives and arrows which suddenly fly through the screen. Very hard to avoid.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Ghost House is one of only eight Sega Master System games that were initially released on Sega Card outside of Japan. The other seven were: Super Tennis, Teddy Boy, Hang-On, My Hero, TransBot, Spy vs. Spy and F-16 Fighting Falcon.Ghost House has been voted into the 15 worst video game covers by 1UP.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Temporary Invinsibility.[CR]Find one of the altars that are scattered through each stage. When you walk past one of them, you should see something that looks like an arrow fly from the side of the screen straight towards you. Jump on it, and it should disappear.

In the game, players start out by using their limited funds to purchase one of four vehicles, along with additional equipment necessary to catch ghosts. Players then move a Ghostbusters symbol around a map screen, plotting routes to ghost disturbances. At each disturbance, the player controls two Ghostbusters, attempting to use their proton beams to manuever the ghost over the trap they have placed and then catch the ghost. (Notably, only three Ghostbusters are ever depicted in the game, although there are four in the film.) If the player is successful in catching a ghost in the Commodore version, a voice declares "Ghostbusters!" If the player fails to do so, the ghost will slime the player, and a voice will say "He slimed me." All the while, the music consists of a rendition of the Ray Parker, Jr. hit "Ghostbusters" playing repeatedly.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]When the psychokinetic energy in the city reaches a certain level, provided that players have successfully earned some money, the game moves on to the next stage, in which players must sneak past the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man at the Temple of Zuul. In the original computer version, successfully getting two Ghostbusters past Stay-Puft resulted in the player winning the game. (Whether players win or lose, they are provided with an account number they can use to carry their earnings over to their next game, allowing them to purchase better equipment.)[CR]Later versions of the game included additional content. In the Sega Master System version, for instance, slipping past the Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man was much easier than in the original computer versions. However, players then had to make their way up the stairs of the haunted apartment building, fending off plate-throwing ghosts, and then defeat Gozer in a brief shoot-out. The NES version had a similar sequence on the staircase, but it was far more difficult due to the odd controls.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Earn $100 000[CR]Enter your name as [B]A.A.[/B] and input 2570302186 as a password to receive $100 000.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Earn $100 000[CR]Get a password, then switch the last two characters.

The game has since been ported to several home computers and consoles. It is the second entry in the notoriously-difficult Ghosts 'N Goblins franchise. Three years after Sir Arthur rescues his true love Princess Prin Prin from the evil Astaroth, Lucifer (or Loki in some versions) brings forth an army of macabre minions and steals the  souls of several helpless victims; among the souls stolen is that of Arthur's beloved. Once again, Arthur dons his trusty armor to fight the demonic hordes and rescue these lost souls.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arthur unleashes Thunder Magic[CR]Ghouls 'N Ghosts gameplay is nearly identical to that of its predecessor, but with a few notable exceptions. Arguably the most significant addition is Arthur's new ability to fire any weapon vertically up or down. Most of the original game's weapons are present and a few new weapons have been added, as well as a new set of magically-infused Golden Armor. When equipped, the Golden Armor allows Arthur to charge his current weapon to perform a powerful magic attack. Each weapon has its own unique magic, save for the Psycho Cannon.Weapons &amp; Magic Lance - Fires a lance in a straight line. Thunder Magic fires a powerful magic bolt vertically from the top of the screen towards Arthur's position, which then splits horizontally to the left and right. This weapon is called "Sword" in some versions. Sword - A strong melee-only weapon that is swung in a short arc. Thunder Dragon Magic unleashes a flaming dragon upward that attacks sky-bound enemies. This weapon is called "Super Sword" in some versions. Axe - Hurls an axe in a straight line. This weapon can penetrate objects, but has a slow rate of fire. Exploding Magic summons several large explosions around Arthur's position.Torch - Lobs a torch in a short arc; upon impact with the ground, a line of damaging flames extends across the surface. Fireball Magic creates four fireballs that swirl outward from Arthur's left and right sides. This weapon is called "Fire Water" in some versions.Discus - Fires a bladed disc in a straight line which will follow the contour of any platforms on contact. Firing while crouching causes the disc to move along the ground's surface. Mirror Magic creates a temporary protective shield ahead of Arthur's position.Dagger - Fires a dagger in a straight line. This weapon is comparatively weak, but it also has the fastest rate of fire in the game. Double Magic creates an invulnerable shadow clone of Arthur that mimics his movement and attacks for a short time.Psycho Cannon - Only available on the second playthrough. Fires a blast of powerful magic in a straight line for a short distance. This weapon cannot be charged, although its range is increased while wearing the Golden Armor.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Ghouls 'N Ghosts World[CR]The game features five Stages, each of which is split into two areas by a checkpoint.Stage One[CR]The Execution Place, a mass grave at the edge of the Demon Realm, is where Arthur begins his long quest; however, the murderous skeletons, swooping vultures and hair-trigger guillotines located here will attempt to bring his adventure to a very sudden end. This area is also a tribute to the first Stage of the original Ghosts 'N Goblins, complete with remixed music. The Stage's second half at the Floating Island on the Lake features strong winds that slow movement to a crawl. Past the island's poisonous forest, a giant demon known as Shielder protects the exit by spitting fireballs.Stage Two[CR]A constant stream of demonic turtles bounce down the slope leading to the The Village of Decay, a destroyed human settlement. After crossing a gigantic ant lion pit, Arthur is ambushed by an upgraded version of Firebrand known as the Red Arremer King. Further ahead, earthquakes and demonic flames plague the Town of Fire, a sweltering ruin terrorized by the hell-hound Cerberus.Stage Three[CR]Arthur finds himself riding a treacherous elevator up through Baron Rankle's Tower; quick movements are required to avoid being crushed against the ceiling in this auto-scrolling area. At the peak of the Horrible-Faced Mountain, Arthur boldly leaps across the outstretched tongues of several demonic statues before battling a living storm cloud called Gassuto.Stage Four[CR]Giant bones litter the floor of The Crystal Forest, a cave system leading directly into Lucifer's castle. At the halfway point, Arthur descends down the slippery slopes of The Rotting Grotto, stepping across several man-eating plants to land on the back of Ohme, a gigantic immobile worm infested with smaller creatures that collectively act as the Stage boss.Stage Five[CR]If pain was like food, then Lucifer's Castle of Evil Demons would be a feast. The entryway swarms with skeletal dragons and a gauntlet of four Red Arremer Kings as an appetizer. After climbing an ominous spiked ladder, Arthur does battle with Astaroth, the final boss of the original Ghosts 'N Goblins. Once Astaroth is dispatched, Arthur is assaulted by two Shielder heads attached to the walls of the next room. Twin Astaroths flank Arthur for a surprise rematch further ahead, followed by a trio of Gassutos. Past one final Shielder head and a legion of demonic insects, Beelzebub guards the Stage exit.[CR]After completing this Stage, Arthur receives a message that he cannot defeat Lucifer without the Psycho Cannon, a weapon blessed by the goddess of battle. In the series' tradition, Arthur is sent back to the first Stage, where players must complete the full game a second time.

The game has since been ported to several home computers and consoles. It is the second entry in the notoriously-difficult Ghosts 'N Goblins franchise. Three years after Sir Arthur rescues his true love Princess Prin Prin from the evil Astaroth, Lucifer (or Loki in some versions) brings forth an army of macabre minions and steals the  souls of several helpless victims; among the souls stolen is that of Arthur's beloved. Once again, Arthur dons his trusty armor to fight the demonic hordes and rescue these lost souls.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arthur unleashes Thunder Magic[CR]Ghouls 'N Ghosts gameplay is nearly identical to that of its predecessor, but with a few notable exceptions. Arguably the most significant addition is Arthur's new ability to fire any weapon vertically up or down. Most of the original game's weapons are present and a few new weapons have been added, as well as a new set of magically-infused Golden Armor. When equipped, the Golden Armor allows Arthur to charge his current weapon to perform a powerful magic attack. Each weapon has its own unique magic, save for the Psycho Cannon.Weapons &amp; Magic Lance - Fires a lance in a straight line. Thunder Magic fires a powerful magic bolt vertically from the top of the screen towards Arthur's position, which then splits horizontally to the left and right. This weapon is called "Sword" in some versions. Sword - A strong melee-only weapon that is swung in a short arc. Thunder Dragon Magic unleashes a flaming dragon upward that attacks sky-bound enemies. This weapon is called "Super Sword" in some versions. Axe - Hurls an axe in a straight line. This weapon can penetrate objects, but has a slow rate of fire. Exploding Magic summons several large explosions around Arthur's position.Torch - Lobs a torch in a short arc; upon impact with the ground, a line of damaging flames extends across the surface. Fireball Magic creates four fireballs that swirl outward from Arthur's left and right sides. This weapon is called "Fire Water" in some versions.Discus - Fires a bladed disc in a straight line which will follow the contour of any platforms on contact. Firing while crouching causes the disc to move along the ground's surface. Mirror Magic creates a temporary protective shield ahead of Arthur's position.Dagger - Fires a dagger in a straight line. This weapon is comparatively weak, but it also has the fastest rate of fire in the game. Double Magic creates an invulnerable shadow clone of Arthur that mimics his movement and attacks for a short time.Psycho Cannon - Only available on the second playthrough. Fires a blast of powerful magic in a straight line for a short distance. This weapon cannot be charged, although its range is increased while wearing the Golden Armor.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Ghouls 'N Ghosts World[CR]The game features five Stages, each of which is split into two areas by a checkpoint.Stage One[CR]The Execution Place, a mass grave at the edge of the Demon Realm, is where Arthur begins his long quest; however, the murderous skeletons, swooping vultures and hair-trigger guillotines located here will attempt to bring his adventure to a very sudden end. This area is also a tribute to the first Stage of the original Ghosts 'N Goblins, complete with remixed music. The Stage's second half at the Floating Island on the Lake features strong winds that slow movement to a crawl. Past the island's poisonous forest, a giant demon known as Shielder protects the exit by spitting fireballs.Stage Two[CR]A constant stream of demonic turtles bounce down the slope leading to the The Village of Decay, a destroyed human settlement. After crossing a gigantic ant lion pit, Arthur is ambushed by an upgraded version of Firebrand known as the Red Arremer King. Further ahead, earthquakes and demonic flames plague the Town of Fire, a sweltering ruin terrorized by the hell-hound Cerberus.Stage Three[CR]Arthur finds himself riding a treacherous elevator up through Baron Rankle's Tower; quick movements are required to avoid being crushed against the ceiling in this auto-scrolling area. At the peak of the Horrible-Faced Mountain, Arthur boldly leaps across the outstretched tongues of several demonic statues before battling a living storm cloud called Gassuto.Stage Four[CR]Giant bones litter the floor of The Crystal Forest, a cave system leading directly into Lucifer's castle. At the halfway point, Arthur descends down the slippery slopes of The Rotting Grotto, stepping across several man-eating plants to land on the back of Ohme, a gigantic immobile worm infested with smaller creatures that collectively act as the Stage boss.Stage Five[CR]If pain was like food, then Lucifer's Castle of Evil Demons would be a feast. The entryway swarms with skeletal dragons and a gauntlet of four Red Arremer Kings as an appetizer. After climbing an ominous spiked ladder, Arthur does battle with Astaroth, the final boss of the original Ghosts 'N Goblins. Once Astaroth is dispatched, Arthur is assaulted by two Shielder heads attached to the walls of the next room. Twin Astaroths flank Arthur for a surprise rematch further ahead, followed by a trio of Gassutos. Past one final Shielder head and a legion of demonic insects, Beelzebub guards the Stage exit.[CR]After completing this Stage, Arthur receives a message that he cannot defeat Lucifer without the Psycho Cannon, a weapon blessed by the goddess of battle. In the series' tradition, Arthur is sent back to the first Stage, where players must complete the full game a second time. While wearing the Golden Armor, players can discover the Psycho Cannon in certain treasure chests on the second playthrough.Final Boss: Lucifer[CR]The enormous Lord of Hell sits atop his throne, firing lasers from his mouth and hands and stomping his feet in a last-ditch attempt to exterminate Arthur. However, his evil strength is no match for the power of the Psycho Cannon, which Arthur uses to destroy Lucifer once and for all before reuniting with Princess Prin Prin.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]On the title screen press Left, Right, Right, Left, Right, Right, Left, Right, Right, Right, Left, Right, Left, 1.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Invincible and Slow Motion Mode[CR]Pause the game and hold 2.

Having murdered many innocent people, he also captured the king and his daughter. Death Adder's coup de gr&#226;ce was finding the magical emblem of the land, the Golden Axe. And unless the people of Yuria accept him as the land's new king, he promises to destroy it.[CR]Starting the game requires players to select one of three characters, each of which is filled with revenge. While all three share the same goal of saving the king and his daughter, and stopping Death Adder from destroying the Golden Axe, each one has individual ambitions as well.[CR]Gilius Thunderhead - a battleaxe-wielding dwarf whose twin brother was killed by Death Adder's henchmen. His heart is filled with hate for the evil being.[CR]Ax Battler - a barbarian who wields a two-handed broadsword, his desire to stop Death Adder fueled by the hatred he feels for him, because the evil being killed his mother.[CR]Tyris Flare - a longsword-wielding amazon, she wants revenge on Death Adder for the murder of both of her parents.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Story mode[CR]To advance through the game, players must fight through swarms of Death Adder's henchmen, including mace-wielders, giants, and barbarians riding dragons and other mythical creatures. Killing a henchman mounted on one of these creatures affords players the opportunity to ride it as well.[CR]Players possess the ability to cast magic spells, which require magic potions obtained by kicking small, strange-looking thieves. More magic potions equal more devastating magical attacks. Picking up meat by kicking thieves helps recover lost health on the health bar.[CR]It is also possible to play through the game cooperatively with a second player.Duel mode[CR]Duel mode was implemented in many of the ports, but it was never included in the original arcade version. In Duel mode, players must fight through a number of small stages. Each stage has a handful of enemies to defeat. Defeat all the enemies to advance to the next stage.[CR]Duel mode can be played with two players, but it changes the goal entirely. The two players will have to fight each other to see who is crowned best warrior.[CR]Port Differences[CR]The Genesis is considered the most faithful port, visually and gameplay-wise. The DOS port for PCs is based directly on the Genesis port, and is almost as faithful in terms of aesthetics when playing in VGA mode.[CR]When the game was ported to the Genesis, Sega added one extra level that takes place right after the players defeat Death Adder. Where the arcade version ends right then and there, in the Genesis version, the large dungeon doors in the background of the level open and the characters walk inside. The final level takes place in this dungeon, after which the players face a new final boss called Death Bringer.[CR]As mentioned prior, Duel Mode was a new addition to the Genesis port of the game.[CR]In the Genesis port, when enemies are defeated, they flash and disappear as opposed to turning to stone.[CR]Some of the more graphics-intensive varieties of spell effects did not make it over to the home ports of the game. For instance, when Ax Battler is carrying his maximum capacity of potions, the spell he unleashes in the arcade version features a mushroom cloud emanating from the floor with huge rocks erupting towards the screen. In the DOS version, this high-level spell merely looks like a series of small eruptions scattered around the screen. The Genesis version aims to replicate the spell more effectively, but the rocks are smaller and they spit out to the side rather than scaling towards the screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Continues[CR]After you've used up your last continue, press [B]Up+2[/B] while holding during the game over screen.

The world is grid-based and shown from an overhead perspective. Progress is heavily based on tiered exploration, backtracking and searching every inch of the screen for secret entrances. In a somewhat mean move, Sega included bad NPCs that take horns (in-game currency) from you, essentially punishing you for finding the secret entrance in the first place. There are also a lot  of RPG staples like hotels and traders, most of them hidden. Convenient!This game uses a battery for the saved games, something very uncommon for the Sega Master System. Outside of the villages, you have to find save points yourself which can be quite inconvenient. Since the entrances are not marked in any way, you have to memorize which one leads to a trader, a hotel and so forth. There are no signposts in this game, either. In turn, you will find yourself wandering around aimlessly quite a bit. As far as the villages themselves go, they are pretty sparse and usually only one screen large.There are several dungeons in this game, too. They are conveniently numbered which is helpful if you accidentally wind up in a later dungeon like number IV, which is accessible right from the start. Exploration inside a dungeon is based on small keys, not unlike Zelda. There is a big treasure chest in every dungeon, and since they contain important items, you can't afford to miss any of them. There are also some switch puzzles, but nothing too fancy. Sega included another somewhat sadistic mechanic with a number of pushable chandeliers that can't be distinguished from the normal ones. Since there are at least two of them on every screen in a dungeon, you end up violently pushing innocent chandeliers in true trial-and-error fashion.That left chandelier was a switch  Most enemies in this game are color-coded, the basic version being green and fairly easy to beat. The blue versions often have special abilities like more powerful projectiles or the ability to multiply. The red ones are just nasty and should be avoided until clearing the first few dungeons. They are used to keep players from exploring too far. There is always the option to brute force your way through them, but sooner or later you will hit a dead end because you lack a certain item. All of this should be very familiar to Zelda players.What a rip-off!There is also a map, an inventory, a trading system, and a simple variation of "pick a card". You can buy small keys for the dungeons at the risk of potentially missing large parts of them. There are also some better armors, shields, and weapons in this game. The red armor can actually start to rust - a status that can be remedied with magic oil. Some items, like the Knight's Shield, are only available at certain traders once they are found.The health is indicated by small hearts, the magic power by blue pitchers. The heart-meter can be enlarged by defeating bosses and  finding or being given a heart (unlike Zelda, there are only full ones). Food is used to refill your health and is either dropped by enemies or can be bought from traders. The latter is the only way to get Golden Apples which will refill all your hearts once selected in the inventory and activated.Bullet hellAnother noteworthy aspect is the strangely high number of projectiles in this game. Seemingly everything can shoot, even ancient skulls in the desert. On some screens, this game turns into a regular RPG bullet hell with red balls flying at you from all sides, especially around coastlines.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Defeat Death Adder without getting hit[CR]As soon as you enter the room with Death Adder do not move.  Your character should not actually be visible because he should be standing in the door way.  Death Adder will try to attack you, but he will not be able to hit you.  He should eventually walk up to you, but he still will not be able to hit you.  Once he is in range just keep swinging your weapon, but make sure to not move your character.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1991</releasedate>				<year>1991</year>				<genre>Action, RPG</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>				<rating>3.7</rating>				<ESRB>T - Teen</ESRB>				<videoid>ttD1ei0ND14</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2800</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588075-golden-axe-warrior</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/golden-axe-warrior</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/golden-axe-warrior/3030-10657/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8818</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2800-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2800-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/207253-golden-axe-warrior-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/78680-golden-axe-warrior-sega-master-system-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/78681-golden-axe-warrior-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/78682-golden-axe-warrior-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-town.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/78683-golden-axe-warrior-sega-master-system-screenshot-talking-to.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/78684-golden-axe-warrior-sega-master-system-screenshot-it-s-good.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/78685-golden-axe-warrior-sega-master-system-screenshot-at-an-inn.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/78686-golden-axe-warrior-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-overworld.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/78687-golden-axe-warrior-sega-master-system-screenshot-that-reminds.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/78688-golden-axe-warrior-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-dungeon.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/78689-golden-axe-warrior-sega-master-system-screenshot-inside-a-dungeon.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2800-1.jpg</fanart1>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/fogfpj9.png</banner1>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2800.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Golfamania (Europe)">				<description>Golfamania (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FGolfamania%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="140016" />				<title_clean>Golfamania</title_clean>				<plot>Golfamania is a golfing simulation game where players play on an 18 hole golf course with all the rules and scoring like in the real game.[CR]Within the game there are 4 different modes to play on that includes Practice, Match Play, Stroke Play, and Pro Tournament. In Practice a single player can play any of the 18 holes available. Match Play is 2 player mode against human or computer. Stroke Play is the player can play up to 4 others that can include 1 computer player. In this mode the character skill can increase in 3 different areas that are power, accuracy, and luck with the 6 different characters available. The main mode is the Pro Tournament and it is where the player plays against over 30 computer players (all playing different holes) with the objective to score lower than the other players (as per the rules of golf). Based on performance the player can earn experience points (XP) that they can use to upgrade the power, accuracy, and luck of the character for future tournaments. Some of the holes have awards like longest drive and hole in one awards that can earn bonus XP.     [CR]Regardless of the mode the game is played in the same sort of way. The player selects a character (the selection depends on the mode) and then sets up the character by naming and picking their style.  In all modes but Practice the player must pick 3 golf clubs that they must remove from their selection of 17 different clubs (1-5 wood, 1-9 Iron, Pitching Wedge, Sand Wedge, and Putter). When playing the player is presented with a top down view where the player lines up the shot and the location on the golf ball they want to hit (for spin). Then the player selects the club they want to use (all go varying distances). When that is all done the player must play the skill part of the game, where they are presented with a power bar that has a marker that going is up and down along it. The player must stop the marker on the red area in the centre of the power bar to get a good hit (with the center been a perfect hit)and if this area is missed the ball will only travel about 20 yards (compared to about 100+ yards of a good hit). The amount of red that is on the power bar depends on the golf club used. To help the player the distance of the shot can be lowered in exchange for a lower marker speed and can be used for shots closer to the hole (very helpful for putter shots).

The game uses battery backed RAM save to continue play later.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Take a Mulligan[CR]After playing a bad stroke, and when the words ''In the Rough'' appear on the screen, press the Resest button to take the same shot again.</plot>				<releasedate>1/6/1990</releasedate>				<year>1990</year>				<genre>Sports</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1-4 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<videoid>v2F5RM98UeA</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2801</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588076-golfamania</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/golfamania</mobygames_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2801-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/256537-golfamania-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/256538-golfamania-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/349533-golfamania-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348870-golfamania-sega-master-system-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348871-golfamania-sega-master-system-screenshot-selecting-a-player.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348872-golfamania-sega-master-system-screenshot-selecting-a-player.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348873-golfamania-sega-master-system-screenshot-setting-up-my-character.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348874-golfamania-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-start-of-a-new.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348875-golfamania-sega-master-system-screenshot-lining-up-the-shot.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348876-golfamania-sega-master-system-screenshot-waiting-for-the-ideal.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348877-golfamania-sega-master-system-screenshot-it-hits-the-green.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/348878-golfamania-sega-master-system-screenshot-so-the-ball-lands.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Golvellius (USA, Europe)">				<description>Golvellius (USA, Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FGolvellius%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" size="165966" />				<title_clean>Golvellius</title_clean>				<plot>Enter the world of Golvellius.

There is also an extra Arcade track for the player to race on.[CR]There are 3 modes of play that are Arcade, Tournament, and Grand Prix. In Arcade the player races on only 1 track that is named Arcade. In Tournament players get to choose any number of tracks to race, from 0 (which defaults to the Arcade track) to all 15 available tracks. Grand Prix is where the player races in all 15 tracks in order of the 1989 season. [CR]All races regardless of the mode played in the same way. The game is played on a split screen even if only one player is playing. A CPU character named Wayne controls the bike on the top screen if there is no other player playing. Wayne races like a real player would, having both good and bad races and occasionally making mistakes. The race is made up of a Qualify to determine gird position and then the Race where the player races 15 other races (including Wayne) over a predefined number of laps depending on track length. The track can raced in ether the wet or the dry (only dry in Arcade mode) and the weather can change from the Qualify to the Race. The races take place on flat roads with straights and curves simulating the layout of the real track. On the bike there is a fuel gage that simply counts down the seconds left of fuel and is automatically refilled at the completion of each lap. If the player doesnt complete the lap before time runs out then the player will Out of Fuel and end the race in the placed down with other non-finishers. At the end of each race (accept in Arcade mode) the player will get points depending on there position before going onto the next race.[CR]The player sets up the bike with some basic set ups that are all available from the start. In Arcade mode the player has the options of an Automatic or Manual gearbox with either High Gearing (better top speed) or Low Gearing (better acceleration). In Tournament and Grand Prix modes the options are extended to Engine type of Lean, Medium, and Thirsty which progressively adds speed while cutting the time available per lap. There is gearing that works the same as Arcade mode, and a tyre type of wet and dry depending on the weather.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1992</releasedate>				<year>1993</year>				<genre>Driving, Racing</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Alt</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>				<videoid>9-1dMU94Q7U</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2803</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570227-gp-rider</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/gp-rider</mobygames_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2803-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/145959-gp-rider-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/334759-gp-rider-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/334760-gp-rider-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen-2.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/334761-gp-rider-sega-master-system-screenshot-menu.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/334762-gp-rider-sega-master-system-screenshot-track-data-for-the.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/334763-gp-rider-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-basic-setup-in.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/334764-gp-rider-sega-master-system-screenshot-getting-ready-to-go.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/334765-gp-rider-sega-master-system-screenshot-wayne-is-about-to-take.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/334766-gp-rider-sega-master-system-screenshot-wayne-takes-the-qualifying.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/334767-gp-rider-sega-master-system-screenshot-i-am-way-down-in-14th.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/334768-gp-rider-sega-master-system-screenshot-i-am-prepared-let-s.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Great Baseball (Japan)">				<description>Great Baseball (Japan)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FGreat%20Baseball%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="24067" />				<title_clean>Great Baseball</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mark III - 1985 version[CR]This game was released in 1985 in Japan for their Mark III system.

The game used one button to pass and the other to shoot.[CR]The player can choose one of eight national teams: USA, Canada, USSR, Japan, Cuba, Czechoslovakia (as it wouldn't become two separate nations until 1993), Italy and Hungary.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1987</releasedate>				<year>1987</year>				<genre>Sports</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>2.6</rating>				<videoid>nYedEizFY2k</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2806</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588079-great-basketball</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/great-basketball</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/great-basketball/3030-18865/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2806-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2806-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/154235-great-basketball-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/187401-great-basketball-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/93835-great-basketball-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/93836-great-basketball-sega-master-system-screenshot-select-your.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/93837-great-basketball-sega-master-system-screenshot-game-play.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/93838-great-basketball-sega-master-system-screenshot-japan-scores.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/93839-great-basketball-sega-master-system-screenshot-penalty-pushing.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/93840-great-basketball-sega-master-system-screenshot-penalty-charging.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/93841-great-basketball-sega-master-system-screenshot-usa-scores-two.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/93842-great-basketball-sega-master-system-screenshot-penalty-out.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/b/e/gfs_3829_2_1.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/6/e/gfs_3829_2_2.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Great Football (World)">				<description>Great Football (World)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FGreat%20Football%20%28World%29.zip" size="53679" />				<title_clean>Great Football</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The final game in the Great sports series, Great Football covers Football (or American Football). It had an alternate release as Sports Pad Football, which required the use of the Sega Sports Pad accessory. It was released on the same day as Great Volleyball and Great Basketball in Japan.[CR]Though the player can choose between the AFC and NFC conferences, the teams are entirely invented and have names like "the Beavers" or "the Knights".[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game plays like a regular game of football with one exception: The computer never plays offense, leaving the player in full control of the ball at all times. However, the computer initially begins with a certain number of points which the player must beat in order to win. Otherwise, it plays like a regular football game: The player must pick a formation/play from a list of available options and then find a way to get the ball as far downfield as possible, preferably to the endzone where they can score some points with a touchdown.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1987</releasedate>				<year>1987</year>				<genre>Sports</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>2.2</rating>				<videoid>2nncNWyaS0Y</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2808</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570160-great-football</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/great-football</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/great-football/3030-14056/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2808-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2808-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/107698-great-football-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/261052-great-football-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/301151-great-football-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart5>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412536-great-football-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412537-great-football-sega-master-system-screenshot-field.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412538-great-football-sega-master-system-screenshot-league-select.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412539-great-football-sega-master-system-screenshot-afc.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412540-great-football-sega-master-system-screenshot-nfc.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412541-great-football-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-pass.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412542-great-football-sega-master-system-screenshot-score-board.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412543-great-football-sega-master-system-screenshot-formation-select.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/4/9/gfs_87278_2_1.jpg</snapshot9>				<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/2808-g.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Great Golf (World) (Beta)">				<description>Great Golf (World) (Beta)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FGreat%20Golf%20%28World%29%20%28Beta%29.zip" size="56950" />				<title_clean>Great Golf</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Great Golf is, like every other Great Sports title, a rather straightforward adaptation of its chosen sport.

There are also plenty of hazards, such as sand and water traps, to be wary of on each hole of the course.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1987</releasedate>				<year>1987</year>				<genre>Simulation, Sports</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1-4 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>2.1</rating>				<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>				<videoid>6Iiva9HDWhQ</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2810</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588080-great-golf</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/great-golf</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/great-golf/3030-17867/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8587</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2286034-greatgolfjp_sms_jp_front.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2810-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/119349-great-golf-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/154266-great-golf-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/249619-great-golf-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart5>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101980-great-golf-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101981-great-golf-sega-master-system-screenshot-players-selection.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101982-great-golf-sega-master-system-screenshot-name-entry.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101983-great-golf-sega-master-system-screenshot-club-selection.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101984-great-golf-sega-master-system-screenshot-course-map.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101985-great-golf-sega-master-system-screenshot-game-play.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101986-great-golf-sega-master-system-screenshot-man-saying-hi-to.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101987-great-golf-sega-master-system-screenshot-move-your-feet-to.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101988-great-golf-sega-master-system-screenshot-select-your-speed.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/101989-great-golf-sega-master-system-screenshot-what-a-poor-shot.jpg</snapshot10>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/TJnTnu7.png</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Great Ice Hockey (Japan, USA)">				<description>Great Ice Hockey (Japan, USA)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FGreat%20Ice%20Hockey%20%28Japan%2C%20USA%29.zip" size="30113" />				<title_clean>Great Ice Hockey</title_clean>				<plot>Welcome to the Big Leagues.

The player is also able to assign stat points to the various skills required in volleyball, such as serving and spiking the ball; this allows them to focus on their strengths and customize their experience somewhat. The player can also choose between a Goodwill Match (basically an exhibition) mode, the more serious Tournament mode and a Practice mode for getting to grips with the system.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1987</releasedate>				<year>1987</year>				<genre>Sports</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Alt</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<videoid>TXhq1eP1x98</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2816</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588083-great-volleyball</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/great-volleyball</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/great-volleyball/3030-19590/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/12/122766/2092980-great_volleyball_front.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2816-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/75239-great-volleyball-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/149152-great-volleyball-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/301065-great-volleyball-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart5>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/198558-great-volleyball-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/198559-great-volleyball-sega-master-system-screenshot-you-can-choose.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/198560-great-volleyball-sega-master-system-screenshot-there-s-eight.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/198561-great-volleyball-sega-master-system-screenshot-before-the.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/198562-great-volleyball-sega-master-system-screenshot-yes-your-characters.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/198563-great-volleyball-sega-master-system-screenshot-then-again.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/198564-great-volleyball-sega-master-system-screenshot-team-usa-gets.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/198565-great-volleyball-sega-master-system-screenshot-and-team-usa.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/1/5/d/gfs_3832_2_1.jpg</snapshot9>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2816-1.jpg</fanart1>			</game>			<game name="Gun.Smoke (Korea) (Unl)">				<description>Gun.Smoke (Korea) (Unl)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FGun.Smoke%20%28Korea%29%20%28Unl%29.zip" size="18700" />				<title_clean>Gun.Smoke</title_clean>			</game>			<game name="Haja no Fuuin (Japan)">				<description>Haja no Fuuin (Japan)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FHaja%20no%20Fuuin%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="164669" />				<title_clean>Haja no Fuuin</title_clean>				<plot>Fate calls thee to bar evil's way!

It was developed by Sega's Japanese AM2 studio and designed by Yu Suzuki, and it was their first major hit. It is the world's first full-body-experience video game (according to GameCenter CX, Season 2, Episode 13). In the game, the player controls a motorcycle against time and other computer-controlled bikes. It was one of the first arcade games to use true 16-bit graphics and Sega's "Super Scaler" technology that allowed pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates.[CR]The game ran on the Sega Hang-On arcade system board, which later ran Space Harrier and Enduro Racer. It was subsequently ported to the Sega Master System console as a pack-in, built-in game, released for Japan on October 20, 1985, and for Europe in 1985. It was also ported to the MSX home computer by Pony Canyon in 1986, exclusively for Japan. A version called Hang-On II was also released for the Sega SG-1000 console (also compatible with the Sega SC-3000 computer) in 1985, also exclusive to Japan.[CR]The title "Hang-On" was inspired by a turning technique of the same name used by motorbike racers that series creator Yu Suzuki found in a Japanese motorcycle magazine. It is a technique where the biker is turning and has to "hang on" to the bike while the bike is leaning, Suzuki later learned that the technique in English is referred to as "hang off"; nevertheless, the name "Hang-On" stuck (according to GameCenter CX, Episode 10, 2003).[CR]The arcade game was a popular Grand Prix style rear-view motorbike racer. It was regarded as the first motorbike simulator for its realism at the time, in both the handling of the player's motorbike and the artificial intelligence of the computer-controlled motorcyclists. It was also the first full-body-experience video game, as it was the first video game to use a motion-controlled hydraulic cabinet, along with force feedback technology, which revolutionized and revitalized the arcade game industry. It was also one of the first arcade games to use 16-bit pseudo-3D graphics, introducing Sega's "Super Scaler" technology, which allowed rapid sprite-scaling at high frame rates. In addition, the Yamaha YM2203 sound chip also introduced the use of digitized drums to chiptune music.[CR]The pseudo-3D sprite/tile scaling was handled in a similar manner to textures in later texture-mapped polygonal 3D games of the 1990s. Yu Suzuki stated in an interview that his "designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from Hang-On. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D." The original arcade version was controlled using a cabinet resembling a motorbike, which the player moved with their body. This began the "Taikan" trend, the use of motion-controlled arcade cabinets (including hydraulic motion cabinets) in many arcade games of the late 1980s, two decades before motion controls became popular on video game consoles.[CR]It was followed by a sequel, Super Hang-On, released in 1987.

It was reviewed by Clare Edgeley in the December 1985 issue of Computer and Video Games (page 89). She stated that Hang-On "is the most realistic racing game to hit the arcades for a long while." She described it as a "fantastic" and "thrilling ride" on a motor bike "you have to sit on" that is "life size" with "the throttle and brake" where "they would be on a real machine." She criticized the "expensive" price of 50 pence per play (equivalent to &#163;1.32 or $2.09 in 2015) but noted, "with practice you will be able to stretch it for miles." She stated "the most unique feature is the act of cornering" where "you have to physically lean the bike over" and the "bike on screen follows suit" while not doing so has the bike "career straight off the track" but noted it requires "a bit of muscle power". She concluded that it combines "superb graphics" with "the physical act of riding a bike" and is "great."[CR]The arcade game also received a positive review in the February 1987 issue of Sinclair User, where it was reviewed again by Clare Edgeley, retrospectively. She stated that Hang-On "launched on an unsuspecting world" with a "totally new dimension of gaming", a "motor cycle which you could sit on and tilt from side to side to corner the bends." She described this as "Amazing" and "Such a simple idea" that she was "surprised someone didn't come up with it earlier." She noted that, when "cornering, the angle you need to tilt the bike corresponds to your speed", where "the faster you take a bend, the greater the angle you have to tilt the bike, and then remember to bring it back to the level for the straight", and the need to "dodge hazards and other bikers" by tilting "the bike slightly" to "slide out in that direction." She also noted that, since its release, Sega "seems to have cornered the market" for "bike simulations" with Hang-On and Enduro Racer.Sega Master System VersionReception (Sega Master System)Aggregate scoresAggregatorScoreSega Retro80% (5 reviews)Review scoresPublicationScoreComputer and Video Games9/10MicroMania80%Sega Power80%Sega Pro78%[CR]The Master System port was also well received, with an average aggregate score of 80% at Sega Retro based on five reviews.

They criticized it, however, for lacking "some of the nice touches of the Mega Drive version," but concluded that Hang-On for the Master System is "still a damn fine racing game" and "very playable."[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1985</releasedate>				<year>1985</year>				<genre>Driving, Racing</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.1</rating>				<videoid>czvFRvCLxqI</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2817</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588084-hang-on</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/hang-on</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/hang-on/3030-11570/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/7406</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/13/139866/2439132-16003601.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2817-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/301130-hang-on-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/147886-hang-on-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51963-hang-on-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51964-hang-on-sega-master-system-screenshot-opponents-on-the-road.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51965-hang-on-sega-master-system-screenshot-don-t-try-to-push-other.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2728253-1573084675-super.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/13/139866/2595632-2417044-9779588133-hang-.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/500/1339370-limited_edition_hang_on.png</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/500/1339369-hang_on_arcade.png</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/500/1339368-hang_onsafari_hunt_sms_screenshot1.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/500/1339367-gfs_37162_2_1.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/500/1339366-19573_1.png</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2817-1.jpg</fanart1>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/b5WaU5B.png</banner1>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2817.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Hang-On &amp; Astro Warrior (USA)">				<description>Hang-On &amp; Astro Warrior (USA)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FHang-On%20%26%20Astro%20Warrior%20%28USA%29.zip" size="64814" />				<title_clean>Hang-On &amp; Astro Warrior</title_clean>				<plot>HANG ON is the 3D motorcycle race game that's taken the arcades by storm.

Telling the stories of eight heroes as they traverse across the ruined city of Xak Tsaroth, the game pits players against various enemies leading up to a confrontation with the ancient dragon Khisanth who holds the Disks of Mishakal, an ancient and powerful relic. It is the first in a series of three games developed by U.S. Gold under the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons name.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Differing drastically from Dungeons &amp; Dragons games from the past, Heroes of the Lance's central focus is on side-scrolling action as opposed to role-playing. Although the game would use relevant statistics, spells and rules from the official tabletop game, a difficult to use graphical interface and severe limitation on character use (forcing players to control one at a time, thus limiting creativity) meant that this arcade-like style of gameplay would be short lived for the series as fans rallied against the switch.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]NameDescriptionPortraitGoldmoonA human cleric betrothed to Riverwind.

Though, I guess that and the rather dry script make it a very authentic translation for a game of its age.[CR]It would have been nice if the authors had released the translation as a patch, but what this thing really needs is a readme, because without any clues the game is beyond understanding.[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/883/[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/2005</releasedate>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>Sega</studio>				<videoid>TQNiossvstc</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2828</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/566697-high-school-kimengumi</gamefaqs_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2828-1.jpg</boxart1>				<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/e/b/gfs_5491_1_1.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/7/6/gfs_5491_2_1.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/a/6/gfs_5491_2_2.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/1/6/gfs_5491_2_3.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/0/6/gfs_5491_2_4.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/b/6/gfs_5491_2_5.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/6/6/gfs_5491_2_6.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/d/6/gfs_5491_2_7.jpg</snapshot8>			</game>			<game name="Hokuto no Ken (Japan)">				<description>Hokuto no Ken (Japan)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FHokuto%20no%20Ken%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="84496" />				<title_clean>Hokuto no Ken</title_clean>				<plot>One of the first in a long line of games built upon Bronson's and Tetsuya Hara's long running Hokuto no Ken series (also known as Fist of the North Star).[CR]The protagonist, Kenshiro, must travel across the barren wastelands that the world has turned into after nuclear war, looking for his woman, Julia.

The object of the game is to stop the mad genius Elvin Atombender from launching a nuclear attack using cracked military computers all over the world. The original version is famous for having sampled speech, which was rare at the time. Elvin's opening line "Another visitor. Stay awhile - stay forever!" is well known amongst C64 players.The player assumes the role of Agent 4125 who is sent to Elvin's underground stronghold. To reach Elvin, a nine-letter password must be found to open the control room door. The password is assembled from pieces of punch cards found all over the complex. The mission must be completed in six hours, with ten minutes taken off the clock each time the player dies.Agent hard at workThere are 32 rooms, randomly arranged in each game and connected by elevators and corridors. The rooms contain pieces of furniture standing on platforms of varying height, most often guarded by robots. The furniture must be searched while avoiding the robots to obtain either password cards or other useful codes, such as lift resets and snoozes that make the robots freeze for a short while. There are also two code rooms that contain a music note puzzle; lift resets and snoozes can be obtained by playing back the notes in ascending order.The robots' behaviour patterns are different in each game. There are about a dozen different combinations for their movement and firing patterns and it is usually possible - necessary, even - to determine the robot's program by observing it for a moment before trying to pass. Some robots simply drive back and forth on the platform, while others actively follow the player as far as they can and fire their zappers whenever the player is nearby.

The object of the game is to stop the mad genius Elvin Atombender from launching a nuclear attack using cracked military computers all over the world. The original version is famous for having sampled speech, which was rare at the time. Elvin's opening line "Another visitor. Stay awhile - stay forever!" is well known amongst C64 players.The player assumes the role of Agent 4125 who is sent to Elvin's underground stronghold. To reach Elvin, a nine-letter password must be found to open the control room door. The password is assembled from pieces of punch cards found all over the complex. The mission must be completed in six hours, with ten minutes taken off the clock each time the player dies.Agent hard at workThere are 32 rooms, randomly arranged in each game and connected by elevators and corridors. The rooms contain pieces of furniture standing on platforms of varying height, most often guarded by robots. The furniture must be searched while avoiding the robots to obtain either password cards or other useful codes, such as lift resets and snoozes that make the robots freeze for a short while. There are also two code rooms that contain a music note puzzle; lift resets and snoozes can be obtained by playing back the notes in ascending order.The robots' behaviour patterns are different in each game. There are about a dozen different combinations for their movement and firing patterns and it is usually possible - necessary, even - to determine the robot's program by observing it for a moment before trying to pass. Some robots simply drive back and forth on the platform, while others actively follow the player as far as they can and fire their zappers whenever the player is nearby. The player has no weapons except for the snoozes, and skillful jumping is needed to stay clear of the robots.Solving the puzzleOnce the punch card pieces are found, the cards must be assembled in a jigsaw-like manner. Four different pieces must be flipped in the correct orientation, combined and changed to the correct color to make up one card, which yields a letter of the password. Once the password is known, the big blue door found in one of the rooms can be opened to end the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Area Passwords[CR]Enter the appropriate password to go to the desired area:</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>				<year>1990</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>U.S. Gold Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>2.9</rating>				<videoid>kw1nEZ03fWU</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2852</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588085-impossible-mission</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/impossible-mission</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/impossible-mission/3030-14849/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10709</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2365974-a7800_impossiblemission.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2852-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164467-impossible-mission-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/55306-impossible-mission-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/55307-impossible-mission-sega-master-system-screenshot-exploring.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/55308-impossible-mission-sega-master-system-screenshot-one-of-many.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/55309-impossible-mission-sega-master-system-screenshot-searching.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/55310-impossible-mission-sega-master-system-screenshot-hmm-nothing.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/55311-impossible-mission-sega-master-system-screenshot-figure-this.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/55312-impossible-mission-sega-master-system-screenshot-using-a-computer.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/55313-impossible-mission-sega-master-system-screenshot-argh-one-of.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/6763/418094-s_impossiblemission_5.png</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/6763/418093-s_impossiblemission_4.png</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2852-1.jpg</fanart1>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/uG6hIQN.png</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Incredible Crash Dummies, The (Europe)">				<description>Incredible Crash Dummies, The (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FIncredible%20Crash%20Dummies%2C%20The%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="116764" />				<title_clean>Incredible Crash Dummies, The</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Incredible Crash Dummies (known as "The Incredible Crash Dummies: Slick Bouya no Daichousen" in Japan. The subtitle roughly translates as "Slick's Great Challenge") is an action platformer game based on the Incredible Crash Dummies license, a toy series that became an animated TV show. The player controls Slick, one of the titular Incredible Crash Dummies, and must rescue Dr Zub from the evil Junkman before he can use the good Doctor's knowledge to create an army of robots.[CR]The game was released on many home systems of the era, some of which varied slightly in their presentation and gameplay. [CR]Game Boy Version[CR]The Game Boy version of The Incredible Crash Dummies featured many different forms of gameplay, resembling more of a mini-game collection than its Super Nintendo counterpart. Players must either successfully crash the playable dummy, or successfully pass the Dummy through various levels.Levels (Dummy Stunts)[CR]Five separate stunts await the Dummy for testing. The Roof Jump comprises of a vertical drop off the edge of a burning building. Players receive more points for each awning they are able to break, and for each fire hazard they are able to avoid. A target is painted on the sidewalk, which the Dummy must hit in order to progress to the next stage of testing.[CR]The Air Bumper stage puts the Dummy behind the wheel of a new car model, with improved air bumper safety features. The player must steer the car over air cans in order to inflate the bumper, while avoiding large pits on the test track, along with oil slicks that cause the Dummy's vehicle to spin out.[CR]The Ski Slope tests the Dummy's agility and reflexes, as trees must be avoided, and points are awarded for any jumps completed.[CR]The Dummy proceeds to enter the Bomb Factory, where the player must ensure the quality of bombs created by blowing out any lit fuses. Failing to do so on any three bombs will result in the stunt starting over. Conveyor belts move the bombs from the top of the screen to the bottom, with other various items. The Dummy is instructed to smash all of the other items with a mallet, ensuring that only quality tested bombs make it through the factory.[CR]The Cruise Missle stunt is an arcade style level, where the player navigates a space ship in an extremely low gravity environment. Changing the ship's trajectory requires rotating the vehicle and igniting the engine, creating a delicate balance between speed and maneuverability as the player is timed. The Dummy must crash the ship on yet another bulls eye, ending the stunt.[CR]After the end of each stunt, the Dummy's boss will critique the player's work. The Dummy receives cash if the stunt went as planned, and a small bonus if the boss was impressed. Three levels of difficulty are presented, with easy, normal, and hard, encouraging the player to revisit each stunt for more cash.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the SNES version a review score of 4 out of 10. Mike Weigand wrote, "...This side-scrolling, survive the levels-type game is cute at times, but the poor control and mandatory cheap hits by enemies ruin things".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat mode[CR]To enter cheat mode, at the title screen, press down, up, left, right when the title text changes.

It features the piscine special agent in a new mission at the North Pole. Unlike its free-form predecessor, James Pond 2 is a far more traditional side-scrolling platformer.[CR]The game was originally released on the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST and the Sega Genesis in 1991. They were followed with ports to the Amiga CD32, C64, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Master System and the Super Nintendo. It has recently received additional graphically enhanced ports for the Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Network.[CR]There have been multiple publishers for the game. The SNES port alone has three: Victor Interactive Software published the game in Japan, American Softworks in the US and Ocean Software in Europe. EA, US Gold and others have published the game on other systems.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]James Pond 2: Codename Robocod is a side-scrolling platformer which is very similar in feel and gameplay to the early Super Mario Bros. games. The player takes on the role of James Pond; a walking fish with body armor who must free all of the Penguins and Toys that the evil Dr. Maybe has captured. In addition to the more traditional elements of platforming, the player has the ability to extend James' body vertically in order to reach platforms and items. He also has access to a number of vehicles throughout the game, such as cars, biplanes and a flying bath.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The UK version of the game contains one of the earliest known forms of in-game product placements with the Penguins in the game advertising the "Penguin" chocolate bar by McVities.The SNES version of the game was called Super James Pond in North America, whereas in other regions it was called Super James Pond 2.The Playstation, Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS versions of the game are re-makes rather than ports, with changes to music, level design and art, they are generally considered to be inferior games.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly's Mike Weigand revealed little in his short review of the SNES version of the game other than his review score of 5 out of ten. He wrote, "...James's ability to make himself tall is quite interesting, but that is really the only special thing about him". He suggested that fans of the franchise may prefer Aquatic Games.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Lives[CR]At the start of the game go through the first door and head right and past 2 sets of spikes and you will see these items. lips, ice cream, violin, Earth, snowman collect them in that order to give you Infinite Lives[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Lives[CR]When you first start the game run right and stretch up onto a roof.

Joe Montana was paid to use his likeness in the game. Sega did not have the rights from the NFL though, so there were no actual NFL teams in the games. Instead, teams were generic teams named after cities, and Joe Montana is the only actual NFL player in the game. [CR][B]Modes:[/B][CR]Sega Bowl: Play 4 teams consecutively, each team tougher than the last, win all four and you win the championship. [CR]Normal: An exhibition game, you can choose between 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, or 60 minute long games. [CR]2 Minute Drill: Your team starts the game losing and on your own 20-yard line, and there are only two minutes left in the game. You must come back from behind to win. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Offense: On offense you controlled the quarterback, and there is a helmet cam to show where the receiver is when it is a pass play. You can switch between receivers. When you have the ball you can dive or lower your head to try to break tackles. [CR]Defense: On defense you had the ability to deliver a "bone-crushing" tackle that had the ability to injure the player with the ball or make them fumble. [CR]Penalties: Some penalties were called in this game: Offsides (being on the wrong side of the ball before the snap), Pass Interference (hitting a receiver before the ball gets to him), Delay of Game (failing to start an offensive play before the play clock expires). Penalties can be turned off, this means that they won't be called (Offsides will stop the play, but yards won't be lost) Playbook: Each team has the same 24 offensive plays (11 passing, 9 rushing, 4 special teams) and the same 24 defensive plays.[CR][B]Teams:[/B][CR]Teams were divided into four categories: Top-Notch, Strong, Good, and fair. There were 4 team in each category. Better teams were faster and could throw and kick farther. There is no difficulty setting in this game, so playing as a weaker team is the only way to increase the challenge. [CR]Each team had an analysis and hints on beating them   before the game, this was known as Joe's Game Plan. Top Notch Teams [CR]San Francisco (NFL counterpart- San Francisco 49ers): "So you want to take on my teammates and me. Well, you will have to throw the ball deep to beat us...and shut me down in the 4th quarter." [CR]New York (NFL counterpart- New York Giants): "The defense is the core of this team. Their linebackers are relentless, but you can win with short passes. The QB is a consistent winner, and their halfback is a real workhorse." [CR]Los Angeles (NFL counterpart- Los Angeles Raiders):   "Offensively, this team possesses the most explosive backfield in the league. The defense tends to over-commit, so establish your running game. But hold onto the ball-- you're going to get hit hard." [CR]Buffalo (NFL counterpart- Buffalo Bills): "You'll be able to pass deep on the cornerbacks, but watch out for their all-pro linebackers on the short ones. The QB has a cannon arm, and the receivers are always a threat for the long bomb." Strong Teams [CR]Miami (NFL counterpart- Miami Dolphins): "This team's all around solid defense is stingy on the points, but they can be beat with passes underneath the secondary. The QB has a quick release, and his receivers can burn, so you'll need to play good pass defense." [CR]Chicago (NFL counterpart- Chicago Bears): "Set them up with the running game, then go deep over the middle, but be prepared to take some big hits. Their powerful offensive line will create big holes for their speedy halfback, so play tight defense." [CR]Washington (NFL counterpart- Washington Redskins): "You can take advantage of their swarming defense by calling misdirection and play action plays. Their trio of receivers is the best in the league, so get to the QB early." [CR]Kansas City (NFL counterpart- Kansas City Chiefs): "Keep the ball away from their all-pro defensive secondary by establishing your running game. Get ready to face a consistent QB, supported by a powerful runner. Great kicking game." Good Teams [CR]Houston (NFL counterpart- Houston Oilers): "Watch out for the right side pass rush, and the quick secondary. The QB heads a high powered offensive attack. Take advantage of weak linebackers with flare passes." [CR]Philadelphia (NFL counterpart- Philadelphia Eagles): "These guys are slow up front on defense, so run around the ends, and pass to the corners. The QB is a real scrambler so make sure not to over-commit on the pass rush." [CR]Cincinnati (NFL counterpart- Cincinnati Bengals): "This team can be beat with crisp short passes and runs up the middle. On offense, the QB is a real fighter. He gets good protection, and his running backs are quick and powerful." [CR]Atlanta (NFL counterpart- Atlanta Falcons): "They have a big pass rush, so you won't have much time to throw the ball. Watch out for their cornerbacks who have pure speed. You won't them deep, so throw the short stuff." Fair Teams [CR]Detroit (NFL counterpart- Detroit Lions): "They've got a running back who can fly, but their passing attack is weak. To beat this team, run around the ends, and pick apart their secondary with short passes." [CR]Cleveland (NFL counterpart- Cleveland Browns): "Tough up the middle, so get the ball into the secondary for big plays. The QB is smart and is a good leader, and the receivers have good hands." [CR]Denver (NFL counterpart- Denver Broncos): "Run right up the middle on these guys. The defense is weak and will give up a lot of points, but watch out for the hard-hitting secondary. Offensively, the QB can sting you with the long bomb." [CR]Tampa Bay (NFL counterpart- Tampa Bay Buccaneers): "Attack the right side of the defense with long passes. Stay away from the left side linebacker. Their veteran QB throws accurate passes to talented receivers.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Increase Odds[CR]When the game takes you to the coin selection screen,  choose Tails.

In each version of the game the player takes on the role of Dr Alan Grant and follows the events of the movie (and the book it is based on).[CR]There are numerous differences between the various versions. The titles on Nintendo's platforms were handled by Ocean Software while Sega's titles were developed by BlueSky Software.[CR]The 1993 Sega CD version, which is an a point and click adventure game rather than an action game, has a separate page here.[CR]Genesis Version[CR]A Tyrannosaurus breaks through the wall of the power plant.[CR]BlueSky's Genesis title is a 2D platformer which allowed the player to play as either Dr. Grant or a Velociraptor while they attempted to escape Isla Nublar. Since the game began development before the film had been completed the designers had to borrow heavily from the novel for stages. With additions like the pump station and river levels being ripped directly from the novel.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] when selecting Dr. Grant is a standard side-scrolling action platformer. As he attempts to escape the island he amasses an arsenal of non-lethal weapons such as darts, smoke grenades, and tasers. This character's series of levels leads him through locales such as a power plant, a river (where he pilots a motorboat), and the interior of an active volcano. Grant's finale sees him reaching the visitor's center and escaping the island via helicopter.The hunt continues.[CR]Opting to play as the Velociraptor gives the player access to a completely different arsenal, namely the raptor's claws. The raptor's main goals are to eventually defeat Dr. Grant and reach the mainland. Playing through each level will require the raptor to defeat armed guards still stationed on the island as well as other hostile dinosaurs. The raptor's campaign is noticeably shorter than Grant's, completely skipping levels such as the volcano and river. Completing the game as the raptor shows that it successfully escaped the island by concealing itself in a crate that is loaded into a cargo ship.[CR]After the successful sales of the Genesis version BlueSky released a sequel to Jurassic Park, Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition. The Master System and Game Gear versions of the game were similar to the Genesis version, but developed by Sega separately in Japan and didn't feature the raptor protagonist.[CR]SNES Version[CR]The SNES version of Jurassic Park is incredibly different from its Genesis counterpart. In the game the player controls Grant from a top down perspective and is given the task of collecting a number of velociraptor eggs before they hatch. Along with a much more cartoony and brighter look, it also has first-person indoor sections in the same vein as Doom where Grant has to collect key cards and codes for use outside.[CR]For the most part, the game is very open-ended, not unlike some earlier Zelda games. The game requires Grant to do a lot of backtracking and hunting for items which helps progress the player through the story. Unfortunately the game has no save or password function so the player would have to collect all of the eggs in one sitting, a very daunting task with lots of trial-and-error gameplay involved.[CR]Game Gear Version[CR]The Game Gear version has more in common with the Genesis version, being a side-scrolling shooter. With the only weapon being a pistol, the player once again assumes the role of Dr. Grant. Progression from level to level is non-linear, giving the player the option to choose which area of the island they want to tackle first. Before the actual side-scrolling segments of each zone the player would play through a vehicle segment. In these segments the player would shoot down dinosaurs pursuing the jeep, successfully clearing these levels granted bonuses. Each level is unique in its design, showcasing a different area of the island, complete with a boss fight at the end. Clearing all the selectable levels opened the Visitor Center finale, where Grant would be confronted by the park's Tyrannosaurus.[CR]Game Boy &amp; NES Versions[CR]The NES and Game Boy versions were basically the same game.[CR]Like the SNES Jurassic Park, the Game Boy and NES versions were also developed by Ocean Software. Also similar to the SNES version, the main goal of each stage is to simply collect a certain number of dinosaur eggs, opening access to the next area. Blocking progress through these stages is an assortment of dinosaurs, including main enemies like velociraptors, procompsognathus, and dilophosaurus. To deal with these threats, the player is given one primary weapon, bearing a strong resemblance to a rocket launcher. As Grant kills dinosaurs they drop ammunition for his armament. Interspersed between levels are boss encounters, including a sequence where the player is required to dodge stampeding triceratops, as well as a fight where Grant does battle with a Tyrannosaurus.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra health in the driving sequences.[CR]Your vehicle will regularly hit rocks as it drives across the roads.

Atari Games originally released it as a coin-op follow up to Tetris, which they were tangled in a legal dispute about at the time. Klax features a conveyor belt at the top of the screen which rolls toward the playing area, delivering a steady supply of colored blocks. The player controls a small device which sits at the interface between the conveyor belt and the playing area. By moving this left and right, the player can catch the blocks and deposit them in the playing area. Failure to catch any block results in it falling down the gap between the conveyor belt and playing area and one drop being used. Once all of the drops are used, the player is given a chance to continue. Otherwise, the game ends. (In the original coin-op, the game ends when all drops are used.)[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1991</releasedate>				<year>1991</year>				<genre>Action, Strategy</genre>				<studio>Tengen Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<videoid>P7bPauxmYKg</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2877</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570274-klax</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/klax</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/klax/3030-16455/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2877-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/55688-klax-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/208248-klax-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/133102-klax-sega-master-system-screenshot-it-is-the-nineties-and.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/133103-klax-sega-master-system-screenshot-klax.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/133106-klax-sega-master-system-screenshot-options-screen.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/133107-klax-sega-master-system-screenshot-wave-selection-screen.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/133109-klax-sega-master-system-screenshot-beginning-of-a-wave.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/133110-klax-sega-master-system-screenshot-wave-6-running.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/133105-klax-sega-master-system-screenshot-demo-mode-running.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2716468-klax001.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1987/1139866-klax_2.gif</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/1987/1139865-klax_1.gif</snapshot10>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2877.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Knightmare II - The Maze of Galious (Korea)">				<description>Knightmare II - The Maze of Galious (Korea)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FKnightmare%20II%20-%20The%20Maze%20of%20Galious%20%28Korea%29.zip" size="92465" />				<title_clean>Knightmare II - The Maze of Galious</title_clean>			</game>			<game name="Krusty's Fun House (Europe)">				<description>Krusty's Fun House (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FKrusty%27s%20Fun%20House%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="164251" />				<title_clean>Krusty's Fun House</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Krusty's Fun House (or Krusty's Super Fun House) is a puzzle game in which Krusty the Clown, of The Simpsons fame, is trying to eradicate all the rodents in his titular fun house. The goal is to convince the rats to march towards the machines that will eliminate them (staffed by Bart and Homer Simpson, as well as Krusty Show characters Sideshow Mel and Corporal Punishment) by using objects found in the vicinity. Like the Lemmings from the series of the same name, the rats will simply follow a set of rules defined by their programming and the player can use this to anticipate their actions and plan accordingly in order to trap them.[CR]The game was based on Audiogenic's earlier Amiga game Rat-Trap, which was licensed out to Acclaim so they could turn it into a The Simpsons licensed game. Acclaim published the game on almost every platform imaginable at the time, sub-licensing the home computer versions to Virgin Games.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]There are 5 levels you can open with codes, NA and EU codes are different.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All doors are open[CR]Enter the appropriate password to go to the desired level: </plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1992</releasedate>				<year>1993</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>2.3</rating>				<videoid>qLUEqBv6l7s</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2879</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588091-krustys-fun-house</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/krustys-fun-house</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/krustys-fun-house/3030-12321/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8899</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2879-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2879-1.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/49618-krusty-s-fun-house-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-story.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/49619-krusty-s-fun-house-sega-master-system-screenshot-hey-hey.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/49620-krusty-s-fun-house-sega-master-system-screenshot-krusty-hates.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/49621-krusty-s-fun-house-sega-master-system-screenshot-bart-s-machine.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/49622-krusty-s-fun-house-sega-master-system-screenshot-jumping.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/49623-krusty-s-fun-house-sega-master-system-screenshot-dazed.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/49624-krusty-s-fun-house-sega-master-system-screenshot-large-wall.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2694199-krustysuperfunhouse001.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/738158-1183826865_00.png</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/738155-1183827009_00.png</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2879-1.jpg</fanart1>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/32YMC9M.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Kujaku Ou (Japan)">				<description>Kujaku Ou (Japan)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FKujaku%20Ou%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="312472" />				<title_clean>Kujaku Ou</title_clean>				<plot>You are Kane, the SpellCaster warrior of Summit Temple.

The title of this version is Sapo Xul&#233;: O Mestre do Kung Fu, which means Sapo Xul&#233;: the Master of Kung Fu. Sapo Xul&#233; was a popular toy line in Brazil in the 1980's. This release was developed by Tec Toy.[CR]The Sapo Xul&#233; toy that the character was based off of is a frog wearing tennis shoes. The toy came with a satchel of a smelly substance that was placed in the shoes. The reason for this was that when the shoes were removed the feet were supposed to smell bad.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player can jump, leap off of walls, kick, and throw explosive talismans that are collected and powered up. Thugs, animals, and supernatural beings that the evil Madanda has released upon waking from his slumber must be defeated. The game plays as a side-scrolling platformer/beat-em-up, with an agile character that controls very tightly but has a limited move set.[CR]There are seven colorful levels of various lengths and difficulty including one level where the player must fight a series of new bosses in rapid succession. Most bosses follow predictable patterns. Talismans, talisman power-ups, health power-ups, and jugs of water that provide protection against fire-breathing enemies can be found when enemies are defeated or when specific hidden areas are discovered. Like most games of the era, the player is sent back to the beginning of a level upon death.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>1/1/1987</releasedate>				<year>1987</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Alt</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.5</rating>				<videoid>XO0CtSvcZA8</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2439</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588092-kung-fu-kid</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/kung-fu-kid</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/kung-fu-kid/3030-12779/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8584</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2439-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2439-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/130695-kung-fu-kid-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71933-kung-fu-kid-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/184801-kung-fu-kid-sega-master-system-screenshot-japanese-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71934-kung-fu-kid-sega-master-system-screenshot-get-ready.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71935-kung-fu-kid-sega-master-system-screenshot-round-1.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71936-kung-fu-kid-sega-master-system-screenshot-jumping.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71937-kung-fu-kid-sega-master-system-screenshot-dead.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71938-kung-fu-kid-sega-master-system-screenshot-in-the-bamboo-forest.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71939-kung-fu-kid-sega-master-system-screenshot-boss.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71940-kung-fu-kid-sega-master-system-screenshot-boss-hurt.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71941-kung-fu-kid-sega-master-system-screenshot-boss-trying-to-give.jpg</snapshot10>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/fMkmLPZ.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Land of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse (Europe)">				<description>Land of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FLand%20of%20Illusion%20Starring%20Mickey%20Mouse%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="308782" />				<title_clean>Land of Illusion Starring Mickey Mouse</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Land of Illusion starring Mickey Mouse (known in Japan as Mickey Mouse's Magic Crystal) is a 2D sidescrolling platformer developed and published by Sega for the Sega Master System (in 1992 for European regions only) and Sega Game Gear (in 1993).

A puzzle game that requires players to direct a group of green haired, blue-shirted, lemmings from point A to point B. The game is based on the myth that lemmings migrate in large groups and follow a single leader, who would often lead them off a cliff to their demise. In the game, lemmings constantly march in one direction unless they run into an obstacle, at which point they turn around and walk the other way. Being fearless and unaware of their own mortality, the lemmings will blindly run into fire, jump off cliffs, become crushed and fall victim to numerous other pitfalls.The player must command the lemmings to do certain tasks in order to complete each stage and get a certain percentage of lemmings to safety. These actions include digging, using a pick axe to dig diagonally, using their arms (windmill style) to punch horizontally through terrain and building staircases to traverse large gaps.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]All levels in Lemmings consist of at least one entrance, and at least one exit. The aim in each level is to safely get an allocated amount of lemmings towards an exit. Obstacles; such as water, deadly traps and great heights will hinder the lemmings' progress.There are 120 levels in total, split into four difficulty ratings - Fun, Tricky, Taxing, and Mayhem.[CR][B]Skills:[/B][CR]There are eight different skills available for the lemmings to carry out.

A puzzle game that requires players to direct a group of green haired, blue-shirted, lemmings from point A to point B. The game is based on the myth that lemmings migrate in large groups and follow a single leader, who would often lead them off a cliff to their demise. In the game, lemmings constantly march in one direction unless they run into an obstacle, at which point they turn around and walk the other way. Being fearless and unaware of their own mortality, the lemmings will blindly run into fire, jump off cliffs, become crushed and fall victim to numerous other pitfalls.The player must command the lemmings to do certain tasks in order to complete each stage and get a certain percentage of lemmings to safety. These actions include digging, using a pick axe to dig diagonally, using their arms (windmill style) to punch horizontally through terrain and building staircases to traverse large gaps.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]All levels in Lemmings consist of at least one entrance, and at least one exit. The aim in each level is to safely get an allocated amount of lemmings towards an exit. Obstacles; such as water, deadly traps and great heights will hinder the lemmings' progress.There are 120 levels in total, split into four difficulty ratings - Fun, Tricky, Taxing, and Mayhem.[CR][B]Skills:[/B][CR]There are eight different skills available for the lemmings to carry out. Each level has a different selection and amount of abilities available. Different situations require the use of different skills.Several lemmings using the 'floater' skill.The skills are:Climbers - Climbers will climb a vertical surface until they reach the end of the surface.Diggers - Diggers will dig downward vertically through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Miners - These will dig diagonally downward through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Bashers - Will dig horizontally through a wall made of any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Builders - Will build a 12 step stairway diagonally upwards.Blockers - Will stop walking and block the advances of other lemmings, causing them to reverse their course.Bombers - A countdown will appear above their head, counting from 5 to 0.

Soon he is hunted by disgruntled enemy soldiers who want their toy back. The game takes the players through six levels controlling Jack in an armoured jeep. The gameplay is shown through a top-down perspective, with the screen scrolling vertically at a constant rate. The jeep cannot access the top part of the screen, only two thirds of it and getting stuck behind certain objects blows up the jeep.[CR]The jeep is equipped with an unlimited amount of bullets and about 50 missiles per mission. Certain objects in the air can only be taken out using missiles. After launching them, players can apply "aftertouch" to guide towards the target by moving left or right. The settings, including a factory and a jungle, sometimes have obstacles, also requiring the jeep to jump over rivers. There are three difficulty levels, the vehicle can take multiple hits and there are three lives per continue.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]Using controller 2, hold down 1+2 as the screen with the gun appears, then press any button to access and use the sound test.Also activated is a stage select, stage skip and extra lives.

The game received highly positive rankings and was considered "one of the only good games based on a movie".[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is a linear platformer which has players going through level jumping, defeating enemies and solving an occasional light puzzle. On top of a classic style of jumping on enemies, Simba also has the ability to roar and cause different affects to foes. When Simba becomes an adult he gains the ability to slash and maul his foes. There is no save feature; losing all lives causes a restart of the game.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Players control Simba, a young lion cub who faces much adversary after the death of his father (Mufasa) from the hands of his uncle, Scar.

The object is to guide a marble through a maze, avoiding obstacles along the way. Marble Madness is well known for it's soundtrack and was the first arcade cabinet to include stereo sound. This was the first game to be released on Atari's System 1 hardware, which allowed arcade owners to convert a machine into another game with the changing of just a few different parts. The success of the game has led it to being ported to many systems such as the NES, Master System and the Commodore 64.Marble Madness, along with Archon and Deluxe Paint, were some of the first "killer apps" for the Amiga and greatly contributed to the system's initial appeal and sales.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]You think you can get the marble through this course? Madness!Marble Madness is played from an isometric third-person perspective. The object of the game is to maneuver a colored marble through several different courses in the constraints of a time limit. Each ends when the marble reaches an end goal (helpfully marked "GOAL"). The player's marble carried momentum and a rudimentary physics model provided most of the challenge, as it was easy to fall off the side of the narrow courses.Finishing a course adds the remaining time to the limit placed on the next course. In the original arcade release, the player used a trackball to control the movement of the marble. Later home versions changed the controls to a directional pad or other control mechanism.The marble can be destroyed by falling off the course or by simply dropping too far onto another platform. In the event that the marble is shattered in a fall, a cartoon broom will appear and sweep the broken pieces away before respawning the player's marble near by. While there was no "lives remaining" counter, each fall or death wasted valuable time. Courses were designed in a manner that made it extremely difficult to finish within the time limit if the player lost more than one or two marbles.As the game goes on, enemies and obstacles are introduced to the player to make course completion more difficult. The player will run into challenges like moving platforms, catapults, a black "enemy" marble that would attempt to ram the player off the course, and even a course that must be run uphill instead of downhill. An option is also included which allows two players to race each other down any of the courses at the same time.Races:Practice Race: The first course, shorter than the others.Beginner Race: Longer, but relatively less complicated than the later courses.Intermediate Race: Featuring moving green hills and moving pools of acid that will swallow the marble.Aeriel Race: Featuring narrower platforms.Silly Race: This is the course which must be run uphill instead of downhill.Ultimate Race: Featuring many of the obstacles from earlier in the game, making it the most difficult race of all.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]Go to options and set Test Fx to 2 and Test Music to 5.

Upon its release it was included with this professional target shooting simulator that allowed the player to shoot down clay pigeons (in Trap Shooting) and moving cardboard silhouette targets (in Marksman Shooting). The two games superficially resembled Duck Hunt and Hogan's Alley respectively.[CR]In the European-only mode Safari Hunt, the player could also shoot wild animals as they move across the screen. The creatures ranged from small fish and rabbits to larger beasts like bears, which required more than one shot to defeat. Defeated animals, rather than simply dying, tended to run off the screen with crosses through them to indicate they had been hit.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1986</releasedate>				<year>1986</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.2</rating>				<videoid>jX2o6tbxQ_M</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2897</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588098-marksman-shooting-and-trap-shooting</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/marksman-shooting-trap-shooting</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/marksman-shooting-trap-shooting/3030-4368/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2897-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/74402-marksman-shooting-trap-shooting-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/74403-marksman-shooting-trap-shooting-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/185209-marksman-shooting-trap-shooting-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/185210-marksman-shooting-trap-shooting-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/185211-marksman-shooting-trap-shooting-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/185212-marksman-shooting-trap-shooting-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/185213-marksman-shooting-trap-shooting-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/185214-marksman-shooting-trap-shooting-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/185215-marksman-shooting-trap-shooting-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/185216-marksman-shooting-trap-shooting-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/5/56971/2022047-marksman_shooting___trap_shooting_title.png</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/5/56971/2022046-marksman_shooting___trap_shooting_gameplay_4.png</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Marksman Shooting &amp; Trap Shooting &amp; Safari Hunt (Europe)">				<description>Marksman Shooting &amp; Trap Shooting &amp; Safari Hunt (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FMarksman%20Shooting%20%26%20Trap%20Shooting%20%26%20Safari%20Hunt%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="52267" />				<title_clean>Marksman Shooting &amp; Trap Shooting &amp; Safari Hunt</title_clean>				<plot>This cartridge bundles three games that all support the light phaser.

Though the title screen implies that Sega reprogrammed the game for the Master System from an earlier build for a different console, this version appears to the only version of Megumi Rescue. It requires the use of a paddle controller, sold separately.[CR]The goal of Megumi Rescue is to control a pair of firefighters holding a trampoline, while a third (and only partly controllable) firefighter bounces from the trampoline to catch civilians (and cats) high up in burning buildings. The player must ensure that not only the third firefighter and his rescuees survive, but also the people forced to jump from the building as the fire spreads, by moving the trampoline underneath them as they fall. It plays very much like the "catch the falling object" variant of Breakout popularized by games like the Atari 2600 game Kaboom!.[CR]The player can occasionally catch a break by finding the rescue helicopter or the gold key; in both these cases the fire is put out and the level is instantly won. There are 30 burning buildings in all to play through.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1988</releasedate>				<year>1988</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<rating>7.0</rating>				<videoid>mAj_D00kRrI</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2903</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570171-megumi-rescue</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/megumi-rescue</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/megumi-rescue/3030-40356/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2903-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/259959-megumi-rescue-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/259960-megumi-rescue-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/568455-megumi-rescue-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/568456-megumi-rescue-sega-master-system-screenshot-up-in-the-air.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/568457-megumi-rescue-sega-master-system-screenshot-on-to-the-next.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/568458-megumi-rescue-sega-master-system-screenshot-don-t-miss-the.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2359037-megumi_rescue__japan_000.png</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2359036-megumi_rescue__japan_001.png</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/d/0/gfs_8600_2_1.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/0/0/gfs_8600_2_2.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/b/0/gfs_8600_2_3.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/2/a/0/gfs_8600_2_4.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Mercs (Europe)">				<description>Mercs (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FMercs%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="222293" />				<title_clean>Mercs</title_clean>				<plot>Mercs is a shoot 'em up influenced by Ikari Warriors.

As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes.[CR]Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.[CR]Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.[CR]After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will receive his hammer.

Players select a character from a vast roster and race against CPU or human opponents; neither the races nor the cars the player finds himself in are related to the character. Each character has a CPU strength rating but there are zero differences between them when played by human players.[CR]Micro Machines is based on the toy line of the same name of very small collectible car models. To suit their miniature form, each course in the game is set in a region of a regular home: the kitchen table, a games room with a pool table, a garden, etc.[CR]Micro Machines was released on almost every console and home computer system available in 1994. It also saw a sequel: Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]One Player Mode[CR] Head-to-Head[CR]In this mode there are only two vehicles are in play: one player controlled and one AI. The objective is to gain enough distance between the opponent as to make him stay out of the screen, when this happens the car on screen is awarded a point from the opponent's pool (each player starts with 4 each). These points go back and forth until someone has all eight points or the race ends naturally after three laps.Challenge[CR]This mode places the player in 25 races against three other AI controlled vehicles. The player starts with a set number of lives, and loses them for each race where they don't place in the top two places. Once they run out of lives, they are eliminated. The AI characters are also eliminated and replaced by stronger opponents as they place badly through the races.[CR] Two Player ModeHead-to-Head[CR]This mode is the same as described in the "One Player" section, only both vehicles are human-controlled.[CR] Tournament[CR]In Tournament two players are pitted against each other in the same fashion as Head-to-Head for a series of five races and whoever wins most races out of the five is declared winner.[CR]Vehicles and Environments[CR]The type of vehicles change, and are fixed for each environment:[CR] Bathtub - Powerboats[CR]These are standard powerboats with standard handling. The Bathtub stages are relatively free of course hazards.[CR] [CR] [CR] Breakfast Table - Four by Four[CR]A four-by-four jeep like off-roader that controls well over rough terrain. The breakfast table is filled with food spills that the four-by-four has little trouble with.[CR] [CR] [CR] Desktop - Sportcars[CR]These convertible cars may be small but they do put out a fight with a high top speed and finicky handling. The Desktop environment has a lot of ramps and barricades.[CR] [CR] [CR] Worktop - Warriors[CR]A group of mean looking cars that look like they come right out of Mad Max. Decent handling and speed but are best suited for bumping each other off the course. The worktop is filled with tools and other impassable objects.Billiards Table - Formula One[CR]Formula One (or open-wheel) racecars, like in real life, sport extremely high top speeds on straights and high acceleration without a compromise on the corners. The billiards table naturally has a lot of pool balls and cues to get in the players' way.Sandbox - Turbo Wheels[CR]Dune buggy vehicles designed for the sandy terrain of the sandbox. Obstacles include buckets and spades.Garden - Choppers[CR]The helicopters have tricky turning cycles but are able to fly over all but the tallest obstacles in the garden course. [CR] Bedroom floor - Tanks[CR]Tanks are slow vehicles with poor turning but have the advantage of shooting one's opponent, forcing them to respawn behind the player's location. The goal of these stages is to stay ahead and elude the shots of those behind them. The bedroom floor stage is filled with toys and other obstacles to use as cover.Backyard - Rufftrux[CR]Huge monster trucks in a special time trial race. Fit through the obstacles to earn a 1up on this stage.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Although the player's character doesn't determine the racing characteristics of their vehicle, the computer A.I. of each character is different. Spider is notably a very fast opponent.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Game Modes[CR]Enter the following at the Title Screen:</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1993</releasedate>				<year>1993</year>				<genre>Driving, Racing</genre>				<studio>Codemasters Software Company Limited, The</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>				<rating>5.0</rating>				<videoid>4Y1vER3aVZw</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2915</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570293-micro-machines</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/micro-machines</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/micro-machines/3030-2140/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8289</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2915-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/103256-micro-machines-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/103271-micro-machines-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/105596-micro-machines-sega-master-system-screenshot-developers-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/105595-micro-machines-sega-master-system-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/105594-micro-machines-sega-master-system-screenshot-player-selection.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/105593-micro-machines-sega-master-system-screenshot-first-race-the.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/105592-micro-machines-sega-master-system-screenshot-desktop-drop.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/105591-micro-machines-sega-master-system-screenshot-oilcan-alley.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2771485-micromachines001.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/10/104355/1468405-screenshot.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7395/1253886-fonz.png</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/9408/746010-1134578573_00.gif</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Miracle Warriors - Seal of the Dark Lord (USA, Europe) (Beta)">				<description>Miracle Warriors - Seal of the Dark Lord (USA, Europe) (Beta)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FMiracle%20Warriors%20-%20Seal%20of%20the%20Dark%20Lord%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29%20%28Beta%29.zip" size="163666" />				<title_clean>Miracle Warriors - Seal of the Dark Lord</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story of Miracle Warriors takes place in the Five Lands. Long time ago, a young shepherd named Iason unknowingly opened the Pandora Passage. Through this passage the evil Lord Terarin and her horde of evil creatures were unleashed into the Five Lands.[CR]As he grew older, he saw what kind of evil he had brought upon the Five Lands, and vowed that he would defeat Terarin and restore peace to his world. Iason trained with the White Monks, learning the ways of the King's sword, and the magical dangers of Terarin's horde. After a long and difficult battle Iason managed to defeat Terarin and reseal the Pandora Passage. Before he returned to his life as a shepherd, Iason made the prophecy that one day Terarin would return, and four brave warriors would awake to meet her evil challenge.They may look like a 80s metal band, but they are here to battle evil.[CR]The game starts shortly after the second appearance from Terarin took place. After wandering through the Five Lands witnissing evil everywhere, the player character came to a castle where they learned of their destiny: The blood of Iason flows in their veins. So they set out on their quest to find three other warriors and defeat the evil Terarin.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Miracle Warriors is one of the first Japanese RPGs that made their way to Europe and America. Like many 8-bit RPGs, there is a considerable focus on grinding. The premise of Miracle Warriors is quite simple: The game begins with a single warrior with a name of the player's choosing, and the magical fairy Ica. She is in charge of all the messages which appear on screen.The beginning of the game. Alone with a fairy in the desert.[CR]On the upper left side the warrior and Ica are visible. There the player can also see which terrain they are currently in.[CR]On the upper right side the player can see which square on the world map they are located. The game included a map so that the player could not get too lost.[CR]The bottom left side shows the name of the warrior, their current experience and their health. The upper blue bar is the experience meter. As the characters battle creatures, their experience will grow turning the experience meter white. Once the experience meter becomes fully white, the character will gain a level and become stronger. This strength meter starts out white. As damage is incurred, the white will decrease. If the strength meter turns fully blue, the character will die.[CR]Lastly, on the right side is a list of the party's possessions. From top to bottom they are:Guilders. Guilders are the monetary units of the Five Lands. They are used to purchase weapons, herbs and special items.Herbs. Herbs are used to heal the party after battles.Fang. Fangs are valuable in the Five Lands. They can be sold for Guilders or traded for special items.Character Points. Character Points are evidence of the party's worthiness in battle. Many villages will bar the party from entering until a certain amount of Character Points are obtained.Game Menus[CR]At different points in the game, menus can be accessed with different options. When decisions need to be made, these menus appear automatically.[CR]In the basic menu it is possible to heal the party, use items or feathers (used to warp back to the town the feather was bought in), save the game and view the party's status.[CR]Item Screen[CR]On the item screen the player can see how many of the items are currently in their possession. They are as follows:These are the party's items.Nut: A magical attack item. The enemy takes damage and can not attack one round. It is possible to have a maximum of eleven at a time.Staff: Same as the nut, only stronger. Only four can be carried.Sphere: The most powerful of the magical attack items. Only one can be held at any point.Potion: The potion will restore one of the characters HP to the maximum.Stone: Prevents the enemy from using magic in a battle.Feather: Used to warp the party back to the town from where it was purchased.Helm: Can transcribe hieroglyphs in caves.Crystal: Provides superlative visibility inside dungeons, monuments and caves.Mantle: Weaker enemies are no longer able to see and attack the party.Mask: Lets the player see better in caves.The keys of Heaven (blue), Earth (green) and Hell (red) are needed to open the gates of Terarin's hiding place.Blacksmith: Will repair the party's equipment for free after he has been hired.Ships: Used to travel over water. There are two different ships.Scroll of Iason: Used to awaken the other companions.[CR]Status Screen[CR]The status screen can be accessed through the basic menu of the game.The status screen of the party.[CR]It shows the Attack Strength (S) and Defense Strength (D) of the party, as well as the weapons and armor currently in use.[CR]The number next to the item shows their condition. If it reaches zero, the item will break and has to be replaced. They can also be repaired by blacksmiths. Later in the game it is possible to find a blacksmith who travels alongside the party and will repair equipment automatically.[CR]Encounter MenuA fight against a thief. Easily identified by the horns and the fur underwear.[CR]This menu will automatically be displayed when the player comes into contact with a friend or a foe. Note that it is possible to attack friends as well as foes, but killing friendly people will result in a severe decrease in Character Points, preventing the party from entering certain towns anymore. Experience points can only be gained through attacking. They are not obtained for winning the battle. The problem is that the player can only attack with one of their characters per round. This makes leveling up a rather tedious process.[CR]There is also the option to retreat from the battle, although this is not always possible. It is possible to talk to the character, assuming he is friendly of course.[CR]It is possible to use magical items against certain foes or try to cast a spell. The manual of the game explains, though, that Iason never used spells in combat... for a reason. So, don't.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Exceed Potions/Sacred Nuts item limit[CR]Buy 20 potions, then use one to have 19. Now you can buy 5 more to have a limit of 24.

Since there is only one of each deed per game, trading with other places is pretty much vital to winning.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1987</releasedate>				<year>1988</year>				<genre>Strategy</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1-4 Alt</nplayers>				<perspective>Isometric</perspective>				<rating>2.7</rating>				<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>				<videoid>SupyOig75cA</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2921</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588106-monopoly</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/monopoly</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/monopoly/3030-2958/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8290</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2362073-nes_monopoly.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2921-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/150526-monopoly-windows-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/202811-monopoly-windows-media.jpg</boxart4>				<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/27971-monopoly-windows-media.jpg</boxart5>				<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/150522-monopoly-windows-media.jpg</boxart6>				<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/299048-monopoly-windows-media.jpg</boxart7>				<boxart8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/302312-monopoly-windows-media.jpg</boxart8>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8832-monopoly-windows-screenshot-intro-animation-showing-title-and.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8833-monopoly-windows-screenshot-choosing-number-of-players-names.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8834-monopoly-windows-screenshot-spinning-your-dice-using-animations.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8835-monopoly-windows-screenshot-chance-card.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8836-monopoly-windows-screenshot-music-sound-selection-every-property.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8837-monopoly-windows-screenshot-moving-on-the-board.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8838-monopoly-windows-screenshot-moving-on-the-board-is-set-to-be.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8839-monopoly-windows-screenshot-train-station-buy-it-or-leave-it.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8840-monopoly-windows-screenshot-arriving-at-the-oriental-avenue.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/8841-monopoly-windows-screenshot-card-statistics-and-tresspassing.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2921-1.jpg</fanart1>				<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/2921-g.jpg</banner1>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2921.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Montezuma's Revenge Featuring Panama Joe (USA)">				<description>Montezuma's Revenge Featuring Panama Joe (USA)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FMontezuma%27s%20Revenge%20Featuring%20Panama%20Joe%20%28USA%29.zip" size="50232" />				<title_clean>Montezuma's Revenge Featuring Panama Joe</title_clean>				<plot>You play as a treasure hunter named Panama Joe, whose goal is to find an ancient treasure hidden by Aztec warrior deep inside catacombs.

After initial popularity, it was ported to most fourth-generation consoles (in a special event known as "Mortal Monday").The game was controversial due to the combination of excessive gore and violence (including post-battle execution moves known as Fatalities) and fully-digitized character graphics, two concepts that were introduced to the fighting game genre by Mortal Kombat. Originally designed as a video game starring Jean-Claude Van Damme (whose likeness can be seen in the character Johnny Cage), the game introduced a monstrous franchise that spawned a multitude of sequels, a series of comic books, music CDs, a live tour, two television shows, and two major motion pictures (Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat Annihilation).The game revolves around the brutal Mortal Kombat tournament held in a hidden island ruled by the evil sorceror Shang Tsung (whose half-dragon, half-human bodyguard, Goro, remains the undefeated champion of the tournament). Each of the seven playable characters enter the tournament for different reasons (some for revenge, while others for glory). The main protagonist is Liu Kang, a Shaolin Monk of the White Lotus society who wants to bring honor back to the Mortal Kombat tournament. The main storyline was expanded through comics and sequels, involving the evil forces of Outworld, who use the tournament in order to take over Earth (known as Earthrealm).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade button layout in the classic "X" formation.Mortal Kombat plays like a traditional 2D fighting game. The 5-button layout was laid out in an "X" pattern and featured High Punch and Low Punch on the left, High Kick and Low Kick on the right, and a dedicated Block button (a first for 2D fighting games) in the middle. Depending on the distance and joystick position, players can perform uppercuts, roundhouse kicks, backhand punches, and leg sweeps. The game introduced special moves that do not require circular joystick movement or holding the joystick in a certain direction. Scorpion's trademark Spear Throw for instance is performed by tapping away from the opponent on the joystick twice, then pressing the low punch button. The game also introduced special moves that do not require any button presses, such as Raiden's Flying Torpedo, performed by tapping away from the opponent on the joystick twice, then tapping towards the opponent on the joystick once.This is the only fighting game in the franchise to include a scoring system (using points) for its high score table. Players earn points by damaging other players, winning a round, and winning the Test Your Might mini-game. The amount of points for winning the round is based on time, amount of damage taken (taking no damage in a round results in a Flawless Victory bonus, while taking no damage in the second round results in a Double Flawless bonus of 500,000 points), and whether or not the player performs a Fatality (which earns the player 100,000 points).FatalitiesFATALITY!One key feature of the fighting game genre made possible (and famous) by Mortal Kombat is the Fatality, which serves as a glorified finishing move that can only be performed upon a losing player at the end of the final round. Fatalities are special button and joystick combinations that are time-restricted. Failing to perform one usually results in the opponent falling unceremoniously to the ground, with the only penalty being a loss of the Fatality bonus. Goro, Shang Tsung, and Reptile do not perform Fatalities, and likewise players can not perform a Fatality on Goro or Shang Tsung. Other than The Pit Stage Fatality, performing a Fatality earns the player 100,000 points. In some home versions, Fatalities are referred to as "Finishing Moves".Simply performing an uppercut (or performing Liu Kang's Fatality) on The Pit will knock the opponent over the side of the bridge, who will then be impaled through the spikes below. This is not available in the Sega Genesis (without the Blood Code activated), Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, or Sega Master System versions.Test Your MightRaiden chopping a pile of wood for bonus points.Every three matches against the CPU opponent or every five matches against human opponents brings the player(s) to a mini-game called "Test Your Might", which requires each player to repeatedly tap certain buttons to build up a yellow bar (which quickly decreases). Once the bar reaches a certain point, the player presses another button to attempt to chop the object placed in front of them. The required point of breakage and points awarded for a successful chop is increased for each level. (100,000 points for Wood, 200,000 points for Stone, 500,000 points for Steel, 750,000 points for Ruby, and 1,000,000 points for Diamond)[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Character Selection Screen with player one as Kano and player two as Sub-Zero.The game includes seven playable characters and two bosses. After choosing a character, the player progresses through the game by defeating all seven combatants (including a mirror match), then progress through three "endurance matches" (in which players must defeat two opponents consecutively to win a round), and then battle the two bosses: Goro and Shang Tsung.Introduced in later versions of the arcade (and the home console ports) is the unplayable Reptile, the third ninja palette swap with moves of both Scorpion and Sub-Zero. He randomly appears before matches to provide clues on how to reach him. If the player can decipher these hints, they will know that Reptile can be fought by performing a Fatality on The Pit stage without taking damage or blocking in the final round, and even then he will only show himself if a shadow appears over the moon in the background at some point during the match. Defeating him earns the player 10,000,000 points.[CR]Johnny Cage[CR](not available in the Game Boy version)Actor: Daniel PesinaSpecial Moves[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Blood Code[CR]At the code of honour screen, press 2, 1, 2, Down, Up</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1993</releasedate>				<year>1993</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>Arena Entertainment</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>Side-Scrolling</perspective>				<rating>3.3</rating>				<videoid>ReiSJYQM88k</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2926</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/563496-mortal-kombat</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/mortal-kombat</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/mortal-kombat/3030-15743/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8291</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2926-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2926-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/119070-mortal-kombat-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71262-mortal-kombat-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71264-mortal-kombat-sega-master-system-screenshot-sub-zero-vs-liu.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71265-mortal-kombat-sega-master-system-screenshot-sub-zero-vs-rayden.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71266-mortal-kombat-sega-master-system-screenshot-sub-zero-vs-scorpion.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71267-mortal-kombat-sega-master-system-screenshot-sub-zero-vs-sonya.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71268-mortal-kombat-sega-master-system-screenshot-sub-zeros-freeze.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71270-mortal-kombat-sega-master-system-screenshot-sub-zeros-finishing.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71272-mortal-kombat-sega-master-system-screenshot-johnny-cage-vs.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71273-mortal-kombat-sega-master-system-screenshot-johnny-cages-finishing.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/71277-mortal-kombat-sega-master-system-screenshot-johnny-cages-finishing.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2926-1.jpg</fanart1>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2926.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Mortal Kombat 3 (Brazil)">				<description>Mortal Kombat 3 (Brazil)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FMortal%20Kombat%203%20%28Brazil%29.zip" size="270152" />				<title_clean>Mortal Kombat 3</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Raiden decides to take a vacation.[CR]Mortal Kombat 3 (known in some promotional material simply as MK3) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by  Midway on April 1995 for arcades.[CR]Although not as popular as the previous  Mortal Kombat games (and was criticized by fans due to the change of scenery and bland character roster), the game was a commercial success, adding new gameplay innovations to the franchise such as the Run button, different difficulty ladders, pre-programmed combos,  Animalities, mid-fight stage transitions, a new type of Fatality (the Animality) and special pre-match codes known as "Kombat Kodes". The game was later overshadowed by its upgrade:  Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.[CR]Taking place sometime after  Mortal Kombat II, the plot of Mortal Kombat 3 revolves around the  Outworld Emperor  Shao Kahn's invasion of  Earthrealm through the resurrection of his wife,  Sindel. Other sub-plots include the creation of the ninja clan  Lin Kuei's "cyber-assassin" program (in which  Sub-Zero refuses to join and becomes marked for death) and  Jax and  Sonya's hunt for the elusive  Kano.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Mortal Kombat "X" Control Panel with the new run button[CR]The gameplay in Mortal Kombat 3 builds upon the gameplay from the first two Mortal Kombat games. Along with four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, Low Kick) and a Block button, the game adds a Run button, which builds upon the offensive game by allowing the player to quickly dash forward. Along with this new button comes a "Run Meter", which limits the use of running.[CR]Mortal Kombat 3 introduces a "chain combo" system in which players can perform pre-programmed combos by linking normal attacks together. These combos cannot be escaped and usually end with either an attack that sends the opponent flying forward, or a launcher that allows the player to further juggle the opponent. Choose Your Destiny![CR]The game also introduces the concept of "Choose Your Destiny", a difficulty selection screen shown before the single player campaign where players can choose between different "towers", each increasing in difficulty. The difficulties included in Mortal Kombat 3 are Novice (in which the player fights six opponents), Warrior (in which the player fights eight opponents), and Master (in which the player fights ten opponents).[CR]In the versus screen before two-player matches, players can cooperatively enter a six-digit code (known as a "Kombat Kode") to modify key gameplay mechanics, fight hidden characters, and read hidden text messages. Gameplay mechanics that could be changed include disabling blocking, disabling throwing, disabling the Run Meter, changing the vitality of a player's life bar, making the screen pitch black, and forcing both players' characters to randomly change every few seconds.[CR]When the  Game Over screen appears after the sole player chooses not to continue, the player the option to enter a ten-digit secret code (known as an "Ultimate Kombat Kode"). Players have little time to input the code (either randomly or figured out through alternate sources). Only one working "Ultimate Kombat Kode" exists in Mortal Kombat 3: the ability to permanently unlock (for that arcade machine) Smoke as a playable character.Finishing MovesANIMALITY![CR] Fatalities,  Friendships, and  Babalities return from Mortal Kombat II. The requirements for performing Friendships and Babalities are now less restrictive (and can only be performed when the player does not press Block during that player's winning round).[CR]Introduced in Mortal Kombat 3 are Mercies and  Animalities. When a player has won a match that went to three rounds, the player has the option to prolong the fight with a special Mercy button combination. (Holding the Run button and pressing Down on the joystick four times when the character is at least a half a screen away) If the player defeats the opponent after showing Mercy, that player has the option to perform an Animality, in which the player transforms into a different animal and kills the opponent. (In a similar fashion to Liu Kang's Dragon Fatality from Mortal Kombat II).[CR]Characters and Actors[CR] The fifteen playable characters (including the space reserved for Smoke)[CR]The game includes fourteen playable starter characters, two unplayable bosses, one playable secret character, and one unplayable secret opponent. Jax, Kung Lao, Liu Kang, Sub-Zero, and Shang Tsung return from Mortal Kombat II alongside Kano and Sonya from the original Mortal Kombat as starting playable characters. Each character from the previous games have a different appearance, such as Jax's metal arms and an un-masked Sub-Zero. Shao Kahn returns from Mortal Kombat II as the game's final boss.[CR]The other playable starter characters include the  palette swaps Cyrax and Sektor (Lin Kuei cyber-assassins sent to kill Sub-Zero), Kabal (a former warrior of Kano's clan), Nightwolf (a North American  shaman), Stryker (a  riot control officer), Sheeva (a female  Shokan warrior), and the resurrected Sindel. Motaro replaces  Kintaro as Shao Kahn's bodyguard and penultimate boss.[CR]The game includes two secret characters, one of which (Smoke from Mortal Kombat II as an indoctrinated cyber-assassin palette swap) is unlocked as a playable character via an "Ultimate Kombat Kode". The other, Noob Saibot (also from Mortal Kombat II), can only be fought through a special "Kombat Kode". Although we're given the impression that Noob Saibot is a ninja (similar to Mortal Kombat II), he is simply a palette swap of Kano in this game. Shang Tsung - John Turk Sindel - Lia Montelongo Jax - John Parrish Kano - Richard Divizio Liu Kang - Eddie Wong Sonya - Kerri Hoskins Stryker - Michael O'Brien Smoke - Sal Divita (secret character) Sub-Zero - John Turk Cyrax - Sal Divita Sektor - Sal Divita Nightwolf - Sal Divita Sheeva - Stop-motion miniature Kung Lao - Anthony Marquez Kabal - Richard Divizio Motaro - Stop-motion miniature (boss, unplayable) Shao Kahn - Brian Glynn (final boss, unplayable) Noob Saibot - Richard Divizio (secret opponent, unplayable)Arenas[CR]There are eleven playable stages (thirteen if Noob Saibot's Dorfen is counted, where the player fights Noob Saibot, and Hidden Portal, where they fight Smoke), which is built into a simple, looping rotation. However, The Balcony is always the stage in Motaro matches and The Pit 3 is always the stage in Shao Kahn matches. The stages that include Stage Fatalities are The Subway (in which the player uppercuts the opponent into the adjacent tracks, who gets run over by a subway car), The Bell Tower (in which the player uppercuts the opponent down the Bell Tower through many floors, who then gets impaled by spikes), and The Pit 3 (in which the player uppercuts the opponent over the side of the bridge and into rotating blades below).[CR]A new addition to Mortal Kombat stages is mid-match stage transitions, where a simple uppercut can knock the opponent up into another stage. The Subway transitions to The Street, The Bank transitions to The Rooftop, and The Soul Chamber transitions to The Balcony. The Subway  The Bank The Street The Graveyard  The Rooftop The Balcony The Bridge The Soul Chamber The Bell Tower The Church The Graveyard The Pit 3[CR]Versions and Ports[CR]16-bit conversions for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo were released on September 8, 1995, along with a Game Boy version as well. A rare Game Gear version of MK3 was made but only saw a release in Japan and Europe. MK3 was an early member of the Sony PlayStation library, as a 32-bit conversion was released on October 7, 1995, less than a month after the PlayStation launched in North America. As part of its battle with Sega Saturn over the 32-bit market, Sony bought exclusive rights from Midway to release the game on 32-bit consoles. As a response, Sega purchased exclusive 32-bit rights to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Two versions of MK3 were released for PC. One version was strictly made for DOS. The other version was the PlayStation version ported over for Windows. An emulated version of the game was included on Midway Arcade Teasures 2 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube in 2004. It also was featured on Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play for the PSP in 2005 and Midway Arcade Teasures Deluxe Edition for the PC in 2006. Deluxe featured a 1995 10-minute documentary about the making of the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Dark Kombat[CR]At the Kombat Code screen, press [B]Up[/B] eight times, [B]Right[/B] eight times, [B]Left[/B] six times, [B]Down[/B] four times, the punch button twice, and the kick button twice.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Dark Kombat[CR]At the Kombat Code screen, press [B]Up[/B] twice, and the punch button twice.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Dark Kombat[CR]At the Kombat Code screen, press [B]Left[/B] nine times, [B]Up[/B] eight times, [B]Right[/B] seven times, the kick button thrice, the punch button twice, and [B]Down[/B] once.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Dark Kombat[CR]At the Kombat Code screen, press [B]Left[/B] once, and [B]Down[/B] once.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Dark Kombat[CR]At the Kombat Code screen, press	Left seven times, Up six times, Right nine times, Down three times, punch four times, kick twice.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Dark Kombat[CR]At the Kombat Code screen, press Up three times, Right three times, Down five times, punch six times, kick four times.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Dark Kombat[CR]At the Kombat Code screen, press Left twice, Right five times, Down twice, kick five times.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Dark Kombat[CR]At the Kombat Code screen, press [B]Up[/B] thrice, and [B]Right[/B] thrice.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Dark Kombat[CR]At the Kombat Code screen, press the punch button thrice, and the kick button thrice.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Dark Kombat[CR]At the Kombat Code screen, press Left seven times, Up eight times, Right three times, Down three times, punch four times, kick three times.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Dark Kombat[CR]At the Kombat Code screen, press [B]Left[/B] nine times, [B]Up[/B] eight times, [B]Right[/B] five times, the kick button five times, the punch button twice, and [B]Down[/B] once.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Dark Kombat[CR]At the Kombat Code screen, press [B]Left[/B] seven times, and [B]Right[/B] seven times.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Dark Kombat[CR]At the Kombat Code screen, press [B]Down[/B] seven times, and the kick button seven times.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Dark Kombat[CR]At the Kombat Code screen, press [B]Up[/B] nine times, the kick button four times, the punch button thrice, [B]Right[/B] twice, [B]Down[/B] twice, and [B]Left[/B] once.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Dark Kombat[CR]At the Kombat Code screen, press [B]Up[/B] six times, [B]Right[/B] six times, the punch button six times, the kick button six times, [B]Left[/B] four times, and [B]Down[/B] four times.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1996</releasedate>				<year>1996</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>Tec Toy Indstria de Brinquedos S.A.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.2</rating>				<ESRB>M -

The first version of Ms. Pac-Man was created in 1981 by a handful of programmers at General Computer Corporation. The programmers took a Pac-Man cabinet and modified it, calling it Crazy Otto.[CR]The programmers showed it to Midway who were both surprised at the quality of Crazy Otto and were getting upset over the long wait between the original Pac-Man and its sequel. Midway bought the rights for Crazy Otto and added the Pac-Man sprites and iconic name Ms. Pac-Man to the previously bootlegged game.[CR]Namco quickly took note of Ms. Pac-Man's swiftly growing popularity. Midway had not received consent from Namco to publish the game and a legal battle was about to erupt. Fearing a case would be brought against them, Midway and GCC turned over the rights for Ms. Pac-Man to Namco. Afterward, Namco created numerous ports for the home consoles while benefiting from the widely popular arcade game that was quickly becoming a cultural phenomenon in its own right.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ms. Pac-Man's gameplay does not stray much from Pac-Man's simple mechanics of eating pellets, numerous types of fruit, and power pellets to eat ghosts. However there are a few major changes that would change the gameplay experience between both games.The first such change is that the three intermissions in the game are changed to tell the story of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man's relationship from dating all the way to a stork dropping off their baby.The second change is a minor one; the changing of the orange ghost's name from Clyde to Sue.The ghosts now have movements that are semi-random. Because of this, many players have learned to use a set of moves to avoid the ghosts.The fruit no longer appears and stays in the center of the maze. It instead enters from one tunnel of the maze, travels around, and leaves through the other tunnel if not eaten by the player.The fruit order is now cherries, strawberry, orange, pear, apple, pretzel, and banana. The score for each is also 100, 200, 500, 700, 1000, 2000, and 5000 respectively.The final change is that there are six different mazes. With each of the mazes there are four different colors or styles. Each maze also now has two warp tunnels that will transport the player to the opposite side of the maze.The walls are now filled in (Pac-Man had hollow walls).[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1991</releasedate>				<year>1991</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>Tengen Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>				<rating>3.7</rating>				<videoid>ajwwcVhoXRY</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2932</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570273-ms-pac-man</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/ms-pac-man</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/ms-pac-man/3030-6332/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2932-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2932-1.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60373-ms-pac-man-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60374-ms-pac-man-sega-master-system-screenshot-meet-the-characters.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60375-ms-pac-man-sega-master-system-screenshot-meet-the-characters.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60376-ms-pac-man-sega-master-system-screenshot-meet-the-characters.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60377-ms-pac-man-sega-master-system-screenshot-meet-the-characters.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60378-ms-pac-man-sega-master-system-screenshot-meet-the-characters.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60379-ms-pac-man-sega-master-system-screenshot-options.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60380-ms-pac-man-sega-master-system-screenshot-level-1.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60381-ms-pac-man-sega-master-system-screenshot-you-can-chomp-ghosts.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60382-ms-pac-man-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-score-bar.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2932-1.jpg</fanart1>				<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2932-2.jpg</fanart2>				<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/2932-g.jpg</banner1>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2932.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="My Hero (USA, Europe)">				<description>My Hero (USA, Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FMy%20Hero%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" size="23119" />				<title_clean>My Hero</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]My Hero is an early era side scrolling brawler developed by Coreland, a contractor to Sega of Japan's arcade division at the time. It is known by the name Seishun Scandal in Japan and first saw release for the arcades in 1985, with a Master System home console version arriving the following year.[CR]Both versions allow for two players, however players must alternate turns and there are no opportunities for co-op play. The game is often regarded as a crude early entry into the 2D brawler genre and was a modest commercial success upon release. My Hero also enjoys the novelty of being available on the secondary Sega Card format for the Master System.[CR]Story and Gameplay[CR]From the 1986 Sega Master System release[CR]A brief opening scene shows the hero and his girlfriend assaulted by oncoming bandits, resulting in a kidnapping for the girl and ample side-scrolling action motivation for the boy.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] consists of the player utilizing crouching and jumping kicks, along with a forward punch, to move the protagonist onward past enemies and obstacles. Henchmen will approach from both the left and right sides of the screen, often brandishing weapons. Individual stages scroll between cityscapes that feature large numbers of enemies, including bottle and knife throwers, to platform heavy segments with less opponents but a unique set obstacles including flinging bombs, charging pigs and fire pits.[CR]At the end of each stage a boss battle occurs against the assailant under a sunset backdrop, 10 hit points apiece. After defeat the deviant will take the hero's girlfriend once again and the next stage begins. New stages introduce new foes, and there are three stages in total.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack for My Hero takes musical cues from Russian dance and traditional Hasidic Klezmer. It features a main theme that switches from C# minor to C# major every 8 measures. Additional themes are present during boss battles and story sequences.[CR]Ported to the Sega Master System[CR]My Hero holds a distinction as being one of the few titles released in the secondary Sega Card format, and it has the box art to prove it.[CR]There are a number of differences between the original 1985 Arcade release and 1986 Sega Master System port, including:From the 1985 Arcade releaseDefeated henchmen turn into small angels and fly away in the arcade release; on SMS they fly away using the same character model.Shops in the repeating city backdrop are more definable in the Arcade release, with some displaying text (Books, Games, Coffee/Snacks).The color of the sky has been changed from blue to green on SMS.Graphics are noticeably downgraded overall on the SMS.[CR]There are currently no known plans by either Nintendo or Sega to make My Hero available as a downloadable title on the Wii Virtual Console at this time.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1986</releasedate>				<year>1986</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>2.4</rating>				<videoid>PGi7yHlXBmM</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2936</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588108-my-hero</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/my-hero</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/my-hero/3030-9602/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8586</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2936-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2936-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/103270-my-hero-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/191205-my-hero-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/301135-my-hero-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart5>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/140596-my-hero-sega-master-system-screenshot-japanese-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66975-my-hero-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66976-my-hero-sega-master-system-screenshot-flying-kick.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/66977-my-hero-sega-master-system-screenshot-avoid-the-bottles-thrown.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2728589-0617342127-hjQjxFyA.png+</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2728588-6481052619-HqWDV4qp.png+</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2728587-7051432050-dp30p.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2728586-0313707107-klRUpMvk.png+</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/500/2442063-myhero-1265309988.png</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1295525-myhero_003.png</snapshot10>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/4dZfRUj.png</banner1>			</game>			<game name="NBA Jam (Europe) (Proto)">				<description>NBA Jam (Europe) (Proto)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FNBA%20Jam%20%28Europe%29%20%28Proto%29.zip" size="233681" />				<title_clean>NBA Jam</title_clean>				<plot>YOU control the super moves, amazing blocks and awesome slam dunks of the NBA's hottest stars!

The player controls the kiwi bird Tiki and must rescue his fellow kiwis, including his girlfriend Phee-Phee, from the villainous Willy Walrus. Kiwis can be found at the end of each stage, which the player must progress through with a mix of platforming, vehicle sequences and shooting enemies with bolts to remove them.[CR]The computer ports were published by UK company Ocean Software, which also published the NES game in Europe. The North American NES release was named Kiwi Kraze instead. It also saw a Japan-exclusive PC Engine port that would later be added to the Wii's Virtual Console (also Japan only). The Arcade version of The New Zealand Story was also added to the 2005 Taito Legends compilation.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story of The New Zealand Story takes place in the Zoological Garden of New Zealand's North Island. The two kiwis Tiki and his girlfriend Phee-Phee live happily together with the rest of the colony, until one day Wally Walrus comes to town. Wally captures the defenseless kiwis and carries them off to cages hidden in zoos and parks all over New Zealand. Trapped, they can only await their fate of being eaten by the Walrus![CR]Luckily, while Wally is busy thinking about kiwi meals, Tiki manages to escape from his cage and plans to save his girlfriend Phee-Phee and the rest of the colony. A race against time begins as Tiki battles with Wally's friends in the maze-like worlds of New Zealand's zoos, so that he can finally reach the evil Walrus and save his friends.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Lives, Continues and Scoring[CR]Tiki starts the game with three lives. He can get a bonus life at 50,000 points and every additional 20,000 points after that. Tiki loses a life when he is hit or when he runs out of oxygen. The player does not have to start the level from the beginning, though. They can resume the game directly where Tiki died. At the beginning of the game the player does not have any continues, but after completing stage 2-4 and 4-5 they are awarded a continue.[CR]Each time Tiki destroys an enemy the player gains 150 points. Additionally, enemies drop bonuses after being defeated. The bonus items are worth 100 extra points and in some cases Tiki also gets a special power from them.[CR]Bonus items include:Fruit: These only give 100 extra pointsWeapons: Bow and Arrow, Bomb, Laser Gun, Plasma Ball.Joystick: This one is only useful for riding balloons. It allows the player to control the balloon in a more sophisticated way than they normally can. It allows Tiki to stay in mid-air (normally the only options are to go either up or down) and change the direction left, right, up and down.Book: The book immediately destroys all enemies on-screen.Potion: The potion grants Tiki temporal invincibility.Stopwatch: All enemies are immobilized for a limited amount of time.Movement[CR]Tiki has four basic abilities: he can shoot his bow, walk, jump and swim.[CR]Jumping can be alternated in height by holding down the button longer or shorter.[CR]When swimming, Tiki only has a limited supply of oxygen. He can attack enemies from the water when coming up for air by squirting water at them.[CR]Tiki is furthermore able to fly with the help of balloons. Balloons can be found scattered around the levels or he can steal them from enemies. There are six different kinds of balloons in total. Each of them has different characteristics.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]There are 21 levels in total. All the levels are set in real life locations in New Zealand.[CR]The game begins in Auckland, then passes through Rotorua, The Waitomo Caves, Wellington Strait, Cook Strait and Hammer Springs to the final confrontation with Wally at Mount Cook. In every level Tiki has to save one of his kiwi friends, until he finally reaches his girlfriend Phee-Phee. The enemies, however, are not the only problem: There is a time limit for every level. If the player is too slow the Time Dragon will descend.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1992</releasedate>				<year>1992</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>Taito Corporation</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.2</rating>				<videoid>AwPx04CtgtM</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3066</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570242-the-new-zealand-story</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/new-zealand-story</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-new-zealand-story/3030-20020/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8334</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3066-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3066-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/282033-the-new-zealand-story-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60272-the-new-zealand-story-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60273-the-new-zealand-story-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-kiwis.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60274-the-new-zealand-story-sega-master-system-screenshot-only-to.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60275-the-new-zealand-story-sega-master-system-screenshot-level-1.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60276-the-new-zealand-story-sega-master-system-screenshot-don-t-waste.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60277-the-new-zealand-story-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-kiwi.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60278-the-new-zealand-story-sega-master-system-screenshot-map-of.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60279-the-new-zealand-story-sega-master-system-screenshot-level-1.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60280-the-new-zealand-story-sega-master-system-screenshot-watch-out.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/60281-the-new-zealand-story-sega-master-system-screenshot-level-1.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3066-1.jpg</fanart1>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/FxFCeyr.png</banner1>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/3066.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Ninja (Japan)">				<description>Ninja (Japan)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FNinja%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="75145" />				<title_clean>Ninja</title_clean>				<plot>Early in Japan's edo era, circa 1630, peace had continued in the western province of Ohkami until the feudal lord passed away. Gyokuro, an evil emperor, gained power and his oppressive rule caused great hardship to the people, and the princess who opposed him was confined to a dungeon somewhere in the Ohkami castle. Gyokuro has the Ohkami ninja under control at his command. Utilizing various ninjitsu techniques, in addition to the one that transforms them into a wolf, they protect him from the people who are his enemies.[CR]You play Kazamuru, a great warrior who challenges the clan to a fight in order to rescue the princess. However, he can't rescue the princess unless he finds the five scrolls in the thirteen areas of Ohkami. On his quest, he must defeat various ninjas such as Kuno-ichi and Ninniku, as well as fire-blowing ninjas, slashing ninjas, and footloose ninjas. You'll explore grassy fields, shrines, river banks,  towns, and the castle itself. Some of the steps have varied gameplay. For example, you must avoid boulders in Step 2, must use logs in order to cross a river in Step 5, avoid being trampled on by horses in Step 7, and scale a cliff in Step 9.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Free continue (Japanese version only)[CR]At the game over screen, wait for the Sega Mark III logo to appear.

It was renowned for its innovation of being the first game to use cinematic cutscenes to narrate its story (a presentation style that Tecmo dubbed "Tecmo Theater"). It was also well-known for being insanely hard. The story centers around Ryu Hayabusa, a ninja who comes to America to take revenge of his father's death, but soon uncovers a sinister plot threatening the entire world. It was released as Ninja Ryukenden in Japan and Shadow Warriors in Europe.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]One of the many cutscenes that the game is famous for.The game begins with a duel between Ken Hayabusa (Ryu Hayabusa's father) and another unnamed ninja. Ken is murdered, and shortly thereafter, Ryu finds a letter from his father. The letter tells him to search out the archeologist Walter Smith. After making it to America, however, Ryu is quickly captured by a young woman who proceeds to give him a demon statue. It is later revealed that bringing this demon statue to the other one similar to it would summon an ancient demon, and would be sure death for every living thing.Walter, commanding Ryu to chase after the ninja who stole the statueAfter finding Walter, Walter reveals many things to Ryu, such as the relationship between the Light and Shadow demon statues. However, during their conversation, a ninja jumps into Walter's home and steals the Shadow statue. Ryu pursues him, and manages to retrieve the statue, but upon returning finds Walter murdered, and the Light statue stolen.Ryu is then confronted by three armed men, who bring Ryu to an interrogation room. A man named Foster begins to explain to Ryu that his intelligence unit has been monitoring a man named Guardia de Mieux (also known as The Jaquio). Apparently he wants to summon the ancient demon. Foster requests that Ryu travels to South America to eliminate The Jaquio and his followers.Upon reaching the temple, it is discovered that The Jaquio has kidnapped Irene Lew, the young woman seen earlier in the game. The Jaquio offers her safety in return for the Shadow statue. Ryu hands over the Shadow statue, but a trap-door opens and Ryu falls into the low levels of the temple. After making his way back to the top, he finds that his father is still alive, but is possessed by a demon. Upon defeating the demon, The Jaquio is enraged, and proceeds to fire a magical attack at Ryu. Ken jumps in the way to protect his son. Presumably, The Jaquio dies in the ensuing fight. After the fight is over, the two statues form into the powerful demon, whom Ryu destroys.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]An easier momentNinja Gaiden features fast-paced action-platforming. Ryu must traverse a stage filled with various enemies, whom he must dispatch with his sword. Enemies are usually located in hard-to-dodge places--especially in the later levels. After defeating all of the foes within the level, Ryu will make it to a boss (whose health meter is next to Ryu's throughout the level). Typically, there is no secret to destroying the boss, its attacks are just incredibly hard to dodge making it very difficult for players who have lost health in other parts of the level. Because of this, it will normally take several playthroughs of a level - and memorization of enemies' locations are key.One of the game's many bossesRyu also has various power-ups to aid him. For example, one gives him the ability to do a spin-attack when he jumps. This ability, known as Jump &amp; Slash made some boss fights too easy. It is possible to destroy the Kelbeross boss in a single hit, and to destroy the Bomberhead boss' chain weapon with it. This may have been a contributing factor to Jump &amp; Slash's omission from Ninja Gaiden 2. There are also items that merely increase the player's score by different amounts.

It was renowned for its innovation of being the first game to use cinematic cutscenes to narrate its story (a presentation style that Tecmo dubbed "Tecmo Theater"). It was also well-known for being insanely hard. The story centers around Ryu Hayabusa, a ninja who comes to America to take revenge of his father's death, but soon uncovers a sinister plot threatening the entire world. It was released as Ninja Ryukenden in Japan and Shadow Warriors in Europe.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]One of the many cutscenes that the game is famous for.The game begins with a duel between Ken Hayabusa (Ryu Hayabusa's father) and another unnamed ninja. Ken is murdered, and shortly thereafter, Ryu finds a letter from his father. The letter tells him to search out the archeologist Walter Smith. After making it to America, however, Ryu is quickly captured by a young woman who proceeds to give him a demon statue. It is later revealed that bringing this demon statue to the other one similar to it would summon an ancient demon, and would be sure death for every living thing.Walter, commanding Ryu to chase after the ninja who stole the statueAfter finding Walter, Walter reveals many things to Ryu, such as the relationship between the Light and Shadow demon statues. However, during their conversation, a ninja jumps into Walter's home and steals the Shadow statue. Ryu pursues him, and manages to retrieve the statue, but upon returning finds Walter murdered, and the Light statue stolen.Ryu is then confronted by three armed men, who bring Ryu to an interrogation room. A man named Foster begins to explain to Ryu that his intelligence unit has been monitoring a man named Guardia de Mieux (also known as The Jaquio). Apparently he wants to summon the ancient demon. Foster requests that Ryu travels to South America to eliminate The Jaquio and his followers.Upon reaching the temple, it is discovered that The Jaquio has kidnapped Irene Lew, the young woman seen earlier in the game. The Jaquio offers her safety in return for the Shadow statue. Ryu hands over the Shadow statue, but a trap-door opens and Ryu falls into the low levels of the temple. After making his way back to the top, he finds that his father is still alive, but is possessed by a demon. Upon defeating the demon, The Jaquio is enraged, and proceeds to fire a magical attack at Ryu. Ken jumps in the way to protect his son. Presumably, The Jaquio dies in the ensuing fight. After the fight is over, the two statues form into the powerful demon, whom Ryu destroys.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]An easier momentNinja Gaiden features fast-paced action-platforming. Ryu must traverse a stage filled with various enemies, whom he must dispatch with his sword. Enemies are usually located in hard-to-dodge places--especially in the later levels. After defeating all of the foes within the level, Ryu will make it to a boss (whose health meter is next to Ryu's throughout the level). Typically, there is no secret to destroying the boss, its attacks are just incredibly hard to dodge making it very difficult for players who have lost health in other parts of the level. Because of this, it will normally take several playthroughs of a level - and memorization of enemies' locations are key.One of the game's many bossesRyu also has various power-ups to aid him. For example, one gives him the ability to do a spin-attack when he jumps. This ability, known as Jump &amp; Slash made some boss fights too easy. It is possible to destroy the Kelbeross boss in a single hit, and to destroy the Bomberhead boss' chain weapon with it. This may have been a contributing factor to Jump &amp; Slash's omission from Ninja Gaiden 2. There are also items that merely increase the player's score by different amounts. A very rare health powerup (occurring only two or three times throughout the game) that refills six empty health bars.A glitch has been uncovered that allows the player to repeatedly attack in mid-air. To activate the glitch, the player must jump into the air and then press the attack button several times. This is an incredibly useful technique against bosses and more difficult enemies.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Mode[CR]On the Main Menu, while Press Start is blinking, hold Down on controller 2 and hold Up on controller 1; then hold both buttons 1+2 on both controllers.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]At the password screen, enter one of the following codes for the desired effect:</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1992</releasedate>				<year>1992</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>4.6</rating>				<videoid>gWo-Lm0FQZo</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2942</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588110-ninja-gaiden</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/ninja-gaiden_</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/ninja-gaiden/3030-1653/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10747</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2344291-ninja.png</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2942-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164668-ninja-gaiden-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134492-ninja-gaiden-sega-master-system-screenshot-intro-part-1.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134493-ninja-gaiden-sega-master-system-screenshot-intro-part-2.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134494-ninja-gaiden-sega-master-system-screenshot-intro-part-3.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134495-ninja-gaiden-sega-master-system-screenshot-intro-part-4.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134496-ninja-gaiden-sega-master-system-screenshot-intro-part-4.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134497-ninja-gaiden-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134498-ninja-gaiden-sega-master-system-screenshot-start-of-chapter.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134499-ninja-gaiden-sega-master-system-screenshot-chapter-1-intro.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134500-ninja-gaiden-sega-master-system-screenshot-ryu-is-in-the-forest.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/134501-ninja-gaiden-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-green-ninjas.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2942-1.jpg</fanart1>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/Wg9xT1u.png</banner1>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2942.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Ninja, The (USA, Europe)">				<description>Ninja, The (USA, Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FNinja%2C%20The%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" size="80226" />				<title_clean>Ninja, The</title_clean>				<plot>Early in Japan's edo era, circa 1630, peace had continued in the western province of Ohkami until the feudal lord passed away. Gyokuro, an evil emperor, gained power and his oppressive rule caused great hardship to the people, and the princess who opposed him was confined to a dungeon somewhere in the Ohkami castle. Gyokuro has the Ohkami ninja under control at his command. Utilizing various ninjitsu techniques, in addition to the one that transforms them into a wolf, they protect him from the people who are his enemies.[CR]You play Kazamuru, a great warrior who challenges the clan to a fight in order to rescue the princess.

Through a series of missions, you'll engage a variety of enemies, from soldiers to ninjas, patrol boats to helicopters, and more. Can you carry the day?[CR]Operation Wolf is an arcade conversion of the game by Taito. It is essentially a bitmapped "rail-shooter", where you basically hold the gun and shoot just about everything that moves, while conserving your ammo and grenades. Shoot ammo/grenades and healing items on the screen to "pick them up". Your primary machine gun can kill everything if you hit it enough times, but you can also use the grenade launcher for really deadly targets like helicopters or armored cars. You can collect a machine gun which will allow you to shoot faster for a few seconds. [CR]You'll be pummelled by a LOT of enemies. Some will be shooting, others will be tossing grenades, knifes, and more. Some are armored and requires more than a few hits, others dodges. You can shoot grenades and knifes out of the air if you aim well enough. There are also civilians running around which can be shot, but it's not beneficial. [CR]Bosses appear at the end of some levels, and each has a specific weakness you need to exploit.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>				<year>1990</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>Taito Corporation</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>				<videoid>cQGi02baHf8</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2946</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570202-operation-wolf</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/operation-wolf</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/operation-wolf/3030-14869/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2946-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2946-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/117964-operation-wolf-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213321-operation-wolf-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213322-operation-wolf-sega-master-system-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213323-operation-wolf-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-levels-that.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213324-operation-wolf-sega-master-system-screenshot-okay-whatever.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213325-operation-wolf-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-beginning.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/3568/521271-operationwolf_nes_00.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/3568/521270-operationwolf_nes_01.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/5911/503732-sms_operationwolf.gif</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/431/353969-1.gif</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/431/353967-8.gif</snapshot10>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2946.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Ottifants, The (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It)">				<description>Ottifants, The (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FOttifants%2C%20The%20%28Europe%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29.zip" size="111287" />				<title_clean>Ottifants, The</title_clean>				<plot>Bruno is a baby Ottifant. It's an ordinary evening, and Bruno's dad is working late at office. Reason enough for Bruno's vivid imagination to run riot, thinking that his dad has been kidnapped by aliens! Jelly babies, that fell from his father's pocket on the way to work, blaze a trail to the office. Now it's up to Bruno to fight his way through hordes of terrorizing toys, Ottifant-eating plants, tear through gloomy caverns of doom and cut across a perilous jungle - workaday objects and boringly normal settings as seen through kids' eyes - and rescue his dad![CR]The Ottifants for the SEGA Game Gear is a 2D side-scrolling platformer where the player controls Bruno through five worlds: starting with the house and the basement, through to the building site, the office and finally the jungle, whereas each world is in turn divided into three stages. Bruno's primary weapon is his trunk, which gives him the ability to blast enemies by firing sweets at them, or suck in objects like out-of-reach platforms or boxes by holding down the Fire-button. Furthermore, yellow, green and red lollies are spread throughout the stages. Gathering three of them activate one of Bruno's special skills and can - depending on the colour combination - transform the baby Ottifant into Superfant with the ability to fly, boost his speed with Speedy Shoes, give an extra Continue and more. [CR]Picking up jelly babies, blasting enemies and collecting papers gives points and raises Bruno's score up to a fixed value of 9,999 pts. There are several entrances to secret rooms hidden in the five worlds. But, unlike the Genesis-version, the rooms are quite small and basic and there is no 1,000 point reward by completing them. On the whole there are two different tunes backing your journey through the game: one for the stages and one for the boss enemies. The varied background music and sound effects of the Genesis-game are completely missing, as is one entire world: The Garden.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter the appropriate password to go to the desired level: [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Pause the game, hold both buttons 1 and 2 down, and unpause the game to skip the current level.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1993</releasedate>				<year>1993</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>4.8</rating>				<videoid>ZaH-bfxhyok</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3067</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570217-the-ottifants</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/ottifants</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/the-ottifants/3030-29290/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3067-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/149160-the-ottifants-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/149161-the-ottifants-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/152911-the-ottifants-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/319715-the-ottifants-sega-master-system-screenshot-copyright-info.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/319716-the-ottifants-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-and-language.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/319717-the-ottifants-sega-master-system-screenshot-first-level-the.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/319718-the-ottifants-sega-master-system-screenshot-starting-location.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/319719-the-ottifants-sega-master-system-screenshot-i-can-get-this.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/319720-the-ottifants-sega-master-system-screenshot-i-grabbed-a-floating.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/319721-the-ottifants-sega-master-system-screenshot-shooting-an-enemy.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/319722-the-ottifants-sega-master-system-screenshot-made-it-to-the.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/319723-the-ottifants-sega-master-system-screenshot-i-need-to-use.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/319724-the-ottifants-sega-master-system-screenshot-wheee.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Out Run (World)">				<description>Out Run (World)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FOut%20Run%20%28World%29.zip" size="142136" />				<title_clean>Out Run</title_clean>				<plot>Race across varied terrain in this conversion of one of the most famous arcade racing games.

It featured a custom bicycle handle controller that the player would use to accelerate, brake, and turn the titular Paperboy's bicycle on screen. A button would cause him to throw his paper to the left, to either deliver the paper perfectly in a mailbox or doorstep, or for more destructive purposes.[CR]There are three different courses on which you can deliver papers: Easy Street, Middle Road, and Hard Way. You score points for each paper successfully delivered to a subscriber, but also for breaking the windows or other household features of non-subscribers. Each run through the course would be a single day, with an entire game consisting of delivering Monday through Sunday. At the end of each day any subscribers that had a paper successfully delivered would give a bonus. Any subscribers missed on that day would unsubscribe for the following day. If you delivered perfectly to each house you would receive double points for each subscriber, and, unless at the max, get a formerly lost subscriber back.[CR]Each day would get progressively harder, with even Easy Street being quite challenging by Thursday or Friday. The difficulty was ramped up by adding more obstacles, making the doorsteps and mailboxes harder to get at, and increasing the speed of cross traffic on the one intersection. Each run through a particular day is the same, however, so eventually the player can memorize the various patterns.[CR]At the end of the street is the "Training Course", which is an obstacle course with targets, jumps, and static obstacles suitable for running up more points.

The player can choose between three main modes, each with their own variants:Billiards[CR]The Billiards mode includes different versions of billiards and pool, all played on a standard pool table. The variants are:Basic: In basic mode, the only goal is to be the first to hit a player-specified score. Each pocketed ball is worth one point - the numbers on them don't matter. Not pocketing a ball (or pocketing the cue ball) passes the turn onto the next player. If all balls are potted without a winner, then a new set of nine are placed on the table. Play resumes until the target score is hit.5-ball: In 5-ball the goal is to sink the numbered balls up to five, and then sink the five ball. Sinking any balls higher than four counted as a foul. Sinking the five ball (legally) wins a set and the player can decide how many sets are required to win the game before playing.9-ball: In 9-ball the players must sink as many balls but can only hit the lowest numbered ball on the table with the cue ball. The number of the ball sunk doesn't matter, as long as the first collision was between the lowest numbered ball and the cue ball. Sinking the nine ball at any time (even with balls left on the table) wins the set. Like with 5-ball, the player can choose how many sets are needed to win.Rotation: The number on the ball denotes how many points the player earns for potting it. The first player to hit a pre-determined point total first is the winner.Darts[CR]All darts variants are played on a standard darts board. This mode requires some finesse, as the player must carefully select their position, the strength of the toss and the point at which the dart leaves the hand. The player can even select the weight of the darts, which effects the throwing mechanic. The variants include:301: A basic scoring mode. Each player switches after throwing three darts. In order to win, a player must score 301 points exactly with the last throw being a double.501: A basic scoring mode. Like 301 but with a higher total of 501, which creates a longer game.Round The Clock: The goal of this mode is to hit 1-10 in order. If a number is missed, the player must try to hit it on their subsequent turn before they can move on. The winner is the first to reach 10.Double Down: The goal is to hit the numbers (or areas) suggested by the scoreboard, starting with 15. There are also rounds where the player must hit a double, a triple or the bullseye. Successfully hitting the right number/bonus increases the score, with additional bonuses for hitting it multiple times. Missing the number with all three darts simply halves the player's current score instead. After nine rounds, the player with the highest score wins.World Bingo[CR]World Bingo only has one mode and it's simply a case of choosing a layout, betting on a particular chain of numbers showing up and then watching a string of randomized numbers appear and then be added to the layout. The player can also change their mind and bet on different chains and lines if they wish.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1987</releasedate>				<year>1987</year>				<genre>Sports</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1-4 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>4.0</rating>				<videoid>AuHvAEQ68Tk</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2958</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588114-parlour-games</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/parlour-games</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/parlour-games/3030-18521/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8294</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2958-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/66747-parlour-games-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164664-parlour-games-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/207120-parlour-games-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/153765-parlour-games-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/153766-parlour-games-sega-master-system-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/153767-parlour-games-sega-master-system-screenshot-playing-billiards.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/153768-parlour-games-sega-master-system-screenshot-playing-darts.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/153769-parlour-games-sega-master-system-screenshot-playing-bingo.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2341173-parlour_games__usa__europe_000.png</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2341172-parlour_games__usa__europe_001.png</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2341171-parlour_games__usa__europe_002.png</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2341170-parlour_games__usa__europe_003.png</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2341169-parlour_games__usa__europe_004.png</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Pat Riley Basketball (USA) (Proto)">				<description>Pat Riley Basketball (USA) (Proto)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FPat%20Riley%20Basketball%20%28USA%29%20%28Proto%29.zip" size="102429" />				<title_clean>Pat Riley Basketball</title_clean>				<plot>Fast break for big-time hoop play with Pat Riley Basketball!

Despite the divergent "space penguin" setting, it appears to be more of a graphically-enhanced port of the original Doki Doki Penguin than an entirely new game, as many stages are identical between the two.[CR]Originally released for the Sega Master System, this game implements an action/puzzle system of sorts. The player is a penguin with an egg and the goal is to get the egg to the bottom of the tunnels and onto the penguin's spaceship where its crew is waiting. Along the way there are polar bears guarding the tunnels that can not only beat the penguin up, but destroy the egg as well. The player also needs to be wary of various traps and letting the egg drop fall too far, as both have the potential to break the egg.[CR]Not only was there a bevvy of developer made puzzle sequences, which all are unlocked from the beginning, but the game also had a fully featured level editor. This editor allowed the user to add any type of blocks to a set level size.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound test menu[CR]To enter the sound test menu, on the title screen press left, left, right, right, up, down, left, right.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1987</releasedate>				<year>1987</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>4.0</rating>				<videoid>7_bz78xpgXA</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2962</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588115-penguin-land</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/penguin-land</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/penguin-land/3030-15446/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8580</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2962-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2962-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/188712-penguin-land-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/301160-penguin-land-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/36742-penguin-land-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/36743-penguin-land-sega-master-system-screenshot-intro-scene.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/36744-penguin-land-sega-master-system-screenshot-in-game.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/484306-penguin-land-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-stomper-has.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/20745/1356325-0606.gif</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/20745/1356323-penguin_land_20080530002625311_640w.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/20745/1356322-penguin_land_sms_screenshot2.gif</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/20745/1356320-penguin_land.gif</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/c/5/gfs_87714_1_1.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/5/8/gfs_87714_2_1.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2962-1.jpg</fanart1>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/hnTDs38.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="PGA Tour Golf (Europe)">				<description>PGA Tour Golf (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FPGA%20Tour%20Golf%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="176857" />				<title_clean>PGA Tour Golf</title_clean>				<plot>PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions commonly seen in the genre since.

It was released in the same general time period as Square's Final Fantasy and Enix's Dragon Warrior, giving birth to the Japanese RPG genre. Phantasy Star featured many of the genre's staples such as a four member party, turn-based combat, and several standard fantasy archetypes such as the warrior and the magic user. Phantasy Star differed from its contemporaries in two distinct ways: dungeons were displayed in a first person perspective and the main character was a female.[CR]Phantasy Star was released in the U.S. as the most expensive home game to date, with a retail price of $80. Although it was technically released in the U.S. prior to Final Fantasy, the latter went on to enjoy much greater success due to the penetration rate of the Nintendo Entertainment System.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Palma[CR]Phantasy Star takes place in the Algol star system, which is composed of three planets, Palma, Motavia and Dezoris. The game starts on Palma, which is a green planet with large oceans, mountain ranges and forests. Motavia and Dezoris, which are traveled to later in the game, are a desert and ice planet respectively. The Algol system is currently ruled by King Lassic, who resides in a floating castle above Palma.Alis Landale[CR]Players are placed in the role of Alis Landale, a teenage girl who watches the murder of her brother Nero by King Lassic's guards. Prior to his death, Nero tells Alis to find Odin, a legendary warrior who can help her in her quest for revenge. From there the player engages in quests that eventually bring Odin, a feline creature named Myau, and the Esper Noah together in an effort to overthrow King Lassic. Later in the game, foreshadowing leads the player to believe there may be even more to the story. Players eventually build a starship, a hovercraft, a land-rover and an ice drill to traverse the different environments.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Alis, Noah, Odin and Myau[CR]The main characters in Phantasy Star are:Alis: Female lead character, sister to the murdered Nero, and party leader. Alis uses a sword as her primary weapon and has access to healing magic.Odin: Warrior archetype, uses a wide range of weapons for combat, and has no magic abilities. Odin's ability to use guns sets him apart from the other characters.Myau: Feline creature that is rescued from a pet store by Alis and Odin. Myau scratches at enemies and has stronger healing magic. Myau also has a history with Odin and a secret ability that is revealed near the end of the game.Noah: An esper (mage) living underground in Motavia. Noah joins the party only after they present him with a letter from the Governor of Motavia. He is a powerful spell caster.King Lassic: The main antagonist for most of the game, King Lassic is responsible for the murder of Alis' brother. He, like the Governor of Motavia, seems to be acting weird...Dark Falz: A mysterious and unexplained evil in the game that serves as the final antagonist. Dark Falz appears early on in a dream sequence, and can eventually be found in a hidden dungeon beneath the Governor's mansion on Motavia. Dark Falz would later become Dark Force in subsequent Phantasy Star games.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Exploring a Planet[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in Phantasy Star contains most of the common staples of the genre. Overworld exploration is done via a top-down viewpoint, and random encounters are engaged while moving across the map. Battles take place in a first person perspective, with only the monster and battle interface visible. Visual cues such as laser beams, magic streaks or weapon slashes indicate the player is attacking, and the player's foe shows a small amount of animation to indicate their actions. Phantasy Star limits the battle to a single monster type, with multiple monsters (of the same type) being represented by a single animated representation. A menu in the upper right corner of the screen shows the player how many foes they are facing as well as their respective hit points.A Dungeon[CR]Dungeons are presented in a first-person perspective in a grid-like fashion. Movement in a dungeon is done one step at a time, with a chance of engaging in battle on each step. Dungeons feature trap doors that can drop the party multiple floors, and no indicators for direction or floor are available, leaving the player to handle mapping dungeons outside of the game itself. Combat within a dungeon is similar to combat on the overworld.[CR][B]Sequels:[/B][CR]Phantasy Star for the Master System was the first in the franchise, and was followed by a direct sequel on the Sega Mega Drive (a.k.a. Genesis). Events in the first game are not a part of the sequel's main story until the end. Events in the first Phantasy Star game are directly mentioned in Phantasy Star IV, where a town has erected a statue to the hero Alis and her cat Myau.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1988</releasedate>				<year>1987</year>				<genre>RPG</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.9</rating>				<ESRB>E10+ - Everyone 10+</ESRB>				<videoid>n3P-3GsiRIw</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2965</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588116-phantasy-star</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/phantasy-star</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/phantasy-star/3030-7400/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8295</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2965-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2965-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://i.imgur.com/8ncTX7c.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/46434-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/52282-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart5>				<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/59222-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart6>				<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/301786-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart7>				<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-1.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-2.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-3.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-4.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-5.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-6.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-7.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/36745-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212135-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-screenshot-korean-title-screen.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/36746-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-screenshot-intro-scene.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2965-1.jpg</fanart1>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/Yy53Vi9.png</banner1>				<banner2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/2965-g2.jpg</banner2>			</game>			<game name="Phantasy Star (Brazil)">				<description>Phantasy Star (Brazil)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FPhantasy%20Star%20%28Brazil%29.zip" size="318963" />				<title_clean>Phantasy Star</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Title Screen[CR]Phantasy Star is an 8-bit console RPG released for the Sega Master System in 1988.

It was released in the same general time period as Square's Final Fantasy and Enix's Dragon Warrior, giving birth to the Japanese RPG genre. Phantasy Star featured many of the genre's staples such as a four member party, turn-based combat, and several standard fantasy archetypes such as the warrior and the magic user. Phantasy Star differed from its contemporaries in two distinct ways: dungeons were displayed in a first person perspective and the main character was a female.[CR]Phantasy Star was released in the U.S. as the most expensive home game to date, with a retail price of $80. Although it was technically released in the U.S. prior to Final Fantasy, the latter went on to enjoy much greater success due to the penetration rate of the Nintendo Entertainment System.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Palma[CR]Phantasy Star takes place in the Algol star system, which is composed of three planets, Palma, Motavia and Dezoris. The game starts on Palma, which is a green planet with large oceans, mountain ranges and forests. Motavia and Dezoris, which are traveled to later in the game, are a desert and ice planet respectively. The Algol system is currently ruled by King Lassic, who resides in a floating castle above Palma.Alis Landale[CR]Players are placed in the role of Alis Landale, a teenage girl who watches the murder of her brother Nero by King Lassic's guards. Prior to his death, Nero tells Alis to find Odin, a legendary warrior who can help her in her quest for revenge. From there the player engages in quests that eventually bring Odin, a feline creature named Myau, and the Esper Noah together in an effort to overthrow King Lassic. Later in the game, foreshadowing leads the player to believe there may be even more to the story. Players eventually build a starship, a hovercraft, a land-rover and an ice drill to traverse the different environments.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Alis, Noah, Odin and Myau[CR]The main characters in Phantasy Star are:Alis: Female lead character, sister to the murdered Nero, and party leader. Alis uses a sword as her primary weapon and has access to healing magic.Odin: Warrior archetype, uses a wide range of weapons for combat, and has no magic abilities. Odin's ability to use guns sets him apart from the other characters.Myau: Feline creature that is rescued from a pet store by Alis and Odin. Myau scratches at enemies and has stronger healing magic. Myau also has a history with Odin and a secret ability that is revealed near the end of the game.Noah: An esper (mage) living underground in Motavia. Noah joins the party only after they present him with a letter from the Governor of Motavia. He is a powerful spell caster.King Lassic: The main antagonist for most of the game, King Lassic is responsible for the murder of Alis' brother. He, like the Governor of Motavia, seems to be acting weird...Dark Falz: A mysterious and unexplained evil in the game that serves as the final antagonist. Dark Falz appears early on in a dream sequence, and can eventually be found in a hidden dungeon beneath the Governor's mansion on Motavia. Dark Falz would later become Dark Force in subsequent Phantasy Star games.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Exploring a Planet[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in Phantasy Star contains most of the common staples of the genre. Overworld exploration is done via a top-down viewpoint, and random encounters are engaged while moving across the map. Battles take place in a first person perspective, with only the monster and battle interface visible. Visual cues such as laser beams, magic streaks or weapon slashes indicate the player is attacking, and the player's foe shows a small amount of animation to indicate their actions. Phantasy Star limits the battle to a single monster type, with multiple monsters (of the same type) being represented by a single animated representation. A menu in the upper right corner of the screen shows the player how many foes they are facing as well as their respective hit points.A Dungeon[CR]Dungeons are presented in a first-person perspective in a grid-like fashion. Movement in a dungeon is done one step at a time, with a chance of engaging in battle on each step. Dungeons feature trap doors that can drop the party multiple floors, and no indicators for direction or floor are available, leaving the player to handle mapping dungeons outside of the game itself. Combat within a dungeon is similar to combat on the overworld.[CR][B]Sequels:[/B][CR]Phantasy Star for the Master System was the first in the franchise, and was followed by a direct sequel on the Sega Mega Drive (a.k.a. Genesis). Events in the first game are not a part of the sequel's main story until the end. Events in the first Phantasy Star game are directly mentioned in Phantasy Star IV, where a town has erected a statue to the hero Alis and her cat Myau.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1988</releasedate>				<year>1987</year>				<genre>RPG</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.9</rating>				<ESRB>E10+ - Everyone 10+</ESRB>				<videoid>n3P-3GsiRIw</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2965</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588116-phantasy-star</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/phantasy-star</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/phantasy-star/3030-7400/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8295</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2362975-sms_phantasystar_br.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://i.imgur.com/5rKzPIT.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://i.imgur.com/8ncTX7c.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/46434-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/52282-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart5>				<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/59222-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart6>				<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/301786-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart7>				<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-1.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-2.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-3.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-4.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-5.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-6.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-7.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/36745-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212135-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-screenshot-korean-title-screen.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/36746-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-screenshot-intro-scene.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2965-1.jpg</fanart1>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/Yy53Vi9.png</banner1>				<banner2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/2965-g2.jpg</banner2>			</game>			<game name="Phantasy Star (USA, Europe) (Rev 2)">				<description>Phantasy Star (USA, Europe) (Rev 2)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FPhantasy%20Star%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29%20%28Rev%202%29.zip" size="319344" />				<title_clean>Phantasy Star</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Title Screen[CR]Phantasy Star is an 8-bit console RPG released for the Sega Master System in 1988.

Events in the first Phantasy Star game are directly mentioned in Phantasy Star IV, where a town has erected a statue to the hero Alis and her cat Myau.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1988</releasedate>				<year>1987</year>				<genre>RPG</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.9</rating>				<ESRB>E10+ - Everyone 10+</ESRB>				<videoid>n3P-3GsiRIw</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2965</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588116-phantasy-star</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/phantasy-star</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/phantasy-star/3030-7400/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8295</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2362975-sms_phantasystar_br.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://i.imgur.com/5rKzPIT.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://i.imgur.com/8ncTX7c.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/46434-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/52282-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart5>				<boxart6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/59222-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart6>				<boxart7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/301786-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart7>				<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-1.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-2.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-3.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-4.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-5.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-6.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2965-7.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/36745-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212135-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-screenshot-korean-title-screen.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/36746-phantasy-star-sega-master-system-screenshot-intro-scene.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2965-1.jpg</fanart1>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/Yy53Vi9.png</banner1>				<banner2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/2965-g2.jpg</banner2>			</game>			<game name="Pit Fighter (Europe)">				<description>Pit Fighter (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FPit%20Fighter%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="216475" />				<title_clean>Pit Fighter</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pit-Fighter is a fighting game released by Atari Games in 1990.

He has great leg reach due to being a kick boxer, and could execute a roundhouse kick, a flying kick and a spin kick.KatoKato is the most agile of the fighters, is the easiest to KO, but uses very formidable Karate skills to make up for this, such as a powerful backhand, a flip kick and a combo punch.[CR]There were also eight unplayable characters who were, nonetheless, given a digitized sprite just like the main characters, and were available as opponents as the game progressed.[CR]These unplayable characters, in order of appearance, include:Executioner - Wears a hood and flexes his muscles. He is the first available boss.Southside Jim - A black, normal dressing street character, who is extremely fast.Angel - A femme fatale, who has fast combo kicks and incredible agility.C.C. Rider - A generic biker, who has extremely powerful punches but slow speed.Mad Miles - A dreadlocks sporting maniac, has some punishing combos.Heavy Metal - Has a very reminiscent 80's rocker look.Chainman Eddie - Has a chain mail chest and a look close to Bennett from the Arnold Schwarzengger film Commando.Masked Warrior - The final boss, has a terrifying mask and is extremely difficult to KO.[CR]Ports[CR]Though the arcade version of Pit-Fighter quickly became irrelevant due to the introduction of Mortal Kombat and other highly successful fighters, it was ported to many home consoles and portable devices, which included the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amistrad, SNES, Genesis, Atari Lynx, Sinclair Spectrum and Game Boy. These ports varied widely in quality, though all retained the basic characters and gameplay style that Pit-Fighter was known for.[CR]The arcade version of Pit-Fighter was also featured in a recent greatest hit compilation known as Midway Arcade Treasures 2, which was available on Playstation 2, Xbox and Gamecube, as well as a PC-only compilation named Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Minigame and Messages[CR]Get a high score and enter one of these as your name:</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1991</releasedate>				<year>1991</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>Domark Software Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>1.5</rating>				<videoid>IwxtuLn2QpE</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2966</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570265-pit-fighter</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/pit-fighter</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/pit-fighter/3030-12530/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2966-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/275739-pit-fighter-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/275740-pit-fighter-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/72346-pit-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/72317-pit-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-options.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/72318-pit-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-pick-your-character.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/72319-pit-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-get-psyched.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/72322-pit-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-they-change-colour.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/72323-pit-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-end-of-match.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/72325-pit-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-southside-jim.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/72326-pit-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-continue.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/72330-pit-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-executioner.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/72331-pit-fighter-sega-master-system-screenshot-hes-hopping-mad.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Pit Fighter (Brazil)">				<description>Pit Fighter (Brazil)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FPit%20Fighter%20%28Brazil%29.zip" size="218379" />				<title_clean>Pit Fighter</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pit-Fighter is a fighting game released by Atari Games in 1990.

Originally developed for the Amiga, Atari ST, and PC platforms, the premise of Populous is simple: the player is a god, and as such, has world-altering powers that can be used for the betterment of one's own devotees or the detriment of all unbelievers. From an isometric perspective, the player uses both direct control of the game world and indirect interaction with followers in order to ensure the prosperity and growth of their people first and foremost. The player's divine powers grow in direct relation to the overall fortunes of their faithful, and the ultimate objective of each scenario is to become powerful enough to challenge and conquer an opposing deity with worshipers and abilities of its own.European Cover Art[CR]Aside from putting Bullfrog Productions and its designer Peter Molyneux on the proverbial map as game developers, Populous was an influential game in its own right recognized by many as the starting point of the god game, a sub-genre of strategy/simulation games in which players are cast as powerful beings whose prime directive is the stewardship of their followers. Many of the mechanics laid down in Populous would be used in future Bullfrog games (Powermonger and Dungeon Keeper, for instance), and Molyneux's first project at Lionhead Studios, 2001's Black &amp; White, is commonly viewed as an attempt to evolve the ideas presented in the Populous games, and as a result is often called the spiritual successor to the series. Furthermore, games made thereafter, such as 2011's From Dust, that feature environmental manipulation for the specific purpose of aiding a group of people outside of the player's direct control are usually said to draw their lineage directly from Populous.[CR]The success of Populous led to two expansions, The Promised Lands and The Final Frontier (both of which were released in 1989), as well as two sequels, Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods in 1992, and Populous: The Beginning in 1998. In 2008, an updated port of Populous dubbed Populous DS was released for the Nintendo DS by Japanese developer Genki. It was created with the ostensible goal of "retaining the feel" of the original Populous while also adding new features such as updated visuals, touch screen support, wireless multiplayer, and five new gods each with distinct gameplay differences.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game interface: mini-map (upper left), Manna Bar and Information Shield (upper right), command icons (lower left), and playing field (center)[CR]The most important imperative in the game is the growth of one's follower population (hence the game's name). The player can facilitate faster growth primarily by ensuring that followers have adequate surfaces upon which to build their settlements. The more uniform the landscape, the larger the settlement that can be built there, and larger settlements reward players with greater defense and better technology. Smaller settlements do have their place, though, as they are quicker to erect and much faster to populate, making for much more rapid expansion. Population size affects what abilities the player has access to, as all physical manifestations of divine power cost manna, and this manna is directly derived from followers, thus more of one means more of the other. Additionally, since the player exerts no direct control over their subjects, having a numerical advantage is the easiest way to ensure victory when encountering rival followers. Many godly powers, such as Earthquake and Volcano, are directly designed to hinder an opponent's ability to effectively settle their land and thus grow stronger.[CR]Once one's follower population has grown to a sufficient size, the player's main goal is to overcome an enemy deity whose presence threatens their own supremacy. Encounters with the enemy will happen as a natural byproduct of expansion on most maps, though when the time comes followers can also be directed specifically to seek out and subdue opposing settlers. In order to be fully victorious and move on to the next map, all enemy followers and domiciles must be killed or destroyed. Opposing forces will automatically fight when they come into contact with one another, and the victor is determined purely on relative strength, which is in turn determined by the number of followers in a stack and the level of technology they possess. Settlement size comes into play here once again, as larger buildings allow for greater technological achievements than smaller ones. The number of citizens within a stack can be increased manually by ordering followers to gather together; any two friendly units which contact one another will combine into a single, stronger unit.ModesA mysterious confidant congratulates the player between missions.[CR]Populous has three main modes of play: Tutorial, Conquest, and Custom. The Tutorial mode consists of a preset map designed more than anything to allow players to familiarize themselves with the game's controls and the various powers at their disposal. Conquest is the main mode of Populous, which allows players to progress through a series of 500 maps, conquering one world at a time before moving on to the next. Player performance is key to progression in this mode, as the player does not simply progress in linear fashion through each map. Rather, the player's score at the end of each mission is taken as an indicator of one's relative skill, and the difficulty of the next mission is chosen as a direct reflection of said score. Mission objective do not change over the course of Conquest mode, though the aptitude of one's opposition (as well as the powers available to them) will increase over time. Several different terrain types come into play as well, though their effects on gameplay is decidedly subtle. Settlers can die more easily on a desert world, for example, and population growth is stunted on an ice planet. Though the player can save their game at any time, the name of each planet also serves as a password of sorts, allowing players to jump to a specific world by simply inputting its name. The final mode of play is Custom, which pulls triple duty of serving as the game's portal for playing scenarios with customized parameters, creating custom maps, and also connecting to a second player (via modem) for multiplayer skirmishes.Inspecting the Game WorldThe Information Shield, complete with Population Bars (sides)[CR]Seeing as the player has no real dominion over the individual activities of worshipers, various tools are provided to allow players to quickly survey their surroundings and also gauge the level of efficacy of followers and buildings. Individual targets can be selected at any time by using the Query button, which causes a shield icon to appear next to the selected object. This indicates that any information appearing in the upper-right status shield pertains specifically to this target (which can in turn be located at any time by using the Zoom to Shield button). The status shield is divided into four quadrants. The quadrant in the upper left simply indicates which side the selected target belongs to, with an ankh signifying good, and a skull signifying evil. The quadrant to its right shows the target's level of sophistication, with more advanced weapon icons indicating a greater level of technology. The lower left quadrant shows a representation of the selected target, while the lower right displays two bars. In the case of a building, these bars show overall defense in yellow on the left, and progress toward production of the next follower in green on the right. In the case of followers, two orange bars showing unit strength fill over time. Once both bars have been filled, the left bar changes to yellow, indicating that it is gauging higher strength values than before. On either side of the Information Shield are two additional bars which show the population size of both the good and evil players on the left and right sides respectively.QueryQueryThe Query button allows the player to quickly ascertain the strength of a given target, whether they be friendly or hostile. Querying a target will persist until another target is queried, so it is possible, for instance, to use it as an easy way to keep track of an opposing leader's activities, or, when used with Zoom to Shield, to be able to quickly shift focus to a location of the player's choosing.Zoom to ShieldZoom to ShieldThe Zoom to Shield command serves to quickly refocus the player's field of view upon the last queried target. Naturally, if the player has yet to use the Query function, the Zoom to Shield icon does nothing. This mainly serves to allow players to quickly see something that might not be covered by other Zoom functions.Zoom to LeaderZoom to LeaderPressing the Zoom to Leader button, unsurprisingly, centers the player's view upon the leader of their followers. If the player's people are currently leaderless, then this function will center the field of view upon the player's Papal Magnet, usually the site of their leader's demise, until such time as a new leader has been chosen.Zoom to KnightZoom to KnightThe function of the Zoom to Knight button changes depending on whether the player left- or right-clicks. Upon left-clicking, it will cycle between all knights that the player currently possesses; when right-clicking, however, it will rotate its focus instead through all of the player's various settlements.Zoom to BattleZoom to BattleA simple click of the Zoom to Battle button will jump the camera instantly to any active hostile engagements, and, if there are more than one, it will cycle between all confrontations upon additional clicks. Like most Zoom functions, if there are no valid targets to jump to, pressing the button has no effect.Divine Mandates[CR]Though no true control is given over one's followers (alternately called walkers) in Populous, as the object of their worship the player is given the prerogative to direct the focus of their attentions. There are four options for influencing the behavior of walkers, and regardless of which is chosen, the player's people will dutifully endeavor to conform to this mandate in order to better satisfy their god. Directives do not require manna in the same way that physical manifestations of power do, though at the same time their effects are not nearly as dramatic nor as immediate.Go to MagnetGo to MagnetThe Go to Magnet command instructs all followers to gather around their leader, who will in turn go toward the Papal Magnet. In situations where the player's leader has died, this instructs followers to head directly toward the Magnet, where the first follower to touch the Magnet will be appointed the new leader.SettleSettleFaithful who have been directed to settle will look around their environment for suitable land upon which to erect new buildings, with preference being given for unexplored areas. Regardless of where they choose to settle, settlers will always construct the largest settlement that their particular plot of land allows.Gather TogetherGather TogetherThe Gather Together function implores a player's followers to search for others of their tribe so that they might commune with them. If successful, the two walkers will band together, forming a single more powerful unit. If unsuccessful in finding others, a follower will simply attempt to construct more settlements.FightFightWalkers that have been instructed to fight will actively search for any non-allied units and attempt to defeat them before repeating the process. Much like the Gather Together mandate, if a follower is unable to find suitable targets in its immediate vicinity, it will choose instead to build new settlements.Divine Intervention[CR]Often it is required that a god take matters into its own hands, and for these situations there are a variety of choices for direct intervention. Just below the player's Information Shield is the Manna Bar, which shows what godly powers are currently available for use. Various icons representing specific powers are arrayed along this bar, and once the Manna Bar's indicator arrow has reached the icon for a specific power, this indicates that it can be used. These range from minor displays like slightly modifying the height of land to more cataclysmic ones like Armageddon. Having a larger number of followers will raise the manna indicator arrow quicker and also allow for more frequent use of powers, as manna can be replenished more quickly with more devotees.Raise/Lower LandRaise/Lower LandThe least expensive and ironically most important of the godly powers is the ability to raise and lower land, which helps primarily to make the environment more habitable for one's followers. Left-clicking while in this mode will raise the plot of land where the player's cursor currently resides, while right-clicking will lower it.Papal MagnetPapal MagnetPlacing a Papal Magnet on any are of the map will designate that point as a beacon to which allied followers are drawn. When a leader dies or is knighted, the Papal Magnate's position is fixed to the last place that the leader occupied, and cannot be repositioned until the player has appointed a new leader through the Go to Magnet command.EarthquakeEarthquakeThe Earthquake ability randomly rearranges all tiles withinin the player's current field of view, disrupting settlements and any other activities within the area. As the cheapest disruption spell available in most scenarios, it is one of the more common ways of hindering the development of rival walkers.SwampSwampUse of the Swamp ability creates a swamp on any flat surface within the field of view. Depending on mission parameters, this will swallow up either a single walker or all walkers who attempt to traverse it. Swamp tiles can only be destroyed by raising or lowering the land tile upon which they are situated.KnightKnightBy invoking the Knight ability, the player's current leader is transformed into a powerful knight that will tirelessly harass the enemy, killing walkers and burning settlements to the ground until it is killed. It is possible for a player to have multiple knights concurrently by selecting and knighting new leaders through the Papal Magnet.VolcanoVolcanoThe area within the field of view is dramatically raised and filled with rocky obstructions when the player summons a volcano. Use of this ability is primarily a disruption tactic much like the use of Earthquake, though the effects are much more time-consuming to reverse than its cheaper cousin.FloodFloodUnlike most land-altering invocations, Flood affects the entire map rather than limiting itself to only the player's field of view, raising the water level of the entire world by one. Special care should be taken before using it to ensure that one's own population won't be more adversely affected by this than the enemy's.ArmageddonArmageddonEssentially a game-ender, Armageddon razes all buildings on the map and calls all followers to the center of the level in order to wage a winner-takes-all showdown in which the player left standing is the ultimate victor. For players who are sure of their own tribe's superiority, this can save a significant amount of hassle.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Press 2 at the 'World To Conquer' Screen.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Input at Password Screen[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]In order this time: [CR]10-Moringhill [CR]16-Badacon [CR]19-Bugqueend [CR]22-Binozond [CR]25-Qazitory [CR]30-Suzalow [CR]33-Hurtloplas [CR]36-Calozboy [CR]41-Burmpal/Bormpal [CR]44-Bilador</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1991</releasedate>				<year>1991</year>				<genre>Strategy</genre>				<studio>Electronic Arts, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>Isometric</perspective>				<rating>3.7</rating>				<videoid>1QitPJWkVG8</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2968</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588117-populous</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/populous</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/populous/3030-6210/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2968-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/22990-populous-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/40189-populous-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50266-populous-sega-master-system-screenshot-stone.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50267-populous-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50268-populous-sega-master-system-screenshot-story.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50269-populous-sega-master-system-screenshot-story-2.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50270-populous-sega-master-system-screenshot-copyrights.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50271-populous-sega-master-system-screenshot-level-beginning.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50272-populous-sega-master-system-screenshot-cross.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50273-populous-sega-master-system-screenshot-hovel.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50274-populous-sega-master-system-screenshot-trees.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2687743-populous001.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Poseidon Wars 3-D (USA, Europe)">				<description>Poseidon Wars 3-D (USA, Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FPoseidon%20Wars%203-D%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" size="130067" />				<title_clean>Poseidon Wars 3-D</title_clean>				<plot>In Poseidon Wars 3-D, you have just entered the navy as a cadet and you must make your way up to Admiral. To do this, you must go out at sea with a submarine and destroy several enemy targets. Once you have defeated each enemy target, the mission is completed, and, upon completing some of them, your rank increases. Before defeating each target, however, you also need to destroy enemy jets, choppers, and submarines who will launch missiles or rockets at you. If you are hit by any of these, damage is inflicted to the submarine, but you can shoot down any of the missiles or rockets. You will need to keep an eye on the built-in radar and sonar to find out where enemies will hit next. Your fuel is limited, and can be increased by destroying certain enemies. The game ends when your submarine is destroyed or you run out of fuel.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Infinite Continues[CR]If you get a Game Over, and want to continue playing, wait until the Game Over screen shows up.

It was later released in the US and Europe as Power Strike, which would then go on to inspire a sequel of its own without Compile's involvement.Power-Ups[CR]Each of Aleste's power-ups are numbered, and can be found throughout the stage. Each needs to be shot to dislodge them and then collected before they can float off screen. There are eight main weapon types and the "P" icons, which increase the current weapon's power. Important to note is that all special weapons (besides "1") are finite in nature, and will vanish after 80 seconds. Collecting another power-up of the same number will add another 80 seconds to the timer.[CR]As well as the special weapons below, there is the default laser. Though relatively weak, the laser can fire in multiple directions like a spread shot gun when powered up.This is a much larger laser shot that carves a path through enemies when fired. The downside is a slight delay between each shot. When fully powered up, it can clear a way through enemies and their fire. It is also infinite, unlike every other secondary weapon.Provides a forward-facing shield which allows the ship to plow through enemies, but leaves their sides and back exposed. Furthermore, there's no way to shoot distant enemies.A long, power laser shot. Cuts a swathe through enemies, but is limited in scope.A barrier, like 2, only it manifests as a group of balls that orbit the ship, protecting it from all directions. The balls grow larger with power-ups, providing better defense.Like 4, this creates several balls, only now they fly away from the ship and home in on enemies. Though good against waves of small darting enemies, it's generally too weak for larger foes.A powerful crescent wave beam that emanates from the ship. Though limited in scope, it can be swayed slightly with horizontal weapon, making it a powerful weapon for experts.Creates a larger barrier than 2. Still limited by its inability to affect distant enemies.Creates a long laser shot that oscillates across the screen in a wave formation, making it very effective for large numbers of enemies.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]At the title screen, press Up, Down, Up, Left, Left, Down, Right, Up and button 1.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Sound Test[CR]At the title screen, press Down, Right, Down, Down, Left, Right, Up, Right and Button 1.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Bonus level[CR]Successfully complete the game.

In this alternate 1930 universe, you are given a bounty for a dangerous pirate and you must shoot down enemies, avoid being shot down yourself and take down your target. Below is a quote of what the back of the box said to introduce the game:[CR]A lone pilot puts on his flight gear and gets ready. His life has been leading up to this moment &#8212; he knows that the time has come to take on the air pirates' sky forces! The battle has begun. Are you ready to help in the fight to free the skies from the clutches of the air pirates?[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game starts off by asking you to pick a weapon for your ship which includes:Type 0 = Shell Up - A rapid fire of bullets go up in an upward path onlyType 1 = Shotgun - One set of bullets shoot forward but four other bigger bullets spread upward hitting a larger amount of enemiesType 2 = Missile - One set of bullets shoot forward while four missiles (total) from either side of you shoot out and seek out targetsType 3 = Burner - One set of bullets  shoot forward, two sticks of fire are being shot from on either side of you while a third one is shot from the nose of your ship (probably the best gun)Type 4 = Absorption - One set of bullets shoot forward while four glowing balls are shot from your ship seeking out enemies to kill (four at a time are shot)Type 5 = Destroyer - One set of bullets shoot forward while 6 missiles (2 from the left and right and 2 from the center) are shot straight out (not seeking)Type 6 = Napalm -  One set of bullets shoot forward and two grenade like shells explode spinning two glowing balls around growing in the processAfter you select your weapon of choice, you go through stages to take on sky pirates and the bounties on their heads. Your main objective is to survive so you can take on the boss of that stage while you shoot down enemies. You can fly around the map if you wish using the D-pad. The only other button you will be pushing down is the fire button (B) while moving around to shoot down your enemies. While shooting them down, you gain points, ship power-ups or weapon power-ups  (coin like items drop from the sky with a P on them) to help you get the high score and advance your ship. Numbers can be floating down during the game which will help you change your weapon during the game. If you pick a weapon type you don't like, you can press the (A) button to switch to a weapon type you like. Collect the coins with the 'P' on them to help power-up your weapon. If you power-up your weapon enough, you will be able to cover more ground or just have a better chance in winning the stage. If you die, you will start off with a new ship and the weapon selected from the beginning of the game. You will have to start over on powering-up your weapon to take advantage of its full potential. There are different types of enemies that you will need to destroy from fliers, ground cannons and floating balloon like ships. Each enemy killed increases your score but they might also drop power-ups (ship or weapon types) for you to use while in battle.There are 8 stages to complete  to beat the game.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]To unlock the Cheat Menu, hold on the Reset button and press Pause 10 times.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Cheat Menu[CR]To get an even easier mode, go to the options screen, and set the difficult to RANK1 CRUSH.

Mechner used film of his younger brother David running, jumping, and performing many of the Prince's actions. Mechner then  rotoscoped the film to create the animations that give the  Prince his fluid movement.[CR]Part of the game's appeal was its then unique focus on  environmental puzzle-solving, as well as its one-on-one  sword duels. Mechner has stated that the game was inspired by the first ten minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark, for the character's  acrobatics in a  dangerous environment.[CR]Prince of Persia has since been ported to a number of different platforms, including the  Amiga,  Apple Macintosh, DOS,  NES,  Game Boy,  Sega Genesis,  Game Gear,  SNES,  Sharp X68000,  Atari ST, and SAM Coup&#233;.[CR]The music was written by Jordan Mechner's father,  Francis Mechner.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Prince of Persia is a platformer with heavy emphasis on careful jumping and environmental puzzle solving. The player controls the Prince as he attempts to  rescue his princess before she  weds  Jaffar, the evil Grand Vizier. Jaffar has trapped the  Princess, and given her an hour to decide whether she wishes to marry him or die. This hour unfolds in  real time, and the only way to lose the game is to fail to reach the Princess within sixty minutes.[CR]The player is given only an hour to navigate the game's thirteen levels and rescue her. Scattered throughout each level are hidden  switches, secret  pitfalls and a variety of other hazards standing in the Prince's way of rescuing his beloved. There are also hidden  potions that have a variety of effects on the Prince.[CR]The player will have to explore and pay attention to their environment in order to solve the puzzles and make it to the end. The Prince will also have to fight his way past  guards to reach the Princess. Combat exists as a series of sword fights, which were unusual for its time when  projectile weapons were the norm.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The Sultan of Persia, one day, leaves to wage war in a foreign land. His Grand Vizier, Jaffar, steps in to take his  throne while he is away. Shortly thereafter, a street urchin decides to climb the Royal Tower to see the Princess, whom people have claimed to be as beautiful as a new moon. When the young  orphan finally sees the Princess,  they fall in love. The couple intend to marry.[CR]The Vizier discovers this and decides that he wants to marry the Princess. He throws the street urchin into the lowest  dungeon and locks the Princess in the highest tower. He then gives the Princess one hour, counted on a magical  hourglass, in which she has to decide to marry the Vizier or die.[CR]The street urchin's main goal is to defeat Jaffar and reach the Princess.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The SNES version[CR]Aside from being ported to several different platforms, Prince of Persia has received  two  proper  sequels and a  3D remake.  Ubisoft re-imagined the series with its  Sands of Time  trilogy, and the French publisher again rebooted the series with a new game, titled simply  Prince of Persia. A motion picture based on  Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is also being developed, Mike Newell directing, and is being produced by  Jerry Bruckheimer. The movie was released in 2010 starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Gemma Arterton, and  Ben Kingsley and was received with average reviews.[CR]The game was  ported many times, and version such as the  SNES one which improved on the original. In the SNES game, the graphics were updated, and the game was given 20 levels, and an extra hour to complete the game.[CR]The original Prince of Persia has sold over 2 million copies.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Gear version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 8,8,7,5 adding, "...very impressed with this version of the game. Not only were all the characters and pitfalls very easy to see on the small screen, but even the very fluid animation found on the other versions of the game was duplicated almost perfectly".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter the appropriate password to go to the desired level:</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1992</releasedate>				<year>1992</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>Domark Software, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.9</rating>				<videoid>u892pDlPHnI</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2977</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588121-prince-of-persia</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/prince-of-persia</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/prince-of-persia/3030-2561/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8297</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2977-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/46440-prince-of-persia-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/46441-prince-of-persia-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/147116-prince-of-persia-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/147117-prince-of-persia-sega-master-system-screenshot-options-screen.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/147118-prince-of-persia-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-intro.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/147120-prince-of-persia-sega-master-system-screenshot-starting-out.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/147122-prince-of-persia-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-great-fall.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/147119-prince-of-persia-sega-master-system-screenshot-fencing-with.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/147121-prince-of-persia-sega-master-system-screenshot-impaled-on.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2728993-4270057297-vrIIz.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2728992-1430439025-PKrFS.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2728991-3386996545-wpqXtxMT.png++</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2977-1.jpg</fanart1>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/voNFpYw.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Pro Wrestling (USA, Europe)">				<description>Pro Wrestling (USA, Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FPro%20Wrestling%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" size="59995" />				<title_clean>Pro Wrestling</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dump Matsumoto is a tag-team wrestling game developed and released by Sega, for the Sega System 16 Arcade system and the Sega Master System (SMS) console, both versions of which are known outside Japan as Body Slam and Pro Wrestling, respectively. While the latter shares a name with the Nintendo-developed release Pro Wrestling for the NES, the games are entirely unrelated.[CR]Players choose from one of four tag-teams and face the other three teams repeatedly, ten falls at a time. After winning ten matches against a team, the game advances to the next team. In the Japanese version the wrestlers were all women (the game's namesake, Dump Matsumoto, was one of these female wrestlers). In the US, they were all changed to male wrestlers that superficially resembled those working in the WWE (then WWF) circuit at the time.[CR]The original Arcade version allowed players to form custom duos composed of two members from each faction. Both the Arcade and SMS versions were originally released in Japan as a celebrity tie-in for the Japanese female wrestler Dump Matsumoto.Tag TeamsMad SoldiersOrient ExpressGreat MaskmenCrush Brothers[CR] [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Challenge the alien champions[CR]To challenge the alien champions, press any direction, 25 times at the game over screen.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1986</releasedate>				<year>1986</year>				<genre>Action, Sports</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.1</rating>				<videoid>Pm3e51r1K1w</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2978</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588122-pro-wrestling</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/pro-wrestling_</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/pro-wrestling/3030-4962/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2978-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2978-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/134374-pro-wrestling-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164032-pro-wrestling-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412568-pro-wrestling-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-rage-fueled.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412569-pro-wrestling-sega-master-system-screenshot-team-select.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412570-pro-wrestling-sega-master-system-screenshot-10-falls.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412571-pro-wrestling-sega-master-system-screenshot-mad-soldiers-entrance.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412572-pro-wrestling-sega-master-system-screenshot-orient-express.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412573-pro-wrestling-sega-master-system-screenshot-kick.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/412574-pro-wrestling-sega-master-system-screenshot-down.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2728611-7020032255-3WKYJ.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2728610-3089176978-utNqx.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2728609-6882669504-h1CVFJc2.png+</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Pro Yakyuu Pennant Race, The (Japan)">				<description>Pro Yakyuu Pennant Race, The (Japan)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FPro%20Yakyuu%20Pennant%20Race%2C%20The%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="74326" />				<title_clean>Pro Yakyuu Pennant Race, The</title_clean>				<plot>You're the manager.

At the end of each world, there are one of seven bosses waiting to destroy you, but some of the later bosses are exactly the same as the earlier ones. The title is a bit misleading because you can also play as three other characters including Hippo, Leopard, and Monkey Boy. Each character has their own disadvantages. For example, Hippo is much slower than the other three. However, all the characters share one thing in common: they can use their fists and punch enemies as they approach them. They can also jump on them and keep knocking them in the ground until they disappear off the face of the earth. If they don't make them disappear, they will pop back out again and set out for revenge. Obstacles are scattered through each area, including spikes, cannonballs, esculators, fireballs, and steam.[CR]You start the game with three lives. Once you touch an enemy, you lose a life. Lose any of your lives, and the game is over. If the game is over, you can continue where you left off. There are several items to find, and these can help you on your quest, and one of these items are eggs. If you break any of these eggs, either the "switch" item or the invincibility item is revealed. If you're lucky enough, a white bag is also revealed, but more often than not, one of your enemies can pop out from inside the egg. One egg will reveal a bird which you can carry for the rest of the game. This bird may be nothing but a pest, as it hinders your progress, but you can throw it at enemies to knock them out. It can also be used as a backup, meaning that you can have enemies touching you, but it is the bird that is killed, not you.[CR]There is little chance that you'll find a white bag inside an egg, unless you go up into a secret area, which can often be found if you jump on springs that are scattered throughout the level. These white bags are useless, until you get to the bonus areas, which are at the end of each area. In these bonus stages, you can place a number of foxes on a path depending on how much white bags you've collected throughout each area.[CR]When you complete Psycho Fox, you are treated to a funny ending.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Skip a level[CR]On world 1-3 where there are a few springs going up to the top of the screen.

If your ball goes into the water, you lose a shot.Bound: Hitting one of these bumper-like objects sends your ball way off course. Try to avoid them if possible. Hit the same bound three times, though, and it disappears!Stationary Bar: This doesn't give your ball any extra momentum, and can be used to make bank shots.Control Bar: This is a springy bar which you can move. Use it to propel your ball up steep, long inclines.Treadmill: On some holes, you'll find treadmills that move continously. Many of the treadmills can be turned on and off by using the appropriate switch.

The game was first released to Japanese arcades in July 1987. The player controls a spacecraft and is tasked with defending humanity against the alien life forms known as Bydo. R-Type is infamously known for its extreme difficulty.[CR]R-Type was originally released in the Arcades and became a major early hit for Irem. It was eventually ported to many home computers and consoles of the era, with the unusual exception of the NES (a bootleg Chinese cart exists, however). The PC Engine of R-Type was split across two releases, but the US TG-16 version manages to fit the whole game onto one HuCard. This TG16 version is also the one that was added to the Wii's Virtual Console in 2006.[CR]R-Type also saw multiple sequels and spin-offs, as well as inspiring many future horizontal-scrolling shoot 'em ups.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Set in the 22nd century, the game takes place in the Bydo Empire. The player must make their way through the 8 merciless levels and defend mankind from the evil attackers. Bydo Dobkeratops - Boss of the first level[CR]The Bydo are biologically engineered weapons created by mankind to be used against their enemies in their quest for universal domination. This plan backfired however and the Bydo began to attack their creators. [CR] The Ship [CR]The player pilots a ship called the R-9a "Arrowhead". The ship is named for its distinctive shape and is the 9th model of the R series of star fighter. The Force[CR]The R-9a "Arrowhead" can be equipped with an indestructible living weapon called "The Force". The force, a spherical pod that can be attached to the ship, is made of Bydo flesh and can absorb energy in order to increase in power. To obtain the force, the player must obtain a weapon power up.

The forces visual appearance changes as it increases in power.Red - A powerful counter-air laser beam that fires horizontally.Blue - Three thin laser beams. One forward firing and two that fire at a 45 degree angle from the front of the ship These beams rebound off walls.Yellow - Two flame beams that fire above and below the ship.

The game was first released to Japanese arcades in July 1987. The player controls a spacecraft and is tasked with defending humanity against the alien life forms known as Bydo. R-Type is infamously known for its extreme difficulty.[CR]R-Type was originally released in the Arcades and became a major early hit for Irem. It was eventually ported to many home computers and consoles of the era, with the unusual exception of the NES (a bootleg Chinese cart exists, however). The PC Engine of R-Type was split across two releases, but the US TG-16 version manages to fit the whole game onto one HuCard. This TG16 version is also the one that was added to the Wii's Virtual Console in 2006.[CR]R-Type also saw multiple sequels and spin-offs, as well as inspiring many future horizontal-scrolling shoot 'em ups.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Set in the 22nd century, the game takes place in the Bydo Empire. The player must make their way through the 8 merciless levels and defend mankind from the evil attackers. Bydo Dobkeratops - Boss of the first level[CR]The Bydo are biologically engineered weapons created by mankind to be used against their enemies in their quest for universal domination. This plan backfired however and the Bydo began to attack their creators. [CR] The Ship [CR]The player pilots a ship called the R-9a "Arrowhead". The ship is named for its distinctive shape and is the 9th model of the R series of star fighter.

The changes are relatively minor, as the original game was inspired in part by Rambo itself and its video-game imitators, namely Ikari Warriors, and to a lesser extent, Commando. The latter two were inspiration for the gameplay itself.[CR]Players can play co-operatively or alone, fighting against soldiers who attack in certain patterns. Players have an upgradable semi-automatic weapon with unlimited ammunition, and explosive arrows which act similarly to grenades, with a definite arc and an area-effect explosion. The player character can't be hit or he immediately dies, and he cannot fire backward, just diagonally forward, to either side, and straight ahead.[CR]Using the explosive arrows, you can free hostages which are held captive in huts. These captives then throw the player a power up, like extra explosive arrows, an extra life, or a zap-effect which kills all enemies on the screen.[CR]At the end of each level, there is an obstacle that must be destroyed through use of explosive arrows, while an endless steam of minions pop up from either side to try to kill you. A certain amount of enemies must be killed before the barrier becomes vulnerable, however.[CR]The fifth level is not like the first four (which take place in what is probably South East Asia and another nondescript, undeveloped area, alternating between the two), but is actually in an urban environment. It may be that the designers intended this to be a reference to First Blood, where Rambo's fight actually takes place in the United States against law enforcement officers. (Incidentally, there are no hostages to free, but when you blow up police cars, you are thrown power-ups from the building the ruined cop car was parked in front of!) The final level has no real analog to the movie series; the enemies all have gas-masks and the end-barrier is a huge, glowing face that actually fires back.[CR]The end boss has quite a few hitpoints, and is rather difficult in comparison to the other end-level obstacles. Surviving that is no small feat, and the player is rewarded with a strangely emphatic, shirtless scene of POW liberation and a ride off into the sunset (aboard a helicopter).[CR]Releases under different names[CR]A separate version of the game was released in Europe and Australia called Secret Commando. The box features the title Secret Command, but the correct title of Secret Commando is present on the carrtridge and on the game's title screen. The game is mostly identical save for the lack of the Rambo license and cover art. Some small differences are linked to the game's other release (Ashura in Japan, see below), such as the names of the heroes (Ashura and Bishamon), althought they did keep their Rambo appearance in game. The title music in the game is the music from Ashura, not the Rambo music.[CR]Similarly, the game was released in Japan with the name Ashura (&#38463;&#20462;&#32645;). Again, without the Rambo license. Ashura was the first release of the title; the game was later released in the US with Rambo artwork added in, under the name Rambo: First Blood Part II. Rather than featuring Rambo (or, indeed, a Secret Commando), the Japanese version had players control a pair of armed Buddhist monks named Ashura and Bishamon. The monks are on a mission to rescue their kidnapped friends from the enemy. The game has some other minor differences, namely the difficulty. The difficult was toned down for the American release. For example, some enemies (the flamethrower soldiers being one) that were only vulnerable to arrows in Ashura, were altered so that the player could kill them with bullets too.[CR]Virtual Console releases[CR]All three versions of Rambo: First Blood Part II (Rambo, Secret Commando and Ashura) were released on the Wii's Virtual Console between 2008 and 2009. They were released in their respective regions; Rambo in North America, Secret Commando in Europe &amp; Australia and Ashura in Japan. Secret Commando was also released on the North American Virtual Console as an "import title".[CR] [CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Continue[CR]To continue, have both players must hold down 1 + 2 and rapidly press Left and Right.

Played from a top-down perspective in-level, with over-the-shoulder perspective boss fights between levels, Rambo uses his AK-47, blocks of C-4, explosive tipped arrows and, of course, his enormous K-BAR knife to fight his way in and out of the 6 levels in the game.[CR]The game also had Rambo accomplishing a variety of mission objectives, including rescuing prisoners, taking out Soviet supplies, and shooting down HIND helicopters with explosive arrows. Some game mechanics included item refills though the use of the combat knife - enemies dispatched with the knife usually leave behind items. This exposed Rambo to additional danger however, since the game employed a one-hit-wonder health system, forcing the player to weigh the risks and rewards of going after those items.[CR]SMS Version[CR]The Sega Master System version of Rambo III is a light-gun game, rather than the top-down shooter found on other systems. Though more similar mechanically to the "behind-the-shoulder" TPS Arcade version, very little of the game appears to have anything to do with the plot of Rambo III, as the generic enemies look nothing like Soviet soldiers. It's possible the game was at one point a generic light gun game and had the Rambo III license bolted onto it late during its development.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1988</releasedate>				<year>1988</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.5</rating>				<videoid>vof5cjlwT4Y</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2987</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588126-rambo-iii</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/rambo-iii__</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/rambo-iii/3030-1172/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8902</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2987-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2987-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/92862-rambo-iii-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/154302-rambo-iii-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/246815-rambo-iii-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart5>				<snapshot1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/screenshots/2987-1.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213353-rambo-iii-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213354-rambo-iii-sega-master-system-screenshot-go-shoot-them.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/538109-rambo-iii-sega-master-system-screenshot-level-completed.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/538110-rambo-iii-sega-master-system-screenshot-level-2.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/538119-rambo-iii-sega-master-system-screenshot-now-there-are-also.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/538120-rambo-iii-sega-master-system-screenshot-each-level-has-a-different.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/538121-rambo-iii-sega-master-system-screenshot-level-3.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/538123-rambo-iii-sega-master-system-screenshot-level-4.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/538124-rambo-iii-sega-master-system-screenshot-level-5.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2987-1.jpg</fanart1>				<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2987-3.jpg</fanart2>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/7JHOYhC.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Rampage (USA, Europe)">				<description>Rampage (USA, Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FRampage%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" size="118643" />				<title_clean>Rampage</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]City being destroyed by a monster![CR]Rampage was first released in arcades in 1986 by Bally Midway. Taking inspiration from giant-monster movies like Godzilla and King Kong, Rampage puts players in the role of one of three oversized monsters-- George the ape, Lizzie the lizard, and Ralph the wolf.[CR]The players start wreaking havoc in Peoria, Illinois, then cut a path of destruction through the United States. In the arcade version, the monsters' attacks take place over 128 days. After those days end, the cities start to repeat, and after five cycles you get to day 768 and the days reset to 1. The console iterations had an actual ending added. The goal in each stage is to knock down every building in the city. The monsters can climb up the sides of buildings and punch out sections of their walls, occasionally eating the hapless humans that they find inside. Take out enough pieces of a building and it will come crashing down. Watch out, though--the National Guard is out in force and will harass the monsters with tanks and jets. If enough damage is taken, the monster will revert to its original human form, sans clothes. In a multiplayer situation, any remaining monsters can grab and eat the ex-monster.[CR]Rampage has seen a number of remakes and sequels over the years with varying degrees of success. Follow-ups include Rampage World Tour, Rampage 2: Universal Tour, Rampage Through Time, and Rampage Puzzle Attack, though none of them have garnered the same positive response as the original.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Continue Game[CR]When you loose all health on your last life, keep pressing Button 2 until you leave the screen as a Human.

After which, the player then has to rebuild their damaged walls and add even more defensive means for the stronger enemy rounds to come. Created by Atari for the Arcades, the game would later see many home releases on a plethora of platforms.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls a handful of castles which must be defended and repaired all within a brisk time-limit. Ships will attack the fortress typically with cannon-fire, and the player must retaliate with their own arsenal, doing their best to protect the castle. They can build walls around their castles to absorb damage, but the player will ultimately need to get a bit creative to survive the increasingly tougher sieges.[CR]The player can place additional cannons within walls if they have been placed correctly. Ideally, the player is able to construct as many cannon enclosures as possible to maximize their offensive output and repel the enemy forces without incurring too much damage.[CR]In single-player, the player starts out by choosing where their fortress will be placed. They're then surrounded by a wall, and can then place their cannons. Following this are a set of rounds; the first being attack, the second repair. After surviving this barrage, the player is given additional time to place more cannons in their fort. The game ends when the player fails to successfully repair their castle, or when enough of the enemy fleet has been sunk.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/9/1993</releasedate>				<year>1993</year>				<genre>Action, Strategy</genre>				<studio>Tengen Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>				<videoid>UnY9YGxyu6A</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>11522</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570271-rampart</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/rampart</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/rampart/3030-19146/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/11522-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/11522-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/91057-rampart-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144038-rampart-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144039-rampart-sega-master-system-screenshot-options-screen.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144040-rampart-sega-master-system-screenshot-waiting-for-player-two.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144041-rampart-sega-master-system-screenshot-level-selection.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144042-rampart-sega-master-system-screenshot-select-your-home-castle.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144044-rampart-sega-master-system-screenshot-prepare-for-battle.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144053-rampart-sega-master-system-screenshot-your-castle-is-under.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144048-rampart-sega-master-system-screenshot-rebuilding-your-walls.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144049-rampart-sega-master-system-screenshot-raking-in-the-bonus.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144050-rampart-sega-master-system-screenshot-place-your-cannons.jpg</snapshot10>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/11522.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Rastan (USA, Europe)">				<description>Rastan (USA, Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FRastan%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" size="130313" />				<title_clean>Rastan</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rastan is a side scrolling platform game that was developed by Taito Corporation in 1987 as a coin-op arcade game.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story is based around the barbarian Rastan.

/>				<title_clean>Renegade</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Renegade is a beat 'em up game using 2D sprites that can move in three dimensions. It uses a system of a fixed location where the player has to fend off waves of opponents until their numbers dwindle, and the stage boss appears to intervene. Two sequels to Renegade were made: Target: Renegade and Renegade 3: The Final Chapter. Neither of the sequels were developed by Technos.Renegade (as an arcade game) is notable for being a western localization of Nekketsu K&#333;ha Kunio-kun. The notability is that the sprite and stage changes are heavily influenced by the 1979 film 'The Warriors'. No lawsuit was ever made against the game for such similarities.Renegade uses various combat techniques that were progressive for beat-em ups of its era. These included reverse attacks (attacking an opponent behind the player), grab attacks and the ability to 'mount' and attack downed enemies. It could be argued that even much later games in the style, such as Final Fight, were influenced by Renegade.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1993</releasedate>				<year>1993</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>2.7</rating>				<videoid>vZZbbKnbT-w</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2990</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/575713-renegade</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/renegade</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/renegade/3030-18293/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2990-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2990-1.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98218-renegade-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98219-renegade-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-get-ready-screen.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98220-renegade-sega-master-system-screenshot-mission-1.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98221-renegade-sega-master-system-screenshot-you-are-thrown-in-the.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98222-renegade-sega-master-system-screenshot-he-s-got-me.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98223-renegade-sega-master-system-screenshot-knocked-out.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98224-renegade-sega-master-system-screenshot-carried-by-two-thugs.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98225-renegade-sega-master-system-screenshot-boss.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98226-renegade-sega-master-system-screenshot-oh-yeah.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/98227-renegade-sega-master-system-screenshot-mission-2.jpg</snapshot10>				<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/2990-g.jpg</banner1>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2990.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Rescue Mission (USA, Europe)">				<description>Rescue Mission (USA, Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FRescue%20Mission%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" size="76718" />				<title_clean>Rescue Mission</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The goal of Rescue Mission is to provide covering fire as a medic uses a hand-cart to reach different wounded soldiers and stitch up their injuries.

Starting at the back of the pack the objective is always to finish first on a linear course, overtaking the other bikers. This is achieved by driving very well or by playing it dirty, knocking opponents of their bikes using clubs, crowbars or your bare hands. The other racers fight back in a similar fashion and there are also hazards. All the races take place on the regular road with normal traffic (in both directions) and the cops, as well as occasional oil slicks and stray cows.[CR]By winning races you can get promoted to a stronger division and earn cash with which you can buy a better bike. Whenever you're knocked off your bike or hit something you will have to run back to your bike and lose valuable time, plus your bike will suffer some damage. When the player crashes with cops nearby, it is possible to get busted and then you have to forfeit the race.[CR]Like the whole Road Rash lineage, the game has arcade-like gameplay with no intention to be a motorcycle simulation. While the game has a two-player mode, this is not simultaneous.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Start on Level 4 with 10,000 Dollars[CR]Type As a Password [CR]00001 [CR]01R60 [CR]10839 [CR]4Q2LN[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Start on Level 4 with 10,000 Dollars[CR]Enter the following at the password screen:</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1994</releasedate>				<year>1994</year>				<genre>Action, Driving, Racing</genre>				<studio>U.S. Gold Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Alt</nplayers>				<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.4</rating>				<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>				<videoid>8QDVV-75C10</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2557</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570267-road-rash</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/road-rash</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/road-rash/3030-8251/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8298</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2557-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2557-1.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142273-road-rash-sega-master-system-screenshot-u-s-gold-logo.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142274-road-rash-sega-master-system-screenshot-probe-logo.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142275-road-rash-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142276-road-rash-sega-master-system-screenshot-course-selection.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142277-road-rash-sega-master-system-screenshot-biff-gives-advice.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142280-road-rash-sega-master-system-screenshot-sierra-nevada.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142283-road-rash-sega-master-system-screenshot-natasha-gives-advice.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142289-road-rash-sega-master-system-screenshot-sledge-gives-advice.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142291-road-rash-sega-master-system-screenshot-redwood-forest.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/142290-road-rash-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-nice-little-jump.jpg</snapshot10>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/EaGzOPW.png</banner1>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/2557.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="RoboCop 3 (Europe)">				<description>RoboCop 3 (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FRoboCop%203%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="129444" />				<title_clean>RoboCop 3</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]RoboCop 3 is an action/shooter game based on the third RoboCop movie. Flying Edge, Acclaim and Ocean were responsible for its development, and the game was published on every console of the period. The console version of RoboCop 3 largely followed the blueprint of the first RoboCop game with its side-scrolling run and gun action. The NES version had a unique feature of its own, with RoboCop incurring damage in his individual body parts that could be repaired between levels.[CR]RoboCop 3D, which was made at the same time and loosely based on the same movie, was also published by Ocean for home computers such as the Amiga, Atari ST and PC but was developed by Digital Image Design instead. It has considerably different gameplay, focusing on first-person shooter gameplay with an engine that uses early examples of polygonal graphics.[CR]The OCP Rehab officers have rolled into Old Detroit, demolishing the homes of hapless families to make way for the construction of OCP's Delta City. Armed with a jetpack and arm attachment with large-bore cannons RoboCop attempts to ward off the corporate overlords and defend the rights of citizens.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the NES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 6,6,5,6 adding, "...Ocean has taken the extra time and effort to make this sequel a much better playing game. Enemies comes (sic) from everywhere, but you have a very limited shooting range".[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1993</releasedate>				<year>1993</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>Acclaim Entertainment, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>2.8</rating>				<videoid>5pOtfmPA_SA</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2993</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570254-robocop-3</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/robocop-3</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/robocop-3/3030-3173/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8299</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2993-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/9/6/5/30965_back.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64376-robocop-3-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64377-robocop-3-sega-master-system-screenshot-options.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64378-robocop-3-sega-master-system-screenshot-level-1.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64379-robocop-3-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-gunman-in-the-window.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64380-robocop-3-sega-master-system-screenshot-two-gunmen-pointing.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64381-robocop-3-sega-master-system-screenshot-robocop-will-get-squashed.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64382-robocop-3-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-motorcycle-going.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64383-robocop-3-sega-master-system-screenshot-cyborg.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64384-robocop-3-sega-master-system-screenshot-boss.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/64385-robocop-3-sega-master-system-screenshot-statistics.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2993-1.jpg</fanart1>				<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/2993-g.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="RoboCop versus The Terminator (Europe)">				<description>RoboCop versus The Terminator (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FRoboCop%20versus%20The%20Terminator%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="278657" />				<title_clean>RoboCop versus The Terminator</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]RoboCop Versus the Terminator is a licensed action game that hypothetically pits the two eponymous cyborg movie characters against each other, placing RoboCop in the role of the savior of humanity from Skynet and its legion of T-800s and other robots. It is based on a comic book series with the same premise.[CR]In the near future, the worlds of RoboCop and The Terminator merge into a single reality. RoboCop is placed in charge with saving mankind by destroying the Skynet super computer and preventing a possible future where machines reign supreme. The player, as RoboCop, must traverse 10 levels of action, fighting against thugs and machines alike, all while utilizing a combination of pistols, laser guns, bazookas and even the deadly ED-209 Gatling gun.

This game reflects the Rocky series quite well. Only in this game you go one guy to the next. From Apollo the remaining champion, to Lang an aggressive contender, to Drago the Soviet boxer who trains constantly. Before you have a fight just like in the "Rocky" movies you have to train. Practice your timing and punching strength with some sandbag punching before fighting Apollo.  Warm up punching a punching ball to become more faster and smarter to get ready for Lang. Then you will do some punching mitts training before fighting Drago where you watch the mitts and punch at the as they move. All of these trainings have qualifications such as punches per second, qualify and your combinations get better for the following fight. [CR]During a fight you only have one meter under your name, that is the power meter. Your opponent has one likewise. Watching your power bar can tell you a lot about which way the fight is headed, either it's full and you can take more punches and punch more powerfully or it's low and you're in  trouble. Watching the opponents power bar will tell you when to take him down or when to block.[CR]Between rounds you get a chance to freshen up and get some last minute coaching. During the one minute interval, your power will go up only half of what has been drained. [CR]If you do happen to take a fall the controls are similar to Nintendos "Punch out", basically you just press the 1 and 2 buttons as fast as possible. Hopefully Rocky stands up and is ready for more.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1987</releasedate>				<year>1987</year>				<genre>Sports</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>2.1</rating>				<videoid>HYHxY18qay8</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>2995</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588133-rocky</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/rocky_</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/rocky/3030-26048/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/9408</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/2995-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/2995-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/119340-rocky-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/301148-rocky-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/207103-rocky-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/207104-rocky-sega-master-system-screenshot-training-1-where-did-he.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/207105-rocky-sega-master-system-screenshot-1st-fight-apollo-vs-rocky.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/207106-rocky-sega-master-system-screenshot-apollo-being-hit-rocky.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/207107-rocky-sega-master-system-screenshot-knockdown.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/207108-rocky-sega-master-system-screenshot-apollo-kissing-the-floor.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/207109-rocky-sega-master-system-screenshot-rocky-wins-but-where-s.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/207110-rocky-sega-master-system-screenshot-training-2-now-wearing.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/207111-rocky-sega-master-system-screenshot-clubber-vs-rocky-dead.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/207123-rocky-sega-master-system-screenshot-come-on-balboa-come-on.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2995-1.jpg</fanart1>				<fanart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2995-2.jpg</fanart2>				<fanart3>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/2995-3.jpg</fanart3>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/eRbosH0.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Running Battle (Europe)">				<description>Running Battle (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FRunning%20Battle%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="115471" />				<title_clean>Running Battle</title_clean>				<plot>[CR]A side scrolling action game which gives you the ability to punch, kick and blast your enemies.

There are actually two versions of this game: The Arcade game and its home conversions, for computers like the Atari ST and Amiga as well as the Sega Master System, and Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi for the Sega Genesis, which significantly changed a lot of aspects about the game.[CR]Taking place 20 years after the original Shinobi, It features the terrorist group "Asian Down" planting bombs throughout Miami and killing Hayate Musashi's friend Kato. This is a means to distract Hayate from their real intentions: using the top secret U.S. Government initiative "Space Shuttle Olympia", (which they have already found out about and captured) to control a nuclear satellite attack system. This forces Hayate and his (then unnamed) canine companion to spring into action by disarming the bombs, returning government property, and generally kicking ass in his own personal War on Terrorism. Also as a series first, the last boss/primary antagonist (and Head of Operations over at Asian Down) is female.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay is very similar to that of the Shinobi games except now the player has the addition of a dog for a game mechanic. The dog is able to harass enemies, some of which are very difficult to kill otherwise. When the dog is hurt, it shrinks into a puppy and is unable to do any attacking until the next power-up is found. In the Arcade version, the shinobi dog can only initiate an attack if the player is crouching and the dog is barking.[CR]Throughout each stage in the game there are a number of bombs that must be disarmed before they Hayate can face the boss. The ninja's main weapon is an unlimited supply of throwing stars combined with punches and kicks when he gets close to enemies. Ninja Magic can also be performed once each level which will kill all enemies on screen, or in the case of a boss deal severe damage. A single power-up also exists which upgrades the throwing stars into energy bolts and allows the ninja to perform more powerful sword slashes.[CR]The game contains 4 rounds which are divided into subsections totaling 15 stages. Every round has only 1 regular stage and 1 boss stage. This differed slightly on the Sega Master System port of the game which was the shortest of all the versions. The Arcade version saw Hayate go up against a group of ninjas climbing down a building in the style of a first-person shooter. The Master System contains both the Arcade and the Sega Genesis versions of the bonus round.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level select[CR]When you turn on the game, hold down one the following on gamepad 2, to start on that level.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1991</releasedate>				<year>1991</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.8</rating>				<videoid>b790wPx5HmQ</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>5530</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570225-shadow-dancer</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/shadow-dancer</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/shadow-dancer/3030-11638/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/5530-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/5530-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/155417-shadow-dancer-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/57443-shadow-dancer-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/57444-shadow-dancer-sega-master-system-screenshot-map-of-level-1.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/57445-shadow-dancer-sega-master-system-screenshot-level-1.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/57446-shadow-dancer-sega-master-system-screenshot-using-magic.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/57447-shadow-dancer-sega-master-system-screenshot-level-1-boss.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/519081-shadow-dancer-sega-master-system-screenshot-level-2.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/519083-shadow-dancer-sega-master-system-screenshot-this-guy-throws.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/519085-shadow-dancer-sega-master-system-screenshot-no-level-without.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/519087-shadow-dancer-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-second-boss.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/519090-shadow-dancer-sega-master-system-screenshot-bonus-level-shoot.jpg</snapshot10>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/5530.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Shadow of the Beast (Europe)">				<description>Shadow of the Beast (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FShadow%20of%20the%20Beast%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="139638" />				<title_clean>Shadow of the Beast</title_clean>				<plot>While very young, Aarbron was kidnapped and enslaved by the Priests of the Beast Lord. He grew up on drugs made to destroy his own will and turn him into the Beast Messenger, a powerful creature serving Maletoth, The Beast Lord himself. He did his job, until one day he noticed a man about to be sacrificed in a ritual, his face triggering ancient memories... and as the sacrificial knife descended into the man's body, Aarbron recognizes the face. Of his father.[CR]As his father dies in the altar, memories of his childhood and tormented past at the hands of the Beast Lord emerged, and as feelings of hate over his captors took over him, he swore revenge and fled the temple, knowing the road to avenge his father and redemption would be hard.[CR]Shadow of the Beast, one of Psygnosis most popular titles during the 16-bit computer era is a side-scrolling platformer best known for the use of parallax scrolling along lush graphics, a musical score  by David Whittaker, a iconic cover by Roger Dean and what many consider to be unforgiving gameplay, balancing between the "very challenging" and the "impossible". The player has to navigate through several areas filled with enemies and traps, collecting keys and activating triggers than open new areas or give Aarbron the means to overcome a sub-boss. The number of moves the player has at disposal is limited: duck, jump and only two attacks: punch and a flying kick. While most enemies die with just one hit, the player must time each attack accurately. However, there are also traps of objects that cannot be destroyed, and these require the player to jump, duck or move according the sequence. The player has only one life with 12 hit points that can be replenished by collecting some objects hidden in the level (like an off-route location or a under a megalith), which also contributes to the difficulty level.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Life[CR]Drop a coin down the well at the start of Level 3 to get an extra life.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1992</releasedate>				<year>1992</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>Psygnosis Limited</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>Platform</perspective>				<rating>2.4</rating>				<videoid>2KmyfWn2SO8</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3007</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588138-shadow-of-the-beast-1992</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/shadow-of-the-beast</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/shadow-of-the-beast/3030-7681/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3007-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/89348-shadow-of-the-beast-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/89349-shadow-of-the-beast-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141632-shadow-of-the-beast-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141640-shadow-of-the-beast-sega-master-system-screenshot-thy-fate.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141635-shadow-of-the-beast-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-beast.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141638-shadow-of-the-beast-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-bleak.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141639-shadow-of-the-beast-sega-master-system-screenshot-hitting.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141641-shadow-of-the-beast-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-inventory.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141642-shadow-of-the-beast-sega-master-system-screenshot-giant-claws.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141644-shadow-of-the-beast-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-nasty.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2729101-7256010456-YD6WR.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2729100-7338546149-ca7qZ.jpg</snapshot10>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/3007.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Shanghai (USA, Europe)">				<description>Shanghai (USA, Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FShanghai%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" size="72088" />				<title_clean>Shanghai</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shanghai is a board game where the goal is to remove tiles from the board by selecting pairs of currently "free" tiles, defined as any tile with a side free (other than the front) that can be removed from the table without disturbing its neighboring tiles. If the player is able to remove every tile on the board without getting stymied by locked tiles, they win the game. Though circles, bamboos, characters and dragons must be removed in identical pairs, a flower can be paired off with any other flower and the same is also the case for seasons. This is because there is only one flower/season tile each.[CR]Shanghai is frequently mistaken for the game of Mahjong, which is considerably more in-depth and plays more like the card game Rummy.

If the player is able to remove every tile on the board without getting stymied by locked tiles, they win the game. Though circles, bamboos, characters and dragons must be removed in identical pairs, a flower can be paired off with any other flower and the same is also the case for seasons. This is because there is only one flower/season tile each.[CR]Shanghai is frequently mistaken for the game of Mahjong, which is considerably more in-depth and plays more like the card game Rummy.

He is the only one that knows about the alien invasion. Hence, he starts a journey to stop Aliens' evil plans and defend the earth. Although, this is the first Simpsons game, the plot has little to do with the show's material. Regardless, many of the show's characters make an appearance.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In each level, Bart is faced with various objectives that he has to accomplish and certain items that he has to collect before proceeding to the level boss. These objectives vary in each level, and most of them reflect Bart's personality in the show.Bart can activate X-Ray vision to identify humans who have been abducted by aliens. By jumping on them, Bart can collect letters that form the name of the level assistant. If he forms the whole name, then that character will provide assistance in fighting the level's boss. For instance, in the first level, if Bart collects all the letters of "Maggie", she will help him fight Nelson, the level's boss, by throwing Bowling balls.There are various items that Bart can buy and use as weapons or to cause a special event. These items include Slingshots, Sprays, Rockets, Whistles, Magnets, Coins, etc. Some of the items are used in many clever ways. For instance, if players blow the whistle in front of the retirement home, Grandpa Simpson will come out and start throwing money.The game is considered to be very difficult. The lack of saves, continues, or check points increase the game's challenge. In addition, for each life, Bart can only be hit two times before dying; players only start with three lives. Finally, most of the enemies can only be avoided, not killed.There are numerous small additions and details added to the game; for example, in the third level (The Carnival), Players can take part in most of the carnival activities. Players can even buy a magnet and use it to cheat in the "spin the wheel" minigame.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Level oneLocation: SpringfieldBoss: Nelson MuntzHelper: MaggieLevel twoLocation: Shopping MallBoss: Ms. BotzHelper: MargeLevel threeLocation: CarnivalBoss: Sideshow BobHelper: LisaLevel fourLocation: MuseumSub-Boss: TyrannosaurusBoss: Dr. MonroeHelper: HomerLevel fiveLocation: Power PlantHelper: Maggie, Marge, Lisa, and HomerNo Boss[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All Stage Passwords.[CR]Stage 1 : [B]14[/B] [CR]Stage 2 : [B]32[/B] [CR]Stage 3 : [B]11[/B] [CR]Stage 4 : [B]41[/B] [CR]Stage 5 : [B]21[/B][CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Bonus Screen[CR]Go to the theater between 2:00 and 4:00 and you will find a secret screen.

Mr. Smithers rigged the contest for Mr. Burns to get rid of his "worst enemies" the Simpsons. Burns hopes to do this by sending many agents to the different places where Bart will go (4 places in all: China, Egypt, the North Pole and Hollywood) where Bart has to survive the different attacks from the evil duo's agents.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Gear version was released in 1993 Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 7,6,7 and 7 out of ten. Sushi-X, who gave a 7 wrote, "This cart is a big improvement over previous Simpsons' titles for the Game Gear. The graphics are excellent and are very bright and colorful. The sounds are really good too. There is a lot more variety to the game play and the control is very responsive. Of course the humor of Bart and his wacky friends is rampant throughout the game. Overall this is another quality Game Gear cart and Simpsons' fans should take note".[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1993</releasedate>				<year>1993</year>				<genre>Action, Simulation, Sports,

It was the first game in the  Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, and also the first game developed by  Sonic Team. It was released in 1991 in North America, Europe and Japan. It is one of the best selling video games of all time, and thus a giant money maker for  Sega, creating a popular evergreen franchise and also propelled the Genesis to widespread popularity.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]As with most games of the era, the majority of the game's plot is contained within the instruction manual. Essentially, Doctor Robotnik is capturing all of the animals on Sonic's home of South Island to act as power sources for his robot army, and he desires the power of the six mystical  Chaos Emeralds to help further his world domination plot. Sonic doesn't like the sound of this, and sets off to rescue his animal friends and collect the emeralds before Robotnik.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In the game the player takes control of Sonic (the Hedgehog) who is tasked with preventing Doctor Ivo Robotnik - or Doctor Eggman in Japan - from taking all 6  Chaos Emeralds in order to rule South Island, by instead collecting them himself. Sonic travels through 21 acts, split into 7 zones with 3 acts each. At the end of the third act of each zone the player fights against Doctor Robotnik in one of his many vehicles. The twist is Sonic's ability to run at extreme speeds which allows him to go through levels with loops, springs, high falls, and extreme slopes; and he must avoid rows of sharp spikes, bottomless pits, enemies, and other obstacles. Sonic has two attack moves: a spinning jump and spinning roll, and he can use both of these to combat enemies, break through certain walls, and smash open power-ups.[CR] Gold rings are scattered around the map - similar, but quite different, to  coins in  Super Mario Bros. Collecting 100 rings gives the player an extra life - similar to how collecting 100 coins in  Super Mario Bros. garners the player a  1up. Rings also act as a layer of protection against traps, as Sonic will drop all his rings upon coming into contact with a trap, only losing a life if he has no rings when it happens.Levels[CR]There are six different zones (levels) contained in Sonic The Hedgehog, each of which has its own unique aesthetic. There are three acts to each zone. They are: Green Hill ZoneDr. Robotnik, as the first boss in a Sonic game.[CR]This first zone sees the first appearance of some famous Sonic trademarks. Players whirl through checkered  loop-de-loops and speed past  palm trees against a vibrant and colorful background. At the end of act three, Dr. Robotnik shows up in a pendulum-like device that swings a large ball back and forth across the screen. Marble Zone[CR]This zone puts players in an ancient ruin that is apparently in close proximity to a  volcano. Players are forced to avoid  lava  lakes and waterfalls and they jump from platform to platform. After, Dr. Robotnik arrives with a  flamethrower mounted under his ship and proceeds to drop flames on the two platforms, which are on either end of the screen. Spring Yard ZoneThe Spring Yard Zone[CR]This mountainous zone places the player in a giant  pinball themed stage. Players must push through copious bumpers and avoid steep slopes as they make their way to the end of act three, where Dr. Robotnik waits. Here, he has a giant spike attached to the bottom of his ship and proceeds to break apart the platforms the player walks on, effectively making this battle harder the longer it goes on. Labyrinth Zone[CR]Here, players are put into an ancient maze that has sunken into the sea. This is arguably the most difficult stage in the game, as players are introduced to a new gameplay mechanic,  water. While submerged, the player can jump higher, but is slower and will drown if an air bubble is not consumed every so often. At the end of this zone, players must chase Dr. Robotnik through a vertical corridor, while avoiding  spears and, of course, the rising  water level. Star Light ZoneStar Light Zone[CR]This starry zone is set amongst an aerial construction site. Players will have to avoid some high-powered fans that will impede their progress, and will have to utilise others to advance in the level. At the end of act three, players will have to use see-saw like devices in order to hurls spike balls up at Dr. Robotnik, who will continuously drop spike balls down on the player. Scrap Brain Zone[CR]The final zone of the game is set in one of Dr. Robotnik&#8217;s grimy, polluted industrious cities. Players will have to avoid saws and traverse conveyor belts as they make their way through the level. In act three, players have to re-live an environment similar to that in the Labyrinth Zone. This area, however, has a certain touch of Dr. Robotnik about it. The water is polluted, and the walls a dull grey. Once players finish this, they will face off against Dr. Robotnik in the  final boss battle of the game. Here, there are four pistons. Two pistons will simultaneously move and try to crush the player, the doctor will appear in one of these and it is up to the player to use their reflexes in order to hit the right one.[CR]If the player completes the game with none or only a few Chaos Emeralds, Dr. Robotnik will taunt the player triumphantly juggling the leftover Emeralds and challenge the player to "Try Again." To get the good ending, the player will need to have obtained all 6 Emeralds, which can only be acquired from the game's 6 Special Stages.Secret Zones[CR]If the player has 50 or more rings at the end of any act, Sonic can warp to the secret zone by jumping through the giant golden ring. Sonic's  spin attack allows him to ricochet off the spinning  maze. The aim is to grab the  Chaos Emerald from the middle of the maze.[CR]There are six Chaos Emeralds to find, one in each of the secret zones, if the player collects them all it will unlock an alternative ending to the game.[CR]Items &amp; Objects[CR] Rings: As long as Sonic has rings he will not lose a life if he is hit by an enemy, he will simply spill the rings on the ground and he will have a time limited opportunity to recollect them. If he is hit when he has no rings, he will lose a life. Lamp Posts: The only checkpoint system in the game, when Sonic crosses through a lamp post the player's score and time are recorded. If the player loses a life Sonic will restart the current act at the last lamp post he activated.[CR](The following items are obtained by smashing video monitors with Sonic's spin attack)Super Ring: Equivalent to 10 or more rings.Shield: Protects Sonic from losing rings by protecting him from one attack.Power Sneakers: Enables Sonic to run at super sonic speed, and increases the tempo of the music to give an extra sense of speed. 1-Ups: Gives Sonic an extra live. Invincible: Makes Sonic invulnerable to enemy attacks for a short period of time.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Music for Sonic the Hedgehog was composed by  Masato Nakamura, Bass Guitarist for Japanese Pop Music band Dreams Come True. Masato would mail each song on cassette to Sega's offices, where they would then translate the melody to a music format the Sega Genesis could understand. A number of songs submitted were based off of similar melodies found in popular Dreams Come True tracks.[CR]Development History[CR]Rabbit Concept Art[CR]On April of 1990 Sega held a contest internally among development teams in an effort to create a game to define the company. Sega's AM8 development studio (later renamed to  Sonic Team) decided that the game should be fast, but simple to control. Many design ideas were tossed around - a bulldog, a rabbit that picked objects up with his ears - but the decision came down to the act of the character rolling in to a ball and down hills to gain speed. It eventually came down to a hedgehog or an  armadillo - and in the end, the hedgehog won out. Initially called "Mr. Needlemouse", he was brought to Sega of America's marketing teams for further refinement.Very early concept art by Naoto Oshima.[CR]"Mr. Needlemouse" was originally the hard-edged lead singer in a rock and roll band, tasked with rescuing a groupie named Madonna, a human female who was apparently in love with the Hedgehog. Madonna was to be captured by "Dr. Badvibes", leading to our hero to leap in to action. Sega of America requested a number of changes, including tweaks to Mr. Needlemouse's look to soften up his thuggish appearance, the removal of the "rock band" aspect, and a name change to Sonic the Hedgehog.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Sonic was originally a light shade of blue, however testers had a difficult time telling Sonic apart from the blue sky. One of the last changes made to the game before being shipped was to change Sonic's palette to a much darker shade of cobalt in order to make him stand out better.Though the concept of a Rabbit that picks up and throws objects with his ears was rejected for Sonic, the concept was revisited by Sonic Team and eventually became  Ristar: The Shooting Star.The Armadillo concept also resurfaced later in  SegaSonic the Hedgehog for Arcades and  Knuckles Chaotix on the 32X, as the character  Mighty The Armadillo.The "Sonic the Hedgehog Rock &amp; Roll Band" concept was initially supposed to be kept for the game's fully-featured sound test mode, where Sonic and crew would play their instruments along with the game's soundtrack. This animation had to be removed in order to make room for the iconic "SEGA!" voice chime when the game first starts up, which Yuji Naka reportedly felt was a more impressive technological feat.Everybody has been "in a band" at some point in their life - even Sonic.Members of Sonic the Hedgehog's long lost Band include Sharps the Chicken on lead Guitar, Mach the Rabbit on Drums, Max the Monkey on Bass, and  Vector the Crocodile on Keyboards. Vector the Crocodile would return as a character in  Knuckles Chaotix, and later became a staple of the Sonic roster with games like  Sonic Heroes and  Shadow the Hedgehog.The Game Gear/Master System version of Sonic the Hedgehog still features an animated image of Sonic standing at a microphone for its Sound Test.Much of this game's art style was inspired by early 3D Graphics work. In the  Sonic Jam Official Japanese Strategy Guide (written personally by Sonic Team), Yuji Naka recalls that the team had a difficult time recreating the angular, vectorized 3D graphics visual style using hand-drawn pixel artwork.According to designer Naoto Oshima in an interview with  Gametap, Sonic the Hedgehog's design was inspired by  Michael Jackson's cool sense of style and  Bill Clinton's no-nonsense, "Get it Done" attitude. The color scheme for Sonic's trademark shoes were apparently inspired by Santa Claus' red/white motif.In one of the first Japanese television commercials for this game, Sonic is shown to pilot a space ship where he drops a bomb on to what appears to be a parody of the Death Star, remade to look like Dr. Eggman's face. This concept was later re-used for Sonic the Hedgehog 2, where Dr. Eggman builds a nearly identical looking space station called the Death Egg.[CR]World Records[CR] Twin Galaxies is the world authority on video game world records and below are the variations/records tracked for Sonic the Hedgehog.812,140 [Tournament Settings, 5 Lives Only] by Michael Sroka38min. 12sec. [Minimalist Speed Run] by Jared Oswald1hr 3min 7sec [Fastest Full Completion, All Emeralds] by Jared Oswald[CR]SEGA Master System and Game Gear version[CR][B]Overview:[/B] and differencesMaster System Box Art[CR]Sonic The Hedgehog on the  Master System is similar to the Mega Drive/  Genesis version in some respects, but is overall a very different game.Unlike the 16-bit version Sonic cannot recollect rings after being damaged by an enemy.The Chaos Emeralds appear in the levels as opposed to appearing in the Special Stages which only contain rings.With the exception of Scrap Brain Zone (Act 3) no boss zones contain rings or  Badniks. This made the  boss fights much more difficult than they were on the 16-bit version of the game.The  Game Gear version features sign posts warning the player of upcoming  spike pits. This is because the Game Gear screen was much smaller and narrower than a TV screen, making the game slightly harder.[CR]There is one Continue hidden in each of the eight Special Stages, unlike the 16-bit version where gaining a Continue was based on the player's ring count.Levels[CR]Each level (also known as Zones or Rounds according to the back of the game box) are made up of three acts. The third act in each zone contains that zones boss which is always Dr. Robotnik in different machine. In addition to these levels there are eight Special Stages. These can be accessed by beating any of the first two acts of a level with 50 or more rings.[CR]Zones in play though order:Green Hill ZoneBridge ZoneJungle ZoneLabyrinth ZoneScrap Brain ZoneSky Base ZoneVaried level designs[CR]Sonic The Hedgehog on the Master System/Game Gear contains two zones that contain unique design elements for the series.[CR]The first one is Bridge Zone (Act 2) which features a  scrolling screen that moves independently of the player. This effectively forces the player to keep moving until the end of the zone, but also means that the player cannot speed through the zone in true Sonic style. The other unique zone is Jungle Zone (Act 2), which features a  vertical design rather than the traditional horizontal layout. The screen adjusts as Sonic moves up the zone but it does not go back down, so touching the bottom of the screen results in  instant death.[CR]Updated Releases[CR]GBA Release[CR]Sonic the Hedgehog was ported to the  Game Boy Advance in 2006. This iteration of the game features the same 6 zones, as well an added spin-dash move and a save feature. The graphics are not down scaled in any way, and look the same as the original Genesis version. This GBA port of Sonic the Hedgehog is considered to be very broken and inaccurately recreates the Genesis title, with choppy frame rate issues and graphical and collision errors.iPhone ReleaseThe iOS version of the game can be played using either touch controls or the accelerometer[CR]A port of the original Sonic the Hedgehog game was released onto the iPhone on May 20, 2009 by Sega America. The port features all of the original graphics and sounds and originally sold for $5.99 USD on Apple 's App Store. The controls for the iPhone version use a virtual D-Pad along with a virtual "A" Button. The iPhone and iPod Touch versions of Sonic the Hedgehog feature 7 different zones to play through. There are also two ways to display the game: Full Screen or "Arcade" mode.[CR]This version of the game was eventually updated and released as an iPad app as well.Android Release[CR]On May 16, 2013 the game was released to the Android platform, costing $2.99/&#163;1.99/&#8364;2.69/AUD$2.99, the same as the iOS version at the time of release. This version of the game was updated for Google&#8217;s mobile operating system with widescreen support and a 60 fps frame rate, as well as a remastered soundtrack, leaderboards and achievements. This update also allows players to unlock Tails and Knuckles as playable characters.[CR]SEGA also announced that the updates this iteration of the game debuted would be released to the iOS version of the game under the form of an update. An update released on May 16th in the US App Store, and on May 15th in certain international App Stores, read as follows:[CR]- Enhanced graphics, performance, and sound![CR]- New unlockable characters![CR]**Note: This is an all-new port of Sonic The Hedgehog!

Sonic 2 is very similar to the original, but builds on many of the concepts and ideas introduced in the first title while piling on nearly twice the number of levels. The most drastic change was the introduction of a sidekick, Miles "Tails" Prower. The new character allowed a simple 2-player competitive mode, borrowing levels from the single player to add a much needed multi-player component. Tails could also follow Sonic around in single player mode, and could be controlled by plugging in a second Genesis gamepad.Sonic gets a sidekick.[CR]Arguably the most dramatic improvement is the implementation of the Spin-dash. By ducking and pressing the jump button, Sonic would rev up in ball form. After revving up enough, the player could stop pressing down to get a burst of speed while staying rolled into a ball. Beyond those two additions, however, gameplay for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 remains relatively the same; the goal is still to get to the end of a level as quickly as possible, while destroying as many enemies and collecting as many rings as possible. Rather than having three acts and a boss fight (as in Sonic 1), Sonic 2 features only two acts per level, with some exceptions (Metropolis Zone features three acts, Sky Chase, Wing Fortress, and Death Egg all feature a single act each).[CR]Chaos Emeralds also returned from the original, offering up an additional 7th Emerald (instead of the original game's 6). The special stages were done on a endless half-pipe which Sonic ran forward on collecting rings and avoiding enemies. If he had enough rings when he hit the checkpoint then he would continue until eventually obtaining a Chaos Emerald. Collect all 7 and Sonic would be able to transform into Super Sonic. In this form Sonic becomes even faster and rather than his usual blue is colored a bright yellow.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Not content just exploring his home of South Island, Sonic the Hedgehog's adventures took him all over the globe. It was eventually he found himself at West-side Island, said to be home to a lost civilization. This civilization were given seven "Chaos Emeralds" of great power as a gift from the Gods. Eventually, this power corrupted the civilization, and this angered the Gods greatly. As punishment, they sealed the emeralds away in an alternate dimension called "The Special Zone".Sonic apparently didn't read the in-flight safety booklet.[CR]Intrigued, Sonic lands his biplane, the Tornado, on the island. It's here Sonic runs in to a shy, two-tailed fox named Miles - Sonic nicknames him "Tails" for obvious reasons. Tails, as it turns out, loves machinery, and he is fascinated by Sonic's plane. Before the two can get too acquainted, however, they hear an explosion in the distance. Doctor Ivo 'Eggman' Robotnik has followed Sonic to this island, and is tearing it apart looking for the Chaos Emeralds. He hopes they will act as an energy source for his greatest, most deadly creation: a giant, weaponized space station called the "Death Egg." Together, Sonic and Tails agree that Robotnik has to be stopped at all costs.[CR]Special Stage[CR]The Special Stage is played from behind Sonic in a 3D half-pipe. The player is given a target of the number of rings they have to collect as Sonic runs through the pipe whist avoiding the bombs. If the target is met then the stage continues, if not then the player returns to the level where they entered the Special Stage with a total of no rings. By meeting all the targets in the Special Stage, the stage is cleared and the player unlocks a Chaos Emerald. Each new Special Stage is harder than the one which preceded it and they have to be completed in order with no way to skip to the next one without completing the one previous.Tony Hawk ain't got nothin' on Sonic.[CR]After collecting all 7 Chaos Emeralds, compared to the total of 6 found in the Master System version, Sonic gains the ability to change into Super Sonic after collecting 50 rings. When Sonic becomes his super form he is virtually invincible, running and jumping much higher than normal, only able to be killed by drowning, being crushed, falling off the screen or by running out of time in the level. This added speed comes at a price as it makes it almost impossible to do precise jumps due to the increased speed as well as loosing 1 ring a second whilst in super form; with Sonic reverting back to his normal self when the rings reach zero and effectively making him a sitting duck to enemies.[CR]Two Player Versus Mode[CR]Sonic 2 also included a two versus player mode where, playing as either Sonic or Tails, two players can have a split screen race on one of 3 different zones or a Special Stage. In the regular zone races, on either Emerald Hill Zone, Casino Night Zone or Mystic Cave Zone, players are ranked in 5 different areas with the highest score winning the round. On the Special Stage the winner is the one who collects the most rings. In the case of a tie in the regular zones a Special Stage is then ran to determine a winner. Two player mode also added a couple of new item boxes. One being a teleporter which switched the two players around, the other being a Dr. Robotnik item which damaged the player that found it.[CR]Compatibility with Sonic &amp; Knuckles[CR]Sonic 2 &amp; Knuckles![CR]By slotting the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 cart into the top of the Sonic &amp; Knuckles Lock-on featured cart the player could play as Knuckles in Sonic 2. The game is essentially exactly the same with the player playing as Knuckles instead of either Sonic or Tails. He can glide and climb walls but due to his inferior jumping ability some boss fights are more difficult as Knuckles. There are a few minor differences in the way Star Post checkpoints are handled however as when returning to a level after a Special Stage the player would keep the rings they had before they went in, whereas in the default game all rings were lost. The same applies when a life is lost.Re-releases[CR]The Genesis version of this game was re-released on:Sonic Compilation on the Mega Drive in EuropeSonic 3-in-1 on the Genesis in North AmericaSega Smash Pack 2 on the PCReal Arcade on the PCSonic Mega Collection on the Nintendo GamecubeSonic Mega Collection Plus on the PS2, Xbox and PCSonic Genesis Collection on the PS2 and PSPWii Virtual ConsoleXbox Live Arcade MarketplaceSonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PS3[CR]Numerous mobile phone versions also exist.[CR]Zones[CR]Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has 11 zones, plus one special stage. This is twice as many as the original Sonic, which had 6 zones. However, a big difference this time around is that most of the zones have two acts instead of three. This is not a hard and fast rule though, as the Metropolis Zone had 3 acts and both the Death Egg Zone and the Wing Fortress zones had only one.Emerald Hill ZoneThe Emerald Hill Zone[CR]This zone is similar to the Green Hill Zone of the previous Sonic game. It&#8217;s set in a tropical resort that features many trees, green hills and wildlife-themed enemies. Dr. Robotnik appears here in a vehicle with a giant mechanical drill attached to the front. He travels back and forth in an attempt to impale the player, and due to this simplistic process, he is therefore relatively easy to defeat.Chemical Plant ZoneThe Chemical Plant Zone[CR]This zone is set in a bustling industrial city that is flooded with a neon pink liquid, Sonic can survive while submerged in this, but only for a limited time since there are no air bubbles. Dr. Robotnik makes his appearance with a suction tube clipped onto the bottom of his ship, which he uses to extract toxic materials from the liquid below, which he will then attempt to drop on the player. The player must attempt to avoid these attacks while remaining on the platform, which features panels that will successively rotate.Aquatic Ruin ZoneThe Aquatic Ruin Zone[CR]This zone is set in the half-submerged, swampy remains of a crumbling ruin. Players who fall into the water will find that they have a harder time than those who were skillful enough to stay dry, as the underwater path is significantly harder than the land path. Robotnik appears here with a giant mallet attached to his ship, he will hit down on two columns that flank the player on either side of street, causing them to shoot out arrows. The player must use these arrows as platforms in order to be able to reach Robotnik and bring him down.Casino Night ZoneThe Casino Night Zone[CR]This zone is reminiscent of the Spring Yard Zone of Sonic 1, in that it is set up to be a giant casino themed pinball table. Of course, this means the player must try and get past obstacles such as bumpers and slot machines in their attempt to reach Dr. Robotnik. He appears here at the bottom of a pinball table, with a set of electric pincers on the bottom of his ship. He uses this to drop bombs on the player, so staying on the ground is inadvisable. Instead, the player must spin dash up to, and utilize, the bumpers in order to hurl themselves at Robotnik.Hill Top ZoneThe Hill Top Zone[CR]This zone is set just above the clouds, on top of a set of hills. Sonic must cross over the top of the hills, and then delve down into it to face pools of magma and earthquakes, which makes the floor rise from under him. Here, the doctor emerges from the lava in a heat proof submarine with a flamethrower attached on top. He will repeatedly emerge from the lava and attempt to shoot the player with flames, which also sets the ground on fire. The player must strike out at Robotnik once he emerges from the lava, while avoiding the jet stream of flames.Mystic Cave ZoneThe Mystic Cave Zone[CR]This underground zone is set in a deep cave, which is covered in crystals. Sonic must swing from vines and avoid being crushed by crystals while they progress on their way to Dr. Robotnik. If the player manages to get through this stage, they are greeted at the end by Robotnik, who has a pair of drills attached on either side of ship. He uses these to drill into the ceiling and create sharp debris that will fall on the player if they&#8217;re not careful.Oil Ocean ZoneThe Oil Ocean Zone[CR]This zone is a giant oil refinery which features pools of thick oil that that the player can skim across. The oil is a double-edged sword, however, as while players can use it, if they are not careful they can sink into it and lose a life. Robotnik appears here in a submarine similar to the one he uses in the Hill Top Zone, but instead of a flamethrower, he now has a laser cannon that is much more lethal. Another new tactic he uses is that when submerged, he will send out a claw that travels over one of the platforms on the screen.Metropolis ZoneThe Metropolis Zone[CR]This is the only stage in the game to contain three distinct acts. This massive, construction themed, zone features corkscrews, copious spikes, magma and, of course, industrial themed moving platforms. After players make the lengthy excursion to the end of act three, they will predictably find Dr. Robotnik there. This time, he is surrounded by seven shaped pods, which rotate around him, creating a protective shield. Every time the player hits Robotnik, one of the pods will break off and transform into an inflatable copy of him, but these don&#8217;t pose a problem as they can be destroyed with a single hit. After all the pods have been destroyed, Robotnik will strafe across the screen with a laser beam. He is vulnerable in this state, however, as one more hit will send him packing.Sky Chase ZoneThe Sky Chase Zone[CR]This one act zone is set in the sky, as Sonic rides on top of Tail&#8217;s plane, the Tornado. Throughout the stage, Sonic&#8217;s partner will remain under Sonic wherever he goes, so falling isn&#8217;t a problem here. The player comes up against a variety of aerial themed enemies, but when they get to the end they will find that there is no boss in this stage.Wing Fortress ZoneThe Wing Fortress Zone[CR]Tails' plane, the Tornado, takes a hit and begins to fall to the ground. Sonic bails out and lands on Robotnik&#8217;s Wing Fortress. This flying citadel has many different traps and enemies, but the biggest threat to the player is falling off the screen, as this can be done a little too easily. Here, Robotnik has built a contraption to do the fighting for him. He locks Sonic within an energy field, and along with Sonic there is a laser cannon which strafes to and fro across the top of the screen, attempting to periodically fry the player. Along with the cannon, there are three flying spike platforms that bounce off the walls. The player must use these as a platform in order to reach and damage the sensitive cannon, while avoid their spiked sides.Death Egg ZoneMecha Sonic's first appearance, in the last stage of Sonic 2[CR]After the fight in the Wing Fortress Zone, Sonic chases Dr. Robotnik into the Death Egg. This, ringless, zone consists of two separate bosses. The first is Mecha Sonic, this doppelganger has some of Sonic&#8217;s moves, as he jumps and spin dashes across the stage. The player must hit him in the head while he stands still in order to damage him.The Final Boss, Dr. Robotnik[CR]After a few hits, Mecha Sonic goes down, and Sonic progresses into the next room for his final confrontation with Dr. Robotnik. The giant robot he appears in lumbers slowly around the arena, but the lower half of said monstrosity is invulnerable. The only way the player can reach the breakable upper half is to wait for the right moment. After trudging around for a bit, Robotnik rockets off the top of the screen, causing a target to appear over Sonic. When the target begins flashing, the giant egg bot is about to come crashing down. Immediately after landing, the machine lurches forward presenting the only safe opportunity to attack. But the player has to be careful as every other fall, he'll fire off his spiked arms which are near impossible to avoid unless Sonic is out of reach. After twelve hits Robotnik will go down, and the ending of the game begins.Hidden Palace ZoneHidden Palace Zone[CR]By using a Game Genie, it is in fact possible to get into the Hidden Palace Zone in the retail version on Sonic the Hedgehog 2. The code to unlock it is ACLA-ATD4 and then going into level select and pressing A and Start together when highlighting the Death Egg Zone. The level is obviously unfinished and cannot be completed without creating the Egg Prison item in debug mode. Bits of the level design seen in the numerous Beta versions of the game are still there including the infamous 'Master Emerald' block. All level art seen in previous Betas have been deleted presumably to save cartridge space and most of the textures as a result are just a glitched mess. In the background however, art from the Oil Ocean Zone can be seen. In the 2013 iOS and Android release of the game, this level was finally added into the game.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Sonic the Hedgehog 2's soundtrack was composed by returning musician Masato Nakamura, bass guitarist for Japanese Pop-music band Dreams Come True. The song that plays after Sonic defeats the final boss (but before the credits roll) is in fact a karaoke version of a Dreams Come True song known as "Sweet Sweet Sweet" (or, as its known in America, "Sweet Dream"), from their triple-platinum album "The Swinging Star."[CR]Development History[CR]Sonic the Hedgehog 2 nearly did not happen. After completing Sonic the Hedgehog, Yuji Naka resigned from Sega of Japan. Sega of Japan paid its employees based purely on how long they had been employed at the company, and given that Yuji Naka was still relatively new, he was not being paid very much, despite having worked on one of the most prominent titles for the company. He was lured to America by Mark Cerny, who worked for the Sega Technical Institute (STI). STI was formed to help bridge the gap between the relatively new American game developers and the seasoned Japanese game developers. Yuji Naka and most of SonicTeam agreed to take part in this, and officially, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was started at STI, featuring a mixture of Japanese and American developers and designers.[CR]Like the original Sonic the Hedgehog, a Character Design contest was held, this time to give Sonic a sidekick. The winner was Yasushi Yamaguchi's "Miles Prower" design. However, most of the team agreed that the character should be renamed to "Tails". Yasushi fought hard to keep the name as "Miles", even going so far as to make sure in-game art assets all read "Miles" instead of "Tails". Eventually, the team decided on a compromise - though the character's full name would be "Miles Prower", most people would call him "Tails" as a nickname.[CR]Initially, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was planned for the Sega Genesis, Sega Game Gear (which was also ported to the Master System), and an enhanced port to the Sega CD. All versions of the game were slated to feature Time Travel in some capacity. As the projects went on, however, Sonic 2 for the Sega CD began to drift rather heavily from its Sega Genesis and Sega Game Gear counterparts. Eventually, Sonic 2 for the Sega CD was re-named altogether to become its own separate Sonic game, titled Sonic CD and Sonic 2 for the Sega Genesis dropped the Time Travel gimmick. Sonic 2 on the Game Gear existed as sort of a middle ground in between it all; it features remixes of music from the Japanese version of Sonic CD, and a plot where Tails gets kidnapped (instead of Sonic CD's Amy Rose). Unused footage for a Sonic CD video sequence gives a brief look at an Antlion Robot very similar to the first boss of Sonic 2 for the Game Gear.[CR]8-bit Master System/Game Gear Game[CR]Master System Box Shot[CR]A month before the release of the 16-bit Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Mega Drive/Genesis on October 29, 1992, an 8-bit game called Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was released for the Sega Master System on October 16, 1992. It was released exclusively for PAL territories, such as Europe and South America, regions where the Master System was popular. It was followed by a port to the Sega Game Gear handheld, in PAL regions on October 29, 1992, followed by a North American release in November 1992.[CR]Sega outsourced its development to Aspect, another Japanese company, which created a very different game from similar concepts.[CR]Being released before the 16-bit version for the Mega Drive/Genesis, the 8-bit editions of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 represented the debut of character Miles "Tails" Prower, who became a recurring character in the series.[CR]The Master System version was released for the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console on November 18, 2008 in Japan, in North America on December 8, 2008and in the PAL regions on December 26, 2008.Storyline[CR]Tails has been kidnapped by the evil Dr. Robotnik. In order to guarantee his safe return, Sonic must stop Dr. Robotnik, thwart his evil plans, rescue Tails and retrieve the 6 Chaos Emeralds.Synopsis[CR]South Island has been peaceful since Dr. Robotnik's defeat. Sonic, bored, decides to go on a journey in search of other adventures. Upon his return, he is shocked to find the island nearly abandoned. The only clue as to where all his friends might have disappeared to is a single note, written by his two-tailed fox buddy, Miles "Tails" Prower. In the note, Tails explains that he's been kidnapped by Dr. Robotnik and is being held in a place called Crystal Egg. The price for Tails' safe return are the 6 Chaos Emeralds, to be delivered to 6 new boss robots. Thus, Sonic goes on a quest to find the Chaos Emeralds and rescue Tails.Gameplay[CR]The gameplay of Sonic 2 on the Master System/Game Gear was very different to the Genesis version. However, it was greatly updated in comparison to the original Sonic game also released on the Master System.[CR]It featured the ability to collect back up rings that Sonic had dropped when he was hit by an enemy as well as being able to smash through some walls by running into them. The game also featured levels where Sonic was required to ride along in a mine cart or fly a hand-glider. There was also a large bubble in the underwater levels which would allow Sonic to float upwards till he hit the ceiling or an enemy as well as the ability for Sonic to run on water provided he had enough speed; a feature absent from the 16-bit Genesis version of Sonic 2 but later implemented in Sonic 3.[CR]There were 7 zones in the game in total, each made of 3 Acts, with a prize panel being spun at the end of Acts 1 and 2 in which Sonic could earn an extra life. a continue, plus 10 rings or nothing, depending on which picture it landed on. Act 3 is the zones end level boss where Sonic must usually defeat a variety of robotic animals in order to proceed to the next zone.[CR]If the player manages to collect 5 Chaos Emeralds as they progress through the game, when they Mecha Sonic and defeat him they will be given the 6th Emerald and go on to fight Dr. Robotnik in Act 3 of the next and final zone, the Crystal Egg Zone. Defeating Dr. Robotnik here will unlock the "Good Ending". Failure to collect all 5 Chaos Emeralds before the encounter with Mecha Sonic will result in the game ending after his destruction and the player receiving the "Bad Ending" in which it is assumed that Dr. Robotnik has killed Sonic's friend Tails.Development[CR]Sonic the Hedgehog 2 received preview coverage in the October 1992 issue of GamePro.[CR]The Game Gear's lower screen resolution results in the Game Gear version having a smaller visible screen area than the Master System edition, causing some fans to consider the Game Gear version the more challenging title. For example, when facing the boss of the Underground Zone, the reduced screen area either side of Sonic gives the player less time to react to hazards moving onto the screen. Other bosses were also affected: the Green Hills Zone battle takes place in a smaller, steeper arena; there is a 3rd chute which cannot be seen while fighting Robotnik in the final Crystal Egg stage. The music for the intro sequence is also different. The Game Gear version uses the Scrambled Egg Zone music for the scene showing Robotnik escaping with the captive Tails and the Master System intro music for the title. The boss music is also different between the two versions. The Master System version used a single theme for the endings while a new good ending theme was added for the Game Gear version.[CR]The Game Gear version also features dark blue (instead of green) water in the second Act of the Aqua Lake Zone, and omits the game's only "Speed Shoes" item box, which may be found only in the Master System version of this stage. In the Game Gear version in power-up's original location is a Ring item box instead, thus rendering the item unused in said port.Soundtrack[CR]The music for Green Hills Zone was later used as the theme song for the Japanese and European versions of Sonic the Hedgehog CD, where it is called "Sonic: You Can Do Anything". A remix of the tune is also used for Mecha Green Hill Zone in Sonic the Hedgehog Chaos.Re-releases[CR]The Sega Master System/Game Gear game was re-released on:Sonic Mega Collection (2002) (GameCube, PS2, Xbox, PC)Sonic Adventure DX (2003) (GameCube, PC)Sonic Gems Collection (2005) (GameCube, PS2)[CR]The game was later re-released on Nintendo's Virtual Console service, with the Master System version released for the Wii Virtual Console in December 2008 and the Game Gear version released for the Nintendo 3DS eShop in June 2013.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The design for The Death Egg in this game most likely came from a Japanese TV commercial for the original Sonic the Hedgehog, wherein Sonic pilots a space ship to destroy a massive space station similar to Star Wars' own Death Star, but modified to look like Dr. Eggman's face.Early beta versions of the game reveal that, at one point, even more levels were planned for Sonic 2, including Wood Zone, a stage set in leafy tree tops, and Dust Hill Zone, a western-themed stage full of cacti and desert-dwelling robots. Hidden Palace Zone, not to be confused with the Sonic &amp; Knuckles stage of the same name, also exists in the beta version, along side an unplayable entry for a "Genocide City Zone". The stage "Neo Green Hill Zone" also exists, though selecting it from a stage-select menu takes Sonic to Aquatic Ruin Zone, possibly suggesting it originally went by a different name earlier in development.Interviews with various Sonic 2 graphics and level designers reveal even more cut levels never seen publicly: A recolored version of Dust Hill Zone to transform the sand in to snow, a Rock Zone, and a level called Cyber City Zone, possibly another name for Genocide City Zone. Genocide/Cyber City was supposed to take place between Metropolis Zone and Sky Chase, but time ran out - what work was completed on Genocide/Cyber City became Metropolis Zone Act 3.Level layouts from the cut level Wood Zone match up with level layouts for Metropolis Zone, possibly hinting at Sonic 2's now lost time travel feature. This suggests that Wood Zone would have possibly been what Metropolis Zone looked like in the distant past.Many of the resources made for deleted Sonic 2 levels eventually made it in to Sonic Spinball, another Sega Technical Institute game. Tiles for Hidden Palace Zone can be seen in the background for Toxic Caves, and graphics for a level called "The Machine" match up with concept art drawn for Cyber City Zone.Furthering the lost connection between Sonic 2 and Sonic CD, artwork of Sonic CD's "Little Planet" showcases areas on the planet that represent all levels present in the game, save for the top-right corner of the planet: A desert region, covered in cactus, reminiscent of this game's Dust Hill Zone.By collecting all seven chaos emeralds and fifty rings in a level, Sonic can transform in to the invincible Super Sonic form. Super Sonic is a bright golden yellow color with up-turned spikes, an obvious reference to Dragon Ball Z's Super Saiyan form. Yuji Naka was reportedly a big fan of Dragon Ball, and during his stay in America, had VHS tapes the latest episodes shipped to him weekly from overseas.Foxes, in Japanese folklore, are mischievous mythological beings sometimes refered to as a "Kitsune" (pronounced "Kit-Sue-Ney"). As a Kitsune ages, it grows additional tails, up to a maximum of nine. Additional tails on a Kitsune represent the level of mystical energy and intelligence within the being. Some stories say that a Kitsune will only grow a new tail every 1,000 years. A Kitsune with 9 tails is said to have infinite wisdom, and usually has fur that appears golden in color.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]Plug a Controller Pad into Slot 2 and Hold [B]UpperLeft+1+2[/B] as you turn on the console.

Sonic 2 is very similar to the original, but builds on many of the concepts and ideas introduced in the first title while piling on nearly twice the number of levels. The most drastic change was the introduction of a sidekick, Miles "Tails" Prower. The new character allowed a simple 2-player competitive mode, borrowing levels from the single player to add a much needed multi-player component. Tails could also follow Sonic around in single player mode, and could be controlled by plugging in a second Genesis gamepad.Sonic gets a sidekick.[CR]Arguably the most dramatic improvement is the implementation of the Spin-dash. By ducking and pressing the jump button, Sonic would rev up in ball form. After revving up enough, the player could stop pressing down to get a burst of speed while staying rolled into a ball. Beyond those two additions, however, gameplay for Sonic the Hedgehog 2 remains relatively the same; the goal is still to get to the end of a level as quickly as possible, while destroying as many enemies and collecting as many rings as possible. Rather than having three acts and a boss fight (as in Sonic 1), Sonic 2 features only two acts per level, with some exceptions (Metropolis Zone features three acts, Sky Chase, Wing Fortress, and Death Egg all feature a single act each).[CR]Chaos Emeralds also returned from the original, offering up an additional 7th Emerald (instead of the original game's 6). The special stages were done on a endless half-pipe which Sonic ran forward on collecting rings and avoiding enemies. If he had enough rings when he hit the checkpoint then he would continue until eventually obtaining a Chaos Emerald. Collect all 7 and Sonic would be able to transform into Super Sonic. In this form Sonic becomes even faster and rather than his usual blue is colored a bright yellow.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Not content just exploring his home of South Island, Sonic the Hedgehog's adventures took him all over the globe. It was eventually he found himself at West-side Island, said to be home to a lost civilization. This civilization were given seven "Chaos Emeralds" of great power as a gift from the Gods. Eventually, this power corrupted the civilization, and this angered the Gods greatly. As punishment, they sealed the emeralds away in an alternate dimension called "The Special Zone".Sonic apparently didn't read the in-flight safety booklet.[CR]Intrigued, Sonic lands his biplane, the Tornado, on the island. It's here Sonic runs in to a shy, two-tailed fox named Miles - Sonic nicknames him "Tails" for obvious reasons. Tails, as it turns out, loves machinery, and he is fascinated by Sonic's plane. Before the two can get too acquainted, however, they hear an explosion in the distance. Doctor Ivo 'Eggman' Robotnik has followed Sonic to this island, and is tearing it apart looking for the Chaos Emeralds. He hopes they will act as an energy source for his greatest, most deadly creation: a giant, weaponized space station called the "Death Egg." Together, Sonic and Tails agree that Robotnik has to be stopped at all costs.[CR]Special Stage[CR]The Special Stage is played from behind Sonic in a 3D half-pipe. The player is given a target of the number of rings they have to collect as Sonic runs through the pipe whist avoiding the bombs. If the target is met then the stage continues, if not then the player returns to the level where they entered the Special Stage with a total of no rings. By meeting all the targets in the Special Stage, the stage is cleared and the player unlocks a Chaos Emerald. Each new Special Stage is harder than the one which preceded it and they have to be completed in order with no way to skip to the next one without completing the one previous.Tony Hawk ain't got nothin' on Sonic.[CR]After collecting all 7 Chaos Emeralds, compared to the total of 6 found in the Master System version, Sonic gains the ability to change into Super Sonic after collecting 50 rings. When Sonic becomes his super form he is virtually invincible, running and jumping much higher than normal, only able to be killed by drowning, being crushed, falling off the screen or by running out of time in the level. This added speed comes at a price as it makes it almost impossible to do precise jumps due to the increased speed as well as loosing 1 ring a second whilst in super form; with Sonic reverting back to his normal self when the rings reach zero and effectively making him a sitting duck to enemies.[CR]Two Player Versus Mode[CR]Sonic 2 also included a two versus player mode where, playing as either Sonic or Tails, two players can have a split screen race on one of 3 different zones or a Special Stage. In the regular zone races, on either Emerald Hill Zone, Casino Night Zone or Mystic Cave Zone, players are ranked in 5 different areas with the highest score winning the round. On the Special Stage the winner is the one who collects the most rings. In the case of a tie in the regular zones a Special Stage is then ran to determine a winner. Two player mode also added a couple of new item boxes. One being a teleporter which switched the two players around, the other being a Dr. Robotnik item which damaged the player that found it.[CR]Compatibility with Sonic &amp; Knuckles[CR]Sonic 2 &amp; Knuckles![CR]By slotting the Sonic the Hedgehog 2 cart into the top of the Sonic &amp; Knuckles Lock-on featured cart the player could play as Knuckles in Sonic 2. The game is essentially exactly the same with the player playing as Knuckles instead of either Sonic or Tails. He can glide and climb walls but due to his inferior jumping ability some boss fights are more difficult as Knuckles. There are a few minor differences in the way Star Post checkpoints are handled however as when returning to a level after a Special Stage the player would keep the rings they had before they went in, whereas in the default game all rings were lost. The same applies when a life is lost.Re-releases[CR]The Genesis version of this game was re-released on:Sonic Compilation on the Mega Drive in EuropeSonic 3-in-1 on the Genesis in North AmericaSega Smash Pack 2 on the PCReal Arcade on the PCSonic Mega Collection on the Nintendo GamecubeSonic Mega Collection Plus on the PS2, Xbox and PCSonic Genesis Collection on the PS2 and PSPWii Virtual ConsoleXbox Live Arcade MarketplaceSonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PS3[CR]Numerous mobile phone versions also exist.[CR]Zones[CR]Sonic the Hedgehog 2 has 11 zones, plus one special stage. This is twice as many as the original Sonic, which had 6 zones. However, a big difference this time around is that most of the zones have two acts instead of three. This is not a hard and fast rule though, as the Metropolis Zone had 3 acts and both the Death Egg Zone and the Wing Fortress zones had only one.Emerald Hill ZoneThe Emerald Hill Zone[CR]This zone is similar to the Green Hill Zone of the previous Sonic game. It&#8217;s set in a tropical resort that features many trees, green hills and wildlife-themed enemies. Dr. Robotnik appears here in a vehicle with a giant mechanical drill attached to the front. He travels back and forth in an attempt to impale the player, and due to this simplistic process, he is therefore relatively easy to defeat.Chemical Plant ZoneThe Chemical Plant Zone[CR]This zone is set in a bustling industrial city that is flooded with a neon pink liquid, Sonic can survive while submerged in this, but only for a limited time since there are no air bubbles. Dr. Robotnik makes his appearance with a suction tube clipped onto the bottom of his ship, which he uses to extract toxic materials from the liquid below, which he will then attempt to drop on the player. The player must attempt to avoid these attacks while remaining on the platform, which features panels that will successively rotate.Aquatic Ruin ZoneThe Aquatic Ruin Zone[CR]This zone is set in the half-submerged, swampy remains of a crumbling ruin. Players who fall into the water will find that they have a harder time than those who were skillful enough to stay dry, as the underwater path is significantly harder than the land path. Robotnik appears here with a giant mallet attached to his ship, he will hit down on two columns that flank the player on either side of street, causing them to shoot out arrows. The player must use these arrows as platforms in order to be able to reach Robotnik and bring him down.Casino Night ZoneThe Casino Night Zone[CR]This zone is reminiscent of the Spring Yard Zone of Sonic 1, in that it is set up to be a giant casino themed pinball table. Of course, this means the player must try and get past obstacles such as bumpers and slot machines in their attempt to reach Dr. Robotnik. He appears here at the bottom of a pinball table, with a set of electric pincers on the bottom of his ship. He uses this to drop bombs on the player, so staying on the ground is inadvisable. Instead, the player must spin dash up to, and utilize, the bumpers in order to hurl themselves at Robotnik.Hill Top ZoneThe Hill Top Zone[CR]This zone is set just above the clouds, on top of a set of hills. Sonic must cross over the top of the hills, and then delve down into it to face pools of magma and earthquakes, which makes the floor rise from under him. Here, the doctor emerges from the lava in a heat proof submarine with a flamethrower attached on top. He will repeatedly emerge from the lava and attempt to shoot the player with flames, which also sets the ground on fire. The player must strike out at Robotnik once he emerges from the lava, while avoiding the jet stream of flames.Mystic Cave ZoneThe Mystic Cave Zone[CR]This underground zone is set in a deep cave, which is covered in crystals. Sonic must swing from vines and avoid being crushed by crystals while they progress on their way to Dr. Robotnik. If the player manages to get through this stage, they are greeted at the end by Robotnik, who has a pair of drills attached on either side of ship. He uses these to drill into the ceiling and create sharp debris that will fall on the player if they&#8217;re not careful.Oil Ocean ZoneThe Oil Ocean Zone[CR]This zone is a giant oil refinery which features pools of thick oil that that the player can skim across. The oil is a double-edged sword, however, as while players can use it, if they are not careful they can sink into it and lose a life. Robotnik appears here in a submarine similar to the one he uses in the Hill Top Zone, but instead of a flamethrower, he now has a laser cannon that is much more lethal. Another new tactic he uses is that when submerged, he will send out a claw that travels over one of the platforms on the screen.Metropolis ZoneThe Metropolis Zone[CR]This is the only stage in the game to contain three distinct acts. This massive, construction themed, zone features corkscrews, copious spikes, magma and, of course, industrial themed moving platforms. After players make the lengthy excursion to the end of act three, they will predictably find Dr. Robotnik there. This time, he is surrounded by seven shaped pods, which rotate around him, creating a protective shield. Every time the player hits Robotnik, one of the pods will break off and transform into an inflatable copy of him, but these don&#8217;t pose a problem as they can be destroyed with a single hit. After all the pods have been destroyed, Robotnik will strafe across the screen with a laser beam. He is vulnerable in this state, however, as one more hit will send him packing.Sky Chase ZoneThe Sky Chase Zone[CR]This one act zone is set in the sky, as Sonic rides on top of Tail&#8217;s plane, the Tornado. Throughout the stage, Sonic&#8217;s partner will remain under Sonic wherever he goes, so falling isn&#8217;t a problem here. The player comes up against a variety of aerial themed enemies, but when they get to the end they will find that there is no boss in this stage.Wing Fortress ZoneThe Wing Fortress Zone[CR]Tails' plane, the Tornado, takes a hit and begins to fall to the ground. Sonic bails out and lands on Robotnik&#8217;s Wing Fortress. This flying citadel has many different traps and enemies, but the biggest threat to the player is falling off the screen, as this can be done a little too easily. Here, Robotnik has built a contraption to do the fighting for him. He locks Sonic within an energy field, and along with Sonic there is a laser cannon which strafes to and fro across the top of the screen, attempting to periodically fry the player. Along with the cannon, there are three flying spike platforms that bounce off the walls. The player must use these as a platform in order to reach and damage the sensitive cannon, while avoid their spiked sides.Death Egg ZoneMecha Sonic's first appearance, in the last stage of Sonic 2[CR]After the fight in the Wing Fortress Zone, Sonic chases Dr. Robotnik into the Death Egg. This, ringless, zone consists of two separate bosses. The first is Mecha Sonic, this doppelganger has some of Sonic&#8217;s moves, as he jumps and spin dashes across the stage. The player must hit him in the head while he stands still in order to damage him.The Final Boss, Dr. Robotnik[CR]After a few hits, Mecha Sonic goes down, and Sonic progresses into the next room for his final confrontation with Dr. Robotnik. The giant robot he appears in lumbers slowly around the arena, but the lower half of said monstrosity is invulnerable. The only way the player can reach the breakable upper half is to wait for the right moment. After trudging around for a bit, Robotnik rockets off the top of the screen, causing a target to appear over Sonic. When the target begins flashing, the giant egg bot is about to come crashing down. Immediately after landing, the machine lurches forward presenting the only safe opportunity to attack. But the player has to be careful as every other fall, he'll fire off his spiked arms which are near impossible to avoid unless Sonic is out of reach. After twelve hits Robotnik will go down, and the ending of the game begins.Hidden Palace ZoneHidden Palace Zone[CR]By using a Game Genie, it is in fact possible to get into the Hidden Palace Zone in the retail version on Sonic the Hedgehog 2. The code to unlock it is ACLA-ATD4 and then going into level select and pressing A and Start together when highlighting the Death Egg Zone. The level is obviously unfinished and cannot be completed without creating the Egg Prison item in debug mode. Bits of the level design seen in the numerous Beta versions of the game are still there including the infamous 'Master Emerald' block. All level art seen in previous Betas have been deleted presumably to save cartridge space and most of the textures as a result are just a glitched mess. In the background however, art from the Oil Ocean Zone can be seen. In the 2013 iOS and Android release of the game, this level was finally added into the game.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Sonic the Hedgehog 2's soundtrack was composed by returning musician Masato Nakamura, bass guitarist for Japanese Pop-music band Dreams Come True. The song that plays after Sonic defeats the final boss (but before the credits roll) is in fact a karaoke version of a Dreams Come True song known as "Sweet Sweet Sweet" (or, as its known in America, "Sweet Dream"), from their triple-platinum album "The Swinging Star."[CR]Development History[CR]Sonic the Hedgehog 2 nearly did not happen. After completing Sonic the Hedgehog, Yuji Naka resigned from Sega of Japan. Sega of Japan paid its employees based purely on how long they had been employed at the company, and given that Yuji Naka was still relatively new, he was not being paid very much, despite having worked on one of the most prominent titles for the company. He was lured to America by Mark Cerny, who worked for the Sega Technical Institute (STI). STI was formed to help bridge the gap between the relatively new American game developers and the seasoned Japanese game developers. Yuji Naka and most of SonicTeam agreed to take part in this, and officially, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was started at STI, featuring a mixture of Japanese and American developers and designers.[CR]Like the original Sonic the Hedgehog, a Character Design contest was held, this time to give Sonic a sidekick. The winner was Yasushi Yamaguchi's "Miles Prower" design. However, most of the team agreed that the character should be renamed to "Tails". Yasushi fought hard to keep the name as "Miles", even going so far as to make sure in-game art assets all read "Miles" instead of "Tails". Eventually, the team decided on a compromise - though the character's full name would be "Miles Prower", most people would call him "Tails" as a nickname.[CR]Initially, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was planned for the Sega Genesis, Sega Game Gear (which was also ported to the Master System), and an enhanced port to the Sega CD. All versions of the game were slated to feature Time Travel in some capacity. As the projects went on, however, Sonic 2 for the Sega CD began to drift rather heavily from its Sega Genesis and Sega Game Gear counterparts. Eventually, Sonic 2 for the Sega CD was re-named altogether to become its own separate Sonic game, titled Sonic CD and Sonic 2 for the Sega Genesis dropped the Time Travel gimmick. Sonic 2 on the Game Gear existed as sort of a middle ground in between it all; it features remixes of music from the Japanese version of Sonic CD, and a plot where Tails gets kidnapped (instead of Sonic CD's Amy Rose). Unused footage for a Sonic CD video sequence gives a brief look at an Antlion Robot very similar to the first boss of Sonic 2 for the Game Gear.[CR]8-bit Master System/Game Gear Game[CR]Master System Box Shot[CR]A month before the release of the 16-bit Sonic the Hedgehog 2 for the Mega Drive/Genesis on October 29, 1992, an 8-bit game called Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was released for the Sega Master System on October 16, 1992. It was released exclusively for PAL territories, such as Europe and South America, regions where the Master System was popular. It was followed by a port to the Sega Game Gear handheld, in PAL regions on October 29, 1992, followed by a North American release in November 1992.[CR]Sega outsourced its development to Aspect, another Japanese company, which created a very different game from similar concepts.[CR]Being released before the 16-bit version for the Mega Drive/Genesis, the 8-bit editions of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 represented the debut of character Miles "Tails" Prower, who became a recurring character in the series.[CR]The Master System version was released for the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console on November 18, 2008 in Japan, in North America on December 8, 2008and in the PAL regions on December 26, 2008.Storyline[CR]Tails has been kidnapped by the evil Dr. Robotnik. In order to guarantee his safe return, Sonic must stop Dr. Robotnik, thwart his evil plans, rescue Tails and retrieve the 6 Chaos Emeralds.Synopsis[CR]South Island has been peaceful since Dr. Robotnik's defeat. Sonic, bored, decides to go on a journey in search of other adventures. Upon his return, he is shocked to find the island nearly abandoned. The only clue as to where all his friends might have disappeared to is a single note, written by his two-tailed fox buddy, Miles "Tails" Prower. In the note, Tails explains that he's been kidnapped by Dr. Robotnik and is being held in a place called Crystal Egg. The price for Tails' safe return are the 6 Chaos Emeralds, to be delivered to 6 new boss robots. Thus, Sonic goes on a quest to find the Chaos Emeralds and rescue Tails.Gameplay[CR]The gameplay of Sonic 2 on the Master System/Game Gear was very different to the Genesis version. However, it was greatly updated in comparison to the original Sonic game also released on the Master System.[CR]It featured the ability to collect back up rings that Sonic had dropped when he was hit by an enemy as well as being able to smash through some walls by running into them. The game also featured levels where Sonic was required to ride along in a mine cart or fly a hand-glider. There was also a large bubble in the underwater levels which would allow Sonic to float upwards till he hit the ceiling or an enemy as well as the ability for Sonic to run on water provided he had enough speed; a feature absent from the 16-bit Genesis version of Sonic 2 but later implemented in Sonic 3.[CR]There were 7 zones in the game in total, each made of 3 Acts, with a prize panel being spun at the end of Acts 1 and 2 in which Sonic could earn an extra life. a continue, plus 10 rings or nothing, depending on which picture it landed on. Act 3 is the zones end level boss where Sonic must usually defeat a variety of robotic animals in order to proceed to the next zone.[CR]If the player manages to collect 5 Chaos Emeralds as they progress through the game, when they Mecha Sonic and defeat him they will be given the 6th Emerald and go on to fight Dr. Robotnik in Act 3 of the next and final zone, the Crystal Egg Zone. Defeating Dr. Robotnik here will unlock the "Good Ending". Failure to collect all 5 Chaos Emeralds before the encounter with Mecha Sonic will result in the game ending after his destruction and the player receiving the "Bad Ending" in which it is assumed that Dr. Robotnik has killed Sonic's friend Tails.Development[CR]Sonic the Hedgehog 2 received preview coverage in the October 1992 issue of GamePro.[CR]The Game Gear's lower screen resolution results in the Game Gear version having a smaller visible screen area than the Master System edition, causing some fans to consider the Game Gear version the more challenging title. For example, when facing the boss of the Underground Zone, the reduced screen area either side of Sonic gives the player less time to react to hazards moving onto the screen. Other bosses were also affected: the Green Hills Zone battle takes place in a smaller, steeper arena; there is a 3rd chute which cannot be seen while fighting Robotnik in the final Crystal Egg stage. The music for the intro sequence is also different. The Game Gear version uses the Scrambled Egg Zone music for the scene showing Robotnik escaping with the captive Tails and the Master System intro music for the title. The boss music is also different between the two versions. The Master System version used a single theme for the endings while a new good ending theme was added for the Game Gear version.[CR]The Game Gear version also features dark blue (instead of green) water in the second Act of the Aqua Lake Zone, and omits the game's only "Speed Shoes" item box, which may be found only in the Master System version of this stage. In the Game Gear version in power-up's original location is a Ring item box instead, thus rendering the item unused in said port.Soundtrack[CR]The music for Green Hills Zone was later used as the theme song for the Japanese and European versions of Sonic the Hedgehog CD, where it is called "Sonic: You Can Do Anything". A remix of the tune is also used for Mecha Green Hill Zone in Sonic the Hedgehog Chaos.Re-releases[CR]The Sega Master System/Game Gear game was re-released on:Sonic Mega Collection (2002) (GameCube, PS2, Xbox, PC)Sonic Adventure DX (2003) (GameCube, PC)Sonic Gems Collection (2005) (GameCube, PS2)[CR]The game was later re-released on Nintendo's Virtual Console service, with the Master System version released for the Wii Virtual Console in December 2008 and the Game Gear version released for the Nintendo 3DS eShop in June 2013.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The design for The Death Egg in this game most likely came from a Japanese TV commercial for the original Sonic the Hedgehog, wherein Sonic pilots a space ship to destroy a massive space station similar to Star Wars' own Death Star, but modified to look like Dr. Eggman's face.Early beta versions of the game reveal that, at one point, even more levels were planned for Sonic 2, including Wood Zone, a stage set in leafy tree tops, and Dust Hill Zone, a western-themed stage full of cacti and desert-dwelling robots. Hidden Palace Zone, not to be confused with the Sonic &amp; Knuckles stage of the same name, also exists in the beta version, along side an unplayable entry for a "Genocide City Zone". The stage "Neo Green Hill Zone" also exists, though selecting it from a stage-select menu takes Sonic to Aquatic Ruin Zone, possibly suggesting it originally went by a different name earlier in development.Interviews with various Sonic 2 graphics and level designers reveal even more cut levels never seen publicly: A recolored version of Dust Hill Zone to transform the sand in to snow, a Rock Zone, and a level called Cyber City Zone, possibly another name for Genocide City Zone. Genocide/Cyber City was supposed to take place between Metropolis Zone and Sky Chase, but time ran out - what work was completed on Genocide/Cyber City became Metropolis Zone Act 3.Level layouts from the cut level Wood Zone match up with level layouts for Metropolis Zone, possibly hinting at Sonic 2's now lost time travel feature. This suggests that Wood Zone would have possibly been what Metropolis Zone looked like in the distant past.Many of the resources made for deleted Sonic 2 levels eventually made it in to Sonic Spinball, another Sega Technical Institute game. Tiles for Hidden Palace Zone can be seen in the background for Toxic Caves, and graphics for a level called "The Machine" match up with concept art drawn for Cyber City Zone.Furthering the lost connection between Sonic 2 and Sonic CD, artwork of Sonic CD's "Little Planet" showcases areas on the planet that represent all levels present in the game, save for the top-right corner of the planet: A desert region, covered in cactus, reminiscent of this game's Dust Hill Zone.By collecting all seven chaos emeralds and fifty rings in a level, Sonic can transform in to the invincible Super Sonic form. Super Sonic is a bright golden yellow color with up-turned spikes, an obvious reference to Dragon Ball Z's Super Saiyan form. Yuji Naka was reportedly a big fan of Dragon Ball, and during his stay in America, had VHS tapes the latest episodes shipped to him weekly from overseas.Foxes, in Japanese folklore, are mischievous mythological beings sometimes refered to as a "Kitsune" (pronounced "Kit-Sue-Ney"). As a Kitsune ages, it grows additional tails, up to a maximum of nine. Additional tails on a Kitsune represent the level of mystical energy and intelligence within the being. Some stories say that a Kitsune will only grow a new tail every 1,000 years. A Kitsune with 9 tails is said to have infinite wisdom, and usually has fur that appears golden in color.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]Plug a Controller Pad into Slot 2 and Hold [B]UpperLeft+1+2[/B] as you turn on the console.

Escape![CR]Sonic the Hedgehog: Spinball (known in Japan as Sonic Spinball) is a hybrid 2D platformer/pinball video game developed by Polygames and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis on November 23, 1993. Players control Sonic the Hedgehog as a pinball (also controlling the various flippers around the stages), as he ventures through each of the four stages while collecting Chaos Emeralds and defeating the boss machines of Dr. Robotnik.[CR]The game is one of the two games to make use of elements from both the Sonic the Hedgehog and Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon series (the other game being Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine). The story involves Sonic infiltrating Dr. Robotnik's diabolical lair (the Veg-O-Fortress) on Mt. Mobius (thwarting his latest plan to turn the animals of planet Mobius into robots). This time, he must make use of Dr. Robotnik's new Pinball Defense System to navigate the lair.[CR]The game was later ported to the Sega Game Gear (on September 1994) and Sega Master System (Europe only on January 1995) by SEGA IDD.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]There are four levels. In each level, the player has to collect all Chaos Emeralds to unlock the boss room. Defeating the boss clears the level. In between each level, players can enjoy bonus stages that consist of Sonic himself playing an actual pinball machine with three lives to complete a challenge, and which have slightly different physics from the main game. Each Bonus Stage plays at a specific time and do not have to be completed; even if the player loses at the Trapped Alive stage after completing the first level, they will still proceed to the Robo Smile stage after completing the second.Toxic CavesToxic Caves[CR]Boss: Scorpius[CR]Emeralds: 3[CR]After getting shot off Tails' plane in the intro movie, Sonic finds himself at the very bottom of the Veg-o-Fortress, a series of caves and sewers which have become polluted by toxic waste thanks to Robotnik's equipment. Most of the tables in this stage have safety mechanisms; the lowest one has a platform beneath the flippers from which Sonic can jump back up into the action (don't linger too long though, or you'll be eaten by a robotic sea monster!). Other tables feature a barrel floating in the river of lethal slime beneath the flippers, which Sonic can use as a makeshift boat. Once all Emeralds have been collected and the boss room opens, however, these barrels begin to move, pushing up the difficulty a notch. The boss of the level is the Robotnik-faced Scorpius, who leaks surprisingly un-harmful green goo from his tail, and is actually ridiculously easy to defeat.[CR]Bonus Stage: Trapped Alive[CR]In the first Bonus Stage, Sonic plays a machine containing seven miniature prison cages which hold representations of innocent animals and friends of Sonic. Sonic must hit each cage with a ball several times in order to break it and free the prisoner inside. However, a miniature Dr. Robotnik in his floating boss ship moves back and forth between the bumpers and the cages, attempting to block the balls and send them down the gutter. Once all the prisoners are free, hit Robotnik one more time with a ball to destroy his ship and win the stage. As in all Bonus Stages, you get three balls (lives) to complete the task, which does not reset when you lose a ball. In addition, Bonus Stages allow the player to "bump the machine" by pressing all bumper buttons at once, though this can Tilt the game, forcing them to lose their current ball. Notably, while the prisoners include Miles "Tails" Prower and assorted random animals, they also include Princess Sally Acorn, Bunnie Rabbot, and Rotor Walrus, characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog animated series; these cameos in Sonic Spinball are the only time characters from the show have appeared in an official game.Lava PowerhouseLava Powerhouse[CR]Boss: Robo-Boiler[CR]Emeralds: 3[CR]This stage is an energy plant where Robotnik transforms the heat from rivers of hot magma into power for the rest of the Veg-o-Fortress, so relatively common pits of lava are the greatest danger here. There are steam jets and pistons that Sonic can use safely, and several parts of the stage feature doors that the player needs to hit several times before they open, as well as helpfully-placed "shotguns" which fire Sonic directly into the doors. A pressure dial gauge ensures that the player does not advance before collecting all the emeralds. The boss is the Robo-Boiler, the artificial intelligence which oversees the Powerhouse. Its weak points are the cluster of Robotnik heads inside its main body, and while the Boiler itself is defenceless, it will summon an endless swarm of flying Clucks to get in the way and prevent Sonic from getting inside.[CR]Bonus Stage: Robo Smile[CR]In the second Bonus Stage, the grinning face of Dr. Robotnik moves back and forth on the table, and players must smash all four of his teeth by hitting them repeatedly with the ball. Players can also earn points for hitting the back of Robotnik's head, for getting the ball into his mouth by shooting it into a gap left behind by an already smashed tooth, and for hitting the targets lining the back of the table. Sonic earns a nice bonus every time he hits all three targets.The MachineThe Machine[CR]Boss: Veg-o-Machine[CR]Emeralds: 5[CR]Dr. Robotnik would never make a lair this big without including a roboticization machine for transforming innocent animals into mindlessly obedient Badniks, and the Veg-o-Fortress is no exception. In 'The Machine', Sonic must carefully make his way through the twists and turns of the incredibly elaborate, unusually enormous roboticization chamber, here called the Veg-o-Machine. But be careful, below the flippers is a set of grinding gears which poses the primary threat in this level. Teleporters abound, and the elevator sections really challenge the player's aim. At the centre of The Machine is an array of cages to bust. Freeing all animals is not required, but it does award the player a nice bonus. The boss of this level is the actual chamber where animals are roboticized; Sonic must get inside through the exit port in order to bust up the machine, but first he must destroy the tubes feeding captured animal prisoners into the chamber, because the constant flow of robots blocks the exit otherwise. Which is just fine, since he was going to do that anyway.[CR]Bonus Stage: The March[CR]The centre of the third Bonus Stage's table has an Egg Prison on it, the chamber found at the end of every level of Sonic the Hedgehogs 1 through 3 that frees imprisoned animals when a button on top is pressed. Since the ball in the Bonus Stage can't leave the ground, you're going to have to do this the hard way and smash all the side panels to destroy the Egg Prison. But robotic duplicates of Scratch (a character from The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog, another animated series) march endlessly in a circle around the Prison, and you'll need to destroy them first if you want to get to the cage.ShowdownShowdown[CR]Boss: Robotnik's Ship[CR]Emeralds: 5[CR]The Lava Powerhouse has been shut down, rendering the power level wildly unstable, and the Veg-o-Machine has been utterly destroyed, cutting off robotic reinforcements. Sonic's meddling has left the Veg-o-Fortress on the verge of collapse, but Robotnik still has a few Badniks up his sleeve as well as a backup plan, to flee in a rocketship into space. Sonic must pursue Robotnik through his space hangar and stop him from escaping. Despite this setting, there is no time limit, however this stage is by far the most merciless. A whole sequence of switches need to be triggered to activate the kickback for one of the deadly outlanes, and it is possible to fall out of the boss room with Robotnik's escape craft, requiring the player to fight their way back up before they can continue the battle.[CR]Secret Bonus Stage: Cluck's Defence[CR]Although the game ends when you complete the Showdown level, and there is no proper fourth Bonus Stage, a hidden Bonus Stage can be reached during any of the game's four levels: if Sonic collects every ring on a level, then circles of swirls will open up throughout the level (similar to the swirls leading to bonus stages that appear above Checkpoints in Sonic's platforming games). Jumping into the swirl here leads to a special Multiball Bonus Stage, where all three balls are in play at once. The actual objective is to destroy a crab robot in the back row by hitting him many times with the balls. However, two defensive Cluck robots move back and forth in front of him in the way Robotnik did in the Trapped Alive stage. Destroy the crab robot to win the stage, and you'll get a huge bonus to your score and be returned to the level you just left.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Various Cheats[CR]Select the Sound FX option, then play one of the following sequences of sounds.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Skipping[CR]Go to the options menu and choose "Sound Effects." Then play tracks 0, 2, 1, 5, 6, and 6 in that order. If done correctly, the screen will rattle. Exit the menu and start the game. Press Start, 1 and 2 simultaneously to skip to the boss section of that level.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1993</releasedate>				<year>1994</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>2.9</rating>				<videoid>1l1TXtKwsF8</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3015</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570234-sonic-the-hedgehog-spinball</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/sonic-the-hedgehog-spinball</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-spinball/3030-18592/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/7418</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3015-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3015-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/117970-sonic-the-hedgehog-spinball-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212661-sonic-the-hedgehog-spinball-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212666-sonic-the-hedgehog-spinball-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212667-sonic-the-hedgehog-spinball-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212662-sonic-the-hedgehog-spinball-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212664-sonic-the-hedgehog-spinball-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212663-sonic-the-hedgehog-spinball-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212665-sonic-the-hedgehog-spinball-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212668-sonic-the-hedgehog-spinball-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1283957-sonicspin_gen_004.png</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/17172/1283956-sonicspin_gen_006.png</snapshot10>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/7tRMubp.png</banner1>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/3015.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Sonic's Edusoft (Unknown) (Proto)">				<description>Sonic's Edusoft (Unknown) (Proto)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FSonic%27s%20Edusoft%20%28Unknown%29%20%28Proto%29.zip" size="123423" />				<title_clean>Sonic's Edusoft</title_clean>				<plot>Sonic's Edusoft is an unreleased educational game for the Sega Master System developed in 1991 by Tiertex.

It was developed by Sega AM2 and created by legendary developer, Yu Suzuki, responsible for many popular Sega games. The game was published by Sega and originally released in the arcades in October 1985. Since then, the game has been released on a number of platforms and spawned many sequels.Using Sega's Super Scaler 16-bit graphics technology, the game produced pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates, with the ability to scale as many as 32,000 sprites and fill a moving landscape with them, along with 6144 colors on screen out of a 98,304 color palette (15-bit RGB high color depth with shadow &amp; highlight).It also introduced a true analog flight stick for movement, with the ability to register movement in any direction as well as measure the degree of push, which could move the player character at different speeds depending on how far the stick is pushed in a certain direction. It also introduced a motion-based, hydraulic cockpit arcade cabinet, which moved in the direction the player moved the joystick. The game was also an early example of a third-person shooter; it was influenced by the earlier 1982 Sega game Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom, and Space Harrier in turn influenced later 3D shooters such as Nintendo's Star Fox (Starwing) in 1993.Running on the Sega Space Harrier arcade system board previously used by Hang-On, the pseudo-3D sprite/tile scaling in the game was handled in a similar manner to textures in later texture-mapped polygonal 3D games of the 1990s. Yu Suzuki stated that his "designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from Hang-On. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D."[1] The game's success established Suzuki as the leading arcade game designer at the time.[2]Space Harrier later saw ports to many home game systems.Space Harrier's release on the Sega Master System home console is particularly notable, as there were two versions: one was a port of the arcade game, while the other, entitled Space Harrier 3-D (1988), supported the SegaScope stereoscopic 3D glasses. The game also spawned the sequel Space Harrier II (1988) and the spin-off Planet Harriers (2000).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]"Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready!"The game takes place in a unique place called the "Fantasy Zone" (no deeper plot is associated with Space Harrier). The Fantasy zone is a place filled with many strange creatures like one-eyed mammoths, alien pods, strange looking dragons, robots and flying mushrooms etc. The main character is a man with a giant gun/rocket that allows him to fly around. He runs along in a pseudo 3D level blasting anything that comes at him.The game has the player moving forward at all times and many enemies will get in the player's way, blasting projectiles and moving along in a certain pattern. The player must also do his or her best to move out of harm's way while shooting at anything that's presented on screen. Most objects are destructible, but some are not. If the player gets hit once, he or she will lose a life. The player starts off with two lives, and an extra life can be gained if the player racks up 5,000,000 points.The arcade version.The points will gradually increase as the player keeps moving. More points will be given for every thing that is destroyed by the player.There are eighteen stages in the game and a boss fight is presented in the end of sixteen of the stages. Two of the stages, stage 5 and stage 12, are bonus levels. The main character will jump on a dragon-like creature and destroy as many objects - trees, stone poles and bushes - as he or she can.Stages:The third stage, Amar.Stage 1: MootStage 2: GeezaStage 3: AmarStage 4: CiecielStage 5: Bonus StageStage 6: OlisisStage 7: LucasiaStage 8: IdaStage 9: ReviStage 10: MiniaStage 11: ParmsStage 12: Bonus StageStage 13: DrailStage 14: AsuteStage 15: VicelStage 16: NaturaStage 17: NarkStage 18: AbsymbelThe bonus stage.[CR]Arcade cabinets[CR]There were several different arcade cabinets. The first two were the standard upright and sit-down cabinets, which introduced the use of an analog flight stick that, for the first time, detected movement in 360 directions as well as the degree of push. The first port to feature similar analog stick controls was the version that appeared in Shenmue for the Dreamcast in 1999.The third was a new type of deluxe cabinet: the "rolling" cabinet. The "rolling" type moved the entire cabinet in the direction the player moved the analog flight stick, left/right and forward/backward, simulating flight movement for the first time in an arcade cabinet. The first port to simulate the rolling type deluxe arcade cabinet was Space Harrier 3D, which utilized the Nintendo 3DS's gyroscope motion sensor, in 2012.[CR]Sega Space Harrier arcade hardware[CR]The arcade hardware used to run the game is widely known as the Sega Space Harrier system, or less commonly known as the Sega Hang-On system. It utilized two boards: the CPU (Central Processing Unit) mother board, and the Super Scaler graphics board which handled the game's complex sprite-scaling. The game displayed 128 sprites per frame, at 60 frames per second, scaling 7680 sprites per second. The graphics board itself is capable of scaling up to 32,000 sprites per second with more memory, as was the case with later Super Scaler titles.Technical specificationsCPU (Central Processing Unit) mother boardMain CPU processors: 2x Motorola MC 68000 (16/32-bit) @ 10 MHz each Performance: 3.5 MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)Additional CPU: Intel 8751 (8-bit) @ 8 MHzSound CPU: Zilog Z80 (8-bit) @ 4 MHz Performance: 580,000 IPS (Instructions Per Second)Stereo sound chips FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesis chip: Yamaha YM2203 @ 4 MHz Channels: 3 FM channels, 3 SSG (Software-controlled Sound Generator) channelsPCM (Pulse-Code Modulation) chip: SegaPCM @ 8 MHz Channels: 16 PCM 8-bit channels @ 31.25 KHz sampling rateRAM (Random Access Memory) Program RAM: 32 KBAudio RAM: 2 KBROM (Read-Only Memory) Program EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM) memory: 448 KBAudio EPROM: 192 KBAudio ROM for PCM audio samples: Up to 16 MBSuper Scaler GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) boardGPU: Sega Super Scaler 171-5320 graphics card Sega 315-5011 sprite line comparitorSega 315-5012 sprite generator2x Sega 315-5049 tilemap chipsSega PAL chipset: 2x Sega 315-5107 horizontal timing controlSega 315-5108 vertical timing controlSega 315-5122 timing chipDisplay resolution: 320 x 224 pixelsColours on screen: 6,144Colour palette: 32,768 (15-bit colour)Frame rate: 60 frames per secondSprites displayed per frame: 128Sprites displayed per second: 7680Sprites scaled per second: Up to 32,000Hardware layers: 2 tile layers1 text layer1 sprite layer with hardware sprite zooming1 road layerTranslucent shadowsVRAM (Video RAM) memory: 192 KB high-speed SRAM (Static RAM)Graphics EPROM: 1152 KB[CR]Console ports[CR]The game was ported to several Sega consoles, such as the Sega 32X, and Sega Saturn. It also found its way to numerous computers and consoles of its era, often with various compromises in quality. The 32X version is one of the earliest ports to match quality with the arcade game, though even it cuts a couple of corners here and there. The Saturn version, released in Japan as "Sega Ages: Space Harrier" is also a pretty faithful version of the game. This version of the game also appeared in the US with two other games on a compilation disc simply called Sega Ages.The two Master System versions, including Space Harrier 3-D, reduced the graphical quality and speed quite a bit, but still managed to be a recognizable port of the original game. The first Master System version, released in 1986, was the first home video game cartridge to feature 2 Megabits (256 Kilobytes) of memory. The second Master System version, Space Harrier 3-D, featured the use of stereoscopic 3D graphics. The Master System versions also contain a new final boss fight against two glowing dragon creatures known as "Haya Oh." This new boss fight also appears in the X68000 version of the game. The Game Gear version of the game shares some of the basic quality issues as the Master System release, but contains different levels, an adjusted resolution, and a password system for continuing from later levels.Space Harrier, featured in Shenmue.The game was also featured in the game Shenmue. Space Harrier was located in the "You Arcade" building in the Dobuita area of the game; the player has to pay one-hundred yen to play the game. The "Sega Saturn" version of Space Harrier was also featured as a prize in the raffle in some of the convenience stores. The Sega Saturn version can be played on Ryo's Sega Saturn that is located in his living room.A polygonal remake of the game was made as part of Sega's Sega Ages series in Japan. The polygonal version of Space Harrier was released outside of Japan in the form of Sega Classics Collection.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Arcade versionThe arcade game was well received upon release. It became one of 1986's chart hits in the arcades. Computer and Video Games magazine reviewed the arcade game in its March 1986 issue, after reviewer Clare Edgeley played it at the 1986 ATEI (Amusement Trades Exhibition International) show in London, along with the arcade version of Super Mario Bros. She stated, "Perhaps the games to steal the show were" Space Harrier along with Shrike Avenger (1986), praising their hydraulic cockpit cabinets that "twist, turn and move" in the same direction as the joystick, making them "the most realistic" simulators "to date". She praised Space Harrier's "excellent graphics" for being "all in 3D with amazing technicolour landscapes" and a "multitude of objects" on screen, as well as "the sounds of the battle" output by "large speakers" where "you could almost lose touch with reality". She also praised the gameplay for being "exciting" and "very fast" paced, as well as the continue feature, but stated the game can be "very difficult."Clare Edgeley gave the arcade game a retrospective review in the February 1987 issue of Sinclair User, where she noted it had one of the first hydraulic arcade cabinets she had seen, along with 1986's Shrike Avenger. She stated that Space Harrier's "fabulously colourful 3D graphics" and "the movement of the sit-in cabinet were, and still are, breathtaking", noting "the seat-belt" and "turbulent" ride which "hurls you up, down, left and right" and tilts "the cabinet in a roll in whatever direction you push your joystick", concluding the game to be "great fun."Home conversionsReview scoresPublicationScoreComputer and Video Games70% (C64)68% (ZX)40% (CPC)[3]CRASH77% (ZX)Famitsu34/40 (3DS)Sinclair User (ZX)Your Sinclair9/10 (ZX)The Milwaukee Journal9/10 (SMS)AwardsEntityAwardGolden Joystick AwardsGame of the Year (Runner&#8209;Up)The home conversions were also well received.

It was developed by Sega AM2 and created by legendary developer, Yu Suzuki, responsible for many popular Sega games. The game was published by Sega and originally released in the arcades in October 1985. Since then, the game has been released on a number of platforms and spawned many sequels.Using Sega's Super Scaler 16-bit graphics technology, the game produced pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates, with the ability to scale as many as 32,000 sprites and fill a moving landscape with them, along with 6144 colors on screen out of a 98,304 color palette (15-bit RGB high color depth with shadow &amp; highlight).It also introduced a true analog flight stick for movement, with the ability to register movement in any direction as well as measure the degree of push, which could move the player character at different speeds depending on how far the stick is pushed in a certain direction. It also introduced a motion-based, hydraulic cockpit arcade cabinet, which moved in the direction the player moved the joystick. The game was also an early example of a third-person shooter; it was influenced by the earlier 1982 Sega game Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom, and Space Harrier in turn influenced later 3D shooters such as Nintendo's Star Fox (Starwing) in 1993.Running on the Sega Space Harrier arcade system board previously used by Hang-On, the pseudo-3D sprite/tile scaling in the game was handled in a similar manner to textures in later texture-mapped polygonal 3D games of the 1990s. Yu Suzuki stated that his "designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from Hang-On. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D.

It takes place somewhere in the 21st century and you control a team of five ballers who are wearing spiked armor bodywear, helmets and gloves. The 160 feet long and 90 feet wide play area, called the Speed Dome, is a arena surrounded by a 30 feet high steel-wall with a goal at either end. The aim is to get the steel-ball into the opponent's goal and there are no rules to accomplish this aim. So one can beat up the opponent players and the opponent goalkeeper as well to make it just that little easier to get to the goal and score. The mechanical ball launcher in the center of the play area spits out the ball in a random direction at the start of play and after a team scored a goal. There are two door-sized holes, called ball warp tunnels, positioned on opposing walls in the center of the arena. Throwing the ball into one of them causes it to reappear on the opposite side at exactly the same speed and angle as it entered. The four bounce domes appear in different formats on the play area for each match. The players can move freely over the bounce domes whereas the ball will be deflected off of the bounce domes.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>				<year>1990</year>				<genre>Action, Sports</genre>				<studio>Image Works</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>				<rating>3.0</rating>				<videoid>CQ5Pycd1A2c</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3023</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588146-speedball</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/speedball</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/speedball/3030-13768/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3023-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/40201-speedball-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/40202-speedball-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/155420-speedball-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141665-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-old-release-splash.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141670-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-new-release-splash.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141671-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141666-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-setting-up-a-game.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141667-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-choosing-your-team.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141668-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-knockout-round.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141673-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-here-comes-the-ball.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141674-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-red-players-advance.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141675-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-to-the-green-goal.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141677-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-goaly-passes.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Speedball (Europe) (Image Works)">				<description>Speedball (Europe) (Image Works)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FSpeedball%20%28Europe%29%20%28Image%20Works%29.zip" size="63430" />				<title_clean>Speedball</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Speed Dome.[CR]Speedball is a violent futuristic sports game that combines elements of handball, wrestling and football/rugby.

The mechanical ball launcher in the center of the play area spits out the ball in a random direction at the start of play and after a team scored a goal. There are two door-sized holes, called ball warp tunnels, positioned on opposing walls in the center of the arena. Throwing the ball into one of them causes it to reappear on the opposite side at exactly the same speed and angle as it entered. The four bounce domes appear in different formats on the play area for each match. The players can move freely over the bounce domes whereas the ball will be deflected off of the bounce domes.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1990</releasedate>				<year>1990</year>				<genre>Action, Sports</genre>				<studio>Image Works</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>				<rating>3.0</rating>				<videoid>CQ5Pycd1A2c</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3023</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588146-speedball</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/speedball</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/speedball/3030-13768/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/7/73970/1306210-speedball.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/40201-speedball-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/40202-speedball-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/155420-speedball-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141665-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-old-release-splash.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141670-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-new-release-splash.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141671-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141666-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-setting-up-a-game.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141667-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-choosing-your-team.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141668-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-knockout-round.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141673-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-here-comes-the-ball.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141674-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-red-players-advance.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141675-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-to-the-green-goal.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141677-speedball-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-goaly-passes.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Speedball 2 (Europe)">				<description>Speedball 2 (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FSpeedball%202%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="147600" />				<title_clean>Speedball 2</title_clean>				<plot>Brutal Deluxe doesn't live up to their name - in fact they're the worst team Speedball has ever seen. As their manager, it is your job to transform their fortunes. As well as the league system, which consists of 2 8-team divisions and challenges you to advance to the top, there are also 2 cup tournaments, one of which is played out over 2 'legs' with the aggregate score deciding who progresses.[CR]You can play the matches as well, which is the real meat of the game. They consist of 2 90-second periods, and the gameplay is futuristic, fast and frantic, with heavy tackling encouraged to retrieve the ball. Power-ups and tokens appear on the pitch, including ones to make your players extra-tough or freeze the opponents.[CR]The sides of the pitch each include a score multiplier, which you can run the ball through to increase the value of your scoring - the opposition can sometimes immediately grab the ball and nullify this. There are also 5 stars which are worth 2 points each if you hit them (more if you have the multiplier activated), but these can also be cancelled out by the opposition hitting the same star, and their points values only become set after the half. Next to the stars there are 'portals' which throw the ball out the opposite side of the pitch, in the direction it was going.[CR]You get money for the results, and by collecting the silver tokens which appear on the pitch at random intervals. Between each match you can spend these either on improving your existing players as far as they can go, or on buying better ones and fitting them into the team. Your original players can only be improved to a certain extent, so remembering where your signed players are and making use of them is important.[CR]A variety of tokens also appear during the match, some of which boost your team's power for a short period of time, and one freezes the opposition.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/speedball-2-brutal-deluxe[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1992</releasedate>				<genre>Sports</genre>				<studio>Virgin Interactive</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Alt</nplayers>				<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>				<rating>8.0</rating>				<videoid>glkaHAZVhXc</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3024</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/566292-speedball-2</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/speedball-2-brutal-deluxe</mobygames_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3024-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3024-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164381-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141646-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-sega-master-system-screenshot-splash.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141647-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141648-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-sega-master-system-screenshot-the.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141650-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-sega-master-system-screenshot-setting.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141651-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-sega-master-system-screenshot-let.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141652-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-sega-master-system-screenshot-next.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141653-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-sega-master-system-screenshot-setting.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141654-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-sega-master-system-screenshot-the.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141660-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-sega-master-system-screenshot-the.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/141661-speedball-2-brutal-deluxe-sega-master-system-screenshot-hot.jpg</snapshot10>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/3024.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="SpellCaster (USA, Europe)">				<description>SpellCaster (USA, Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FSpellCaster%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" size="299647" />				<title_clean>SpellCaster</title_clean>				<plot>Kujakuo is based on the comic by the same name, published in Young Jump in the late eighties and drawn by Makoto Ogino. It is a tale of the occult, centred around the buddhist monk Kujaku.[CR]In this game, Kujaku is sent out by his master, Ajari, to find out what has happened at the nearby temple of Hieizan. Upon arriving, after having fought his way through magical creatures and deadly warriors, he find his comrades slain. One of them, Kubira, is still holding on to his life, and before drawing his last breath, he utters the word "Izumo". Ajuri then sends Kujaku to the town of Izumo, where he encounters a deadly enemy of unknown origin.[CR]Kujakuo is part adventure game  la Dj vu (or, since this is a Sega game, Hoshi o sagashite), part platform action. To get between the adventure parts, you must pass an action level, as well as a boss fight or two, just as in Cosmic Spacehead.[CR]The adventure part has you looking at a scenery, with a text box for descriptions and lines, and a set of verbs on the right. Use a cursor to point out specific objects for your verbs.[CR]In the platform levels, Kujaku can jump and shoot magic bolts. While the usual bolt is small, he can load up before releasing them, R-Type style. Pressing the pause button opens up the spell menu, for accessing more powerful magical spells. New spells can be learned throughout the game. Most spells are offensive, but some grant additional powers such as levitation. Each time a spell is activated, you use up your limited spirit energy. Enemies will, when killed, sometimes drop spheres that will raise your spirit energy, though.[CR]This game was remade into Spellcaster upon its release in the West.</plot>				<releasedate>23/9/1988</releasedate>				<year>1989</year>				<genre>Action, Adventure</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.</studio>				<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>				<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>				<videoid>SdosYk8L6KQ</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3025</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588147-spellcaster</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/spellcaster_</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/spellcaster/3030-10557/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8912</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3025-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3025-1.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7395/1470087-engrish.png</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/2508/572793-logo.gif</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/6/a/8/gfs_86225_1_1.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/c/7/8/gfs_86225_1_2.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/c/8/gfs_86225_1_3.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/9/d/8/gfs_86225_1_4.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/0/6/8/gfs_86225_1_5.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/5/5/gfs_86225_2_3.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/3/4/5/gfs_86225_2_4.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/a/f/5/gfs_86225_2_5.jpg</snapshot10>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/jGaDrSn.jpg</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Spider-Man - Return of the Sinister Six (Europe)">				<description>Spider-Man - Return of the Sinister Six (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FSpider-Man%20-%20Return%20of%20the%20Sinister%20Six%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="152840" />				<title_clean>Spider-Man - Return of the Sinister Six</title_clean>				<plot>From the ingame intro:[CR]"Doctor Octopus is plotting the crowning caper of his criminal career... to rule the world.[CR]He has reunited the Sinister Six and with these super-villains together again, nothing stands in their way - except Spider-Man!"[CR]Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six is a side-scrolling game which puts you in the role of Spidey throughout six levels against Electro, Sandman, Mysterio, Vulture, Hobgoblin and Doctor Octopus respectively.

The opening of the game features an animated cinematic of the opening scene of the film. After that the player takes control of  Luke Skywalker, driving the  landspeeder across  Tatooine in search of  R2-D2.   Luke Skywalker explores various locations throughout Tatooine, fighting numerous enemies including Jawas and Stormtroopers. The game features many locations from the movie including the Chalmun's Cantina in Mos Eisley where Luke meets Han Solo for the first time. This section of the game features a classic 8-bit rendition of the "Cantina Band" theme as played by the fictitious band, Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes, in the feature film. The game also contains many famous lines from the movie including Obi-Wan Kenobi's plea to Luke to join him in his trip to Alderann and Han Solo's description of the smell from the Death Star's trash compactor.   The player eventually lands on the  Death Star and has to destroy the tractor beam to escape. The game also features first person segments of piloting the  Millenium Falcon through that Asteroid field that was once  Alderaan, and shooting down  Tie Fighters in both the Millenium Falcon and an  X-Wing fighter. The finale of the game features a top down view of Luke Skywalker's X-Wing flying through the Death Star trenches. After the player successfully fires a torpedo into the Death Star's exposed exhaust port, a cinematic of the Death Star exploding and Luke Skywalker being awarded a medal on Yavin IV is shown. The game featured the characters Luke Skywalker,  Han Solo,  Obi-Wan Kenobi,  Princess Leia, R2-D2, and C-3PO. The game however does not feature  Darth Vader or  Chewbacca, both of whom are major characters in the film.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Stage Select[CR]At the Title Screen press Right, Up, Down, Right, Up, Down, Right, Up, Down, Right, Right, Right on the title screen.

From left-to-right: Adam Hunter, Axel Stone, Blaze Fielding[CR]Streets of Rage (known in Japan as Bare Knuckle: Furious Iron Fist) is a 2D side-scrolling brawler developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis on July 17, 1991.[CR]The first in a trilogy of the same name, Streets of Rage chronicles the hunt for a powerful criminal organization (led by the secretive Mr. X) through the criminal-infested streets by a group of ex-cops (accomplished boxer Adam Hunter, skilled martial artist Axel Stone, and judo expert Blaze Fielding).[CR]The game was ported to Sega Game Gear and Sega Master System (Europe only) between 1992 and 1993. Unlike most ports to the systems, both use different graphic and gameplay engines. Both, however, omit Adam as a playable character. The original game was also ported to the arcade using Sega's Mega Tech and Mega Play arcade boards (both based on the Genesis hardware) in Europe, Australia, and Asia. The only difference between them is that the Mega Tech charges players for play time and the Mega Play charges for continues (like a traditional arcade game).[CR]Streets of Rage was re-released for various platforms over the years:[CR]Released for the Sega CD under two compilations (the Sega Classics Arcade Collection) in 1992 and 1994.[CR]Re-released for the Genesis under the Sega Genesis 6-PAK compilation.[CR]Included in the Japanese version of Sonic Gems Collection (for the GameCube and PlayStation 2) in 2005.[CR]Included in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection (for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3) on February 10, 2009.[CR]Released for Wii via the Wii Virtual Console on February 19, 2007.[CR]Released for the iOS platform in 2009.[CR]Released for the PC via Steam on January 26, 2011 (both individually and in the SEGA Genesis Classics Pack 4 and SEGA Genesis Classics Collection bundles).[CR]Included in Sega Vintage Collection: Streets of Rage for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade) on May 30, 2012.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Streets of Rage plays like a traditional side-scrolling brawler. Up to two players can choose between one of each of the game's main protagonists as they face eight levels of constant enemies:[CR]Adam Hunter (an accomplished boxer who sacrifices movement speed for both attacking power and jumping distance)[CR]Axel Stone (a skilled martial artist who sacrifices jumping distance for both attacking power and movement speed)[CR]Blaze Fielding (a judo expert who sacrifices attacking power for both jumping distance and movement speed).[CR]The main objective is to clear groups of enemies within a certain amount of time (which resets after groups of enemies are finished) and move forward to the next area. At the end of each level, the music changes and players fight an end boss. Once the player defeats the boss, the level ends (giving player an end bonus while refilling their health and Special Attack amount).[CR]Players earn score by defeating enemies and picking up money items. They also earn a bonus at the end of the level, composed of a clear bonus (of 20,000 points), time bonus (100 points for each second remaining), and level bonus (10,000 points for each difficulty above Easy). At the end of the game, they also earn 1,000 points for each life remaining (multiplied by the difficulty).[CR]Each player starts with three lives, and can get extra lives by either reaching certain score thresholds or picking up rare 1UP items. When the player's health meter is fully depleted (or the timer is fully depleted), he/she loses a life. If he/she has any lives remaining, he/she respawns from the top of the screen, knocking down all enemies on the field. If all lives are lost, then the player can input a name for the high scores list (if they have a valid score) and is given the option of using up a continue (giving the player three lives and removing all of his/her score). Each player starts with three continues, and if the player has no continues or lives remaining, then he/she gets a game over.Basic Controls and Attacks[CR]Players move around the screen using the D-Pad and jump around using the Jump Button (defaulted to the C Button). Pressing the basic Attack Button (defaulted to the B button) causes the player character to punch enemies, while pressing it repeatedly produces a combo of damaging punches and kicks. Pressing the Attack Button while jumping causes the player character to perform a jump kick, knocking down enemies in his/her path.[CR]Pressing both Jump and Attack buttons simultaneously causes the player character to perform a Rear Attack, which knocks back enemies behind him/her.Special Attacks[CR]When the player has at least one Special Attacks available (shown by the health meter as the S symbol), they can press the Special Attack Button (defaulted to the A button) at an opportune time to stop the fight as the screen quickly scrolls left to show a police car arriving at the scene. The passenger officer then helps the protagonists by firing either a Napalm Missile (if player 1 activates the attack) or Rocket-Propelled Grenades (if player 2 activates the attack).[CR]Both attacks are the same, however, as they deal heavy damage to all enemies on the screen (while knocking them down). Each player starts with one Special Attack, which can only be replenished by completing a level or respawning. They can, however, earn extra Special Attacks by finding a special item (a toy police car) at two points of the game. In the final stage (Round 8), Special Attacks are completely disabled.Grab Attacks[CR]By approaching enemies close enough (and not getting attacked), players automatically grab enemies from either the front or the back. After a short amount of time, they automatically release the enemy. By pressing the Jump button, they perform a shoulder vault, alternating between Front Grab and Back Grab positions.[CR]In the Front Grab position, players can tap the Attack button to perform a fury combo and use the Attack button while holding the opposite direction on the d-pad to throw the enemy behind him/her. In the Back Grab position, players can use the Attack button to perform a powerful Backdrop suplex.[CR]Players can also work together by grabbing each other and performing special team attacks. By holding the opposite direction on the d-pad and pressing the Attack button, the grabbing player throws his/her partner, who performs a flying kick. By pressing the Jump button, the grabbing player flips over his/her partner, performing a flying kick.[CR]Weapons and Bonus Items[CR]WeaponsAdam attacking with a Baseball Bat.[CR]Throughout the game, players can find weapons either dropped by enemies or by destroying certain objects (such as barrels, crates, and traffic cones). Players can equip a weapon by standing over it and pressing the Attack button. However, they can only pick up one weapon at a time, and picking up another weapon causes the player to drop the other weapon. The player also drops the weapon when he is knocked down. Dropped weapons disappear over time.Bottle - Powerful close-range attack.Knife - Powerful close-range attack, which can also be thrown at far enemies.Lead Pipe - Slow to attack, but powerful with a long range.Baseball Bat - Slow to attack, but powerful with a long range.Pepper Shaker - A throwable weapon that creates a puff of pepper smoke, stunning enemies into a sneezing fit.Bonus Items[CR]Alongside the five weapons, there are six items located throughout the game which give the player health (or other goodies) or adds to the player's score. They are found by destroying objects (the same type of objects used to hold weapons) and are picked up using the Attack button. (Unlike picking up weapons, picking up items does not drop the player's current weapon)Apple - Common item that restores about a quarter of the player's health bar.Beef - Uncommon item that restores the player's entire health bar. Usually found at the end of the level.Cash Bag - Common item that adds 1,000 points to the player's score.Gold Bars - Rare item that adds 5,000 points to the player's score.1UP - Rare item (little doll versions of the player characters) that gives the player an extra life.Special - Rare item (little toy police car) that grants the player an extra Special Attack.[CR]Enemies and Bosses[CR]Standard Enemies[CR]Throughout the protagonists' quest, they will be constantly assaulted by groups of punks. In order to progress to the next screen, they must clear out all enemies on the field. There are five types of punks to fight and, unlike the game's sequels, no names are shown for enemies on the game screen.[CR]Garcia - The standard type of punks (in either blue, green, or red denim clothing), who primarily attacks with punches and kicks (and sometimes equipped weapons). He can also grab players from the back (allowing enemies in front of you to attack you easier), in which players can perform a two-part attack (using the Attack button twice) in which the player kicks enemies in front of him/her and counter-throw the grabbing punk. Some of the Garcia punks also run around with a knife, charging at players relentlessly.[CR]Y. Signal - Usually shown from the back (in either yellow, purple, or green clothing). He grab players from the front and throws them foward. Some of the Y. Signal punks can also perform a sliding kick, which is difficult to dodge.[CR]Nora - Shown as a female dominatrix (in either red, black, or white clothing), who attacks with a long-ranged whip. Some of the Nora punks lay on the ground when players knock her down, making them temporarily invulnerable.[CR]Haku-Oh - A trained warrior shown in gray, red, or black kung fu gear, Haku-Oh jumps around and performs long-ranged jumping kicks at players.[CR]Jack - An uncommon enemy with spiked clown hair (and red, gray, or black clothing), Jack hops around juggling either axes or torches (which damage players that get too close). After some time, they throw the axes/torches ahead of them (causing damage to players in the way) and obtain more axes/torches.Bosses[CR]At the end of each level (with the exception of Round 7), players must fight one boss to continue to the next level. In some occasions (especially if two players are playing at the same time), players fight two of the same boss at the same time. At later levels, some bosses re-appear as mid-bosses. In Round 8, players must face all six bosses consecutively (without the ease of Special Attacks). Unlike the game's sequels, no names are shown for enemies on the game screen.[CR]Antonio - A large punk (wearing denim clothing) holding a large boomerang. Along with kicking players in front of him, he throws his boomerang around (which returns to him after being thrown). He is the main boss of Round 1.[CR]Souther - Wearing a red-sleeved jacket and claw-mounted gloves, he attacks with unavoidable and powerful slash attacks. He is the main boss of Round 2.[CR]Abadede - A former pro-wrestler, he primarily attacks with powerful charging punches. He can also perform a body slam if players are close enough. He is the main boss of Round 3.[CR]Bongo - A fat man in suspenders who charges players while breathing fire from his mouth. Attempting to perform a Backdrop attack on Bongo causes him to fall on the player, causing damage to that player. He is the main boss of Round 4.[CR]Mona &amp; Lisa - Japanese twins (with an appearance identical to Blaze) who fight together, performing jump kicks, forward throws, and Backdrop attacks. They are the main bosses of Round 5.[CR]Mr. X - The final boss of the game. Armed with a machine gun, he alternates between firing the gun (spreading bullets around the screen) and performing a powerful charging rifle butt.[CR][B]Endings:[/B][CR]Streets of Rage is the first brawler to feature multiple endings, which is determined by both players' choices at the end of the game. Before the fight boss fight, Mr. X asks the players if they want to be his right-hand man. This has one of three choices:[CR]If all players say "Yes", then Mr. X tests them by sending them down a trapdoor, resetting the game back to Round 6.[CR]If all players say "No", then they fight Mr. X and get the Good Ending, in which they celebrate after bringing justice.[CR]If one player says "Yes" and the other says "No", then both players fight in a duel. Once a player loses all his/her lives, Mr. X then asks the victor if he/she wants to join his organization. If the player says "Yes", then Mr. X tests him/her by sending him/her down a trapdoor, resetting the game back to Round 6. If the player says "No", then the player fights Mr. X and gets the Bad Ending, in which the player takes over the corrupt organization.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Stage Select[CR]At the Player Select screen, press Right 20 times.

Together with Adam's kid brother, Eddie "Skate" Hunter (Sammy Hunter in the Japanese version), and a friend of Axel's, professional wrestler Max Thunder (Max Hatchett in the European version), Axel and Blaze hunts down the syndicate once more.[CR]Streets of Rage 2 features a redesigned game engine from the original, showing larger characters and more use of the game screen (including a life bar system resembling the system from Final Fight) while adding new gameplay mechanics (such as the new Special Attack system and character-based abilities). These features were carried over to Streets of Rage 3.[CR]Upon release, the game received critical acclaim and is considered by many to be one of the best games ever made. In 2004, readers of Retro Gamer voted Streets of Rage 2 as the 64th top retro game.[CR]The game was ported to Sega Game Gear and Sega Master System (Europe only) in 1993. Along with different levels and inferior graphics, sounds, and gameplay, both omit Max as a playable character. The original game was also ported to the arcade using Sega's Mega Play arcade board (based on the Mega Drive/Genesis hardware) in Europe, Australia, and Asia.[CR]Streets of Rage 2 was re-released for various platforms after nearly ten years of its original release:Included in Sega Smash Pack: Volume 1 (for the Dreamcast) on April 6, 2001.Included in the Japanese version of Sonic Gems Collection (for the GameCube and PlayStation 2) in 2005.Released for the Wii (via the Wii Virtual Console) on February 19, 2007.Released for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade) on August 29, 2007.Included in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection (for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3) on February 10, 2009.Released for the PC (via Steam) on January 26, 2011 (both individually and in the SEGA Genesis Classics Pack 4 and SEGA Genesis Classics Collection bundles).Released for the iOS platform in April 14, 2011.Released for the PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network) on June 28, 2011.Included in Sega Vintage Collection: Streets of Rage for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade) on May 30, 2012.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Streets of Rage plays like a traditional side-scrolling brawler. Up to two players can choose between one of each of the game's main protagonists as they face eight levels of constant enemies:Players can choose the fighters that best suit their playing styles[CR]Axel Stone - Skilled martial artist. Sacrifices jump height for fighting technique.[CR]Blaze Fielding - Judo expert. All-around stats.[CR]Max Thunder - Professional wrestler. Sacrifices movement speed and jump height for power and stamina. Instead of shoulder vaults, he jumps with his grabbed opponent, which he then can use the Attack button to perform a Jumping Throw (if grabbing from the font) or an Atomic Drop (if grabbing from the back).[CR]Eddie "Skate" Hunter - Rollerblading kid. Sacrifices power and stamina for movement speed and jump height. By double-tapping either left or right on the d-pad, Skate can use his rollerblades to move faster. He can also throw enemies while performing shoulder vaults (by pressing the Attack button).[CR]The main objective is to clear groups of enemies within a certain amount of time (which resets after groups of enemies are finished) and move forward to the next area. At the end of each level, the music changes and players fight an end boss. Once the player defeats the boss, the level ends (giving player an end bonus while refilling their health).[CR]Players earn score by defeating enemies and picking up money items. They also earn a bonus at the end of the level, composed of a clear bonus (5,000 points multiplied by the level number), time bonus (1,000 points for each second remaining), and level bonus (5,000 points for Easy, 10,000 points for each difficulty above Easy).[CR]Each player starts with three lives (which can be changed in the Options menu), and can get extra lives by either reaching certain score thresholds (at 20,000 points, 50,000 points, 100,000 points, and every 100,000 points after that) or picking up rare 1UP items. When the player's health meter is fully depleted (or the timer is fully depleted), he/she loses a life. If he/she has any lives remaining, he/she respawns from the top of the screen, knocking down all enemies on the field. If all lives are lost, then the player can input a name for the high scores list (if they have a valid score) and is given the option of using up a continue (giving the player the base number of lives and removing all of his/her score). Each player starts with three continues, and if the player has no continues or lives remaining, then he/she gets a game over.Basic Controls and Attacks[CR]Players move around the screen using the D-Pad and jump around using the Jump Button (defaulted to the C Button). Pressing the Attack Button (defaulted to the B button) causes the player character to punch enemies, while pressing it repeatedly produces a combo of damaging punches and kicks (known as a Fury Attack), ending with a hit that knocks down enemies. Pressing both Jump and Attack buttons simultaneously causes the player character to perform a Rear Attack, which knocks back enemies behind him/her.[CR]Pressing the Attack button while jumping causes the player character to perform one of three types of jumping attacks: a stationary Jump Attack (by jumping straight up), a Jump Kick (by jumping left or right), and a Drop Attack (by jumping left or right and holding the down direction on the d-pad before pressing the Attack button). Both the Jump Attack and Jump Kick knock down enemies, while the Drop Attack leaves enemies open for Grab Attacks.[CR]New to the series (alongside the different types of jumping attacks) are two types of advanced attacks. The first type of attack (Single Attack) is performed by holding down the Attack button for a short period of time, then releasing it. The second type of attack (Blitz Attack) is performed by double-tapping either left or right on the d-pad and pressing the Attack button.Special Attacks[CR]Unlike the previous game, in which special attacks had it's own meter and was the same for each character (involving a time freeze while an officer arrives nearby in a cop car and fires weapons at the playfield), in Streets of Rage 2, each character has two types of unique Special Attacks. By pressing the Special Attack Button (defaulted to the A button), the character performs a powerful attack that deals damage and knocks down enemies at the cost of some of his/her health meter. If the health meter is nearly depleted, the special attack will not be performed.[CR]If the d-pad is not held left or right, pressing the Special Attack button performs one of these attacks:Alex (Dragon Wing) - Swings his fist around as a wave (resembling a dragon) surrounds it.Blaze (Embukyaku) - Performs a kicking backflip.Max (Knuckle Bomb) - Spins around with his fists outward.Skate (Double Spin Kick) - Spins around (on his head) with his legs outward.[CR]If the d-pad is held left or right, pressing the Special Attack button performs one of these attacks:Alex (Dragon Smash) - Throws an assortment of close-ranged punches ending with a powerful uppercut.Blaze (Kikousho) - Throws a short-ranged fireball.Max (Thunder Tackle) - Charges forward, dealing multiple hits at enemies in front of him.Skate (Corkscrew Kick) - Jumps up in the air and charges forward diagonally, dealing multiple hits at enemies in front of him.Grab Attacks[CR]By approaching enemies close enough (and not getting attacked), players automatically grab enemies from either the front or the back. After a short amount of time, they automatically release the enemy. By pressing the Jump button (as anyone other than Max), they perform a shoulder vault, alternating between Front Grab and Back Grab positions.[CR]In the Front Grab position, players can tap the Attack button to perform one of two types of combos (depending on if the d-pad is held in the forward direction) and use the Attack button while holding the opposite direction on the d-pad to throw the enemy behind him/her. In the Back Grab position, players can use the Attack button to perform a powerful body slam (or in Skate's case, a flurry of punches against the backside of the enemy's head).[CR]Weapons and Bonus Items[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Throughout the game, players can find weapons either dropped by enemies or by destroying certain objects (such as barrels, crates, and traffic cones). Players can equip a weapon by standing over it and pressing the Attack button. However, they can only pick up one weapon at a time, and picking up another weapon causes the player to drop the other weapon. The player also drops the weapon when he is knocked down or when he/she does a Rear Attack. Dropped weapons disappear over time.Knife - Powerful close-range attack, which can also be thrown (using the Rear Attack) at far enemies. Blaze's standard attack is a special double slash.Lead Pipe - Slow to attack, but powerful with a long range.

They are found by destroying objects (the same type of objects used to hold weapons) and are picked up using the Attack button.

It was composed using NEC PC-8801 hardware alongside Koshiro's own audio programming language. According to Koshiro: "For Bare Knuckle I used the PC88 and an original programming language I developed myself. The original was called MML, Music Macro Language. It's based on NEC's BASIC program, but I modified it heavily. It was more a BASIC-style language at first, but I modified it to be something more like Assembly. I called it &#8216;Music Love'. I used it for all the Bare Knuckle Games."[CR]The soundtrack was influenced by electronic dance music, specifically house, techno, hardcore techno, and breakbeat. The soundtrack for Streets of Rage 2 is considered "revolutionary" and ahead of its time, for its "blend of swaggering house synths," "dirty" electro-funk and "trancey electronic textures that would feel as comfortable in a nightclub as a video game."[CR]The soundtrack got a lot of positive reception for its techno based tracks which impressed many gamers and critics at the time especially due to the audio limitations of the Mega Drive/Genesis console. Most notably, the boss theme is considered one of the best boss themes in the 16-bit era. The reception for the soundtrack was so high that the game's music composer, Yuzo Koshiro, was invited to nightclubs to DJ the tracks.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Options[CR]On the options screen, set "Level" to "Easy", "Players" to 01, "BGM" to 02 and "SE" to 03.

It was ported to a number of other systems, but these versions are considered far below the arcade and Genesis editions. At the time, Strider seemed like one of the games that made the Genesis so unique, a home experience only to be later surpassed by Sonic the Hedgehog. Strider was one of Capcom's very first big Arcade hits, preceding Street Fighter II. The game was popular because the action was fast, furious, and original. The story sequences in Strider are also notable, as they had voiceovers in eight different languages.[CR]Starring Strider Hiryu, the game is based on the 1988 manga, called Strider Hiryu.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Yes, I do.[CR]In the year 2048, the world has been devastated by the Grandmaster Meio, an evil man who had watched the Earth from a distant nebula before taking over. He now rules the world with an iron fist from his space station, the Third Moon. On a distant island known as Moralos, the striders, the last defenders of the Earth are training to defeat Meio. Strider, the youngest and strongest of these warriors, is the man who takes up the task.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]This looks unsafe.[CR]Strider is a side-scrolling action game, with platforming elements throughout. The player controls Strider Hiryu, who can perform acrobatic jumps, climb up walls, and hang from ceilings. Strider must use his skill set to overcome a variety of obstacles, and progress through the game's five stages. Each stage is littered with enemies looking to stop Strider in his tracks, and Strider has brought along his massive blade to deal with them. The game is relatively simple, using only two buttons along with the directional pad, one button to jump, and one to attack. Most enemies go down in only a few hits, the bosses on each stage being the only exceptions. Strider will have to avoid getting hurt by enemies, as he only begins with three life. He can gain more by collecting life tokens when he has full health.[CR]There are a number of powerups scattered throughout the game, which have a variety of effects. The most basic powerup extends the length of Hiryu's sword. Another powerup will make Hiryu invulnerable for a brief period of time. Some of the more important bonuses include the robots which come to Hiryu's aid. The first of these robots is the Dipodal Saucer, who charges into Strider's enemies. Second is the Terapodal RoboPanther, a large cat robot who follows Hiryu and attacks any enemy in sight. The final upgrade is the Robot Hawk, which, once again, damages any enemies it encounters.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The soldiers in the background of the Genesis box cover are actually shamelessly copied from an earlier version of the Space Marine armor from the tabletop game Warhammer 40,000, complete with the distinct beaked helmet and bolter firearm for one, and the impractical studded shoulder pads for all of them.[CR]Prior to release, Strider was heavily hyped to be the first "8 MEG" (as in, 8 megabits) console game.

Her only notable characteristic, as far as this game is concerned, is the use of a weaponized metal yo-yo to pummel her foes.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is one part brawler, pitting the main character Suki against either a wave of criminals which she must defeat en masse or a single boss with a considerable amount of strength and health. The rest of the game is presented as a first-person adventure game, like Portopia and other text and point and click adventures available for Japanese home computers at the time. The player's actions in one mode generally leads them to the other, as enemies are met in the adventure's story and are then summarily dealt with in the brawler mode.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] How to access Continue[CR]First, you must defeat the bosses of Takanoha, Hakucho, and Seiryu High Schools.  Then on the GAME OVER screen when you are defeated by the bosses afterward, input the following command to access the CONTINUE option.  You will now end up in Saki's room.</plot>				<releasedate>19/4/1987</releasedate>				<genre>Adventure, Miscellaneous</genre>				<studio>Sega</studio>				<videoid>yE0ecrmlkfg</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3037</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570159-sukeban-deka-ii-shoujo-tekkamen-densetsu</gamefaqs_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/sukeban-deka-ii-shoujo-tekkamen-densetsu/3030-39451/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3037-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/box/5/5/2/306552_back.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/d/7/e/gfs_8589_2_1.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/a/e/gfs_8589_2_2.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/e/1/e/gfs_8589_2_3.jpg</snapshot3>			</game>			<game name="Summer Games (Europe)">				<description>Summer Games (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FSummer%20Games%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="70016" />				<title_clean>Summer Games</title_clean>				<plot>Summer Games allows up to eight players to compete in a series of summer themed Olympic events.

Despite this, they are an improvement on Super Boy 3's due to the Master System having better graphical capabilities than the MSX or SG-1000.

These versions lack the Ironman license, but the gameplay is all but identical. The player, along with either another human player or up to three AI opponents, race around a single-screen track in a format similar to Atari's Super Sprint. The player can upgrade their car's stats with the money earned after each race, or purchase more Nitro for one-off speed boosts.[CR]Different versions have different features. The SNES version has twice as many tracks as the original Arcade game (sixteen rather than eight), and the NES version allows up to four players to play with the NES Satellite or Four Score peripherals.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Gear version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 5,6,4,5 adding, "...after a while it does get tough on the eyes and I found I could not play for very long. The truck controlled well and was faithful to the arcade game, but just too small.".[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1989</releasedate>				<genre>Driving, Racing</genre>				<studio>U.S. Gold</studio>				<videoid>WSZxVrJ73QA</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3041</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570252-super-off-road</gamefaqs_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/super-off-road/3030-32988/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3041-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3041-1.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2689573-superoffroad001.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2546175-super+off+road+%28j%29006.png</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2546174-super+off+road+%28j%29005.png</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2546172-super+off+road+%28j%29003.png</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2546171-super+off+road+%28j%29002.png</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2546170-super+off+road+%28j%29001.png</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2546169-super+off+road+%28j%29000.png</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/98041/1564828-game.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/98041/1564827-title..jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/4/a/c/gfs_91710_1_1.jpg</snapshot10>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/3041.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Super Racing (Japan)">				<description>Super Racing (Japan)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FSuper%20Racing%20%28Japan%29.zip" size="109284" />				<title_clean>Super Racing</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Racing is a top-down racing game that allows the player to compete in a series of Formula 1 races, first by doing a time trial "practice" on each course to determine their starting position for the actual race, which includes CPU opponents. Upon starting the game the player can choose from a "Real Mode" and a "BGM Mode" - all that is that different is that the latter option provides background music.[CR]The game takes a few measures for the sake of realism, including coming into the pit stop area if the car is getting too damaged and letting players select from a model that emphasizes speed or one that emphasizes turning.

The world's most popular television show is Smash T.V., an ultra-violent contest between two armed-to-the-teeth combatants, set loose in a series of deadly arenas that are filled to bursting with hordes of mindless beasts and killer robots. The aim of the game is to blast everything in sight and try to grab more cash and prizes than the other guy. Toaster ovens, VCRs, fancy cars and luxury holidays are there for the taking... for anyone who can survive long enough to enjoy them.[CR]Smash T.V. is an insane shoot-em-up from the brain of Eugene Jarvis, creator of Robotron: 2084. It retains that game's frantic style of play and two-joystick control method, but adds plenty of gore, violence, a hint of satire and that all-important two player mode.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/smash-tv[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1992</releasedate>				<genre>Shooter</genre>				<studio>Flying Edge</studio>				<videoid>z_I5IxpqTnU</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3043</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570244-super-smash-tv</gamefaqs_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/smash-tv/3030-16194/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3043-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3043-1.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7395/1631904-alien_woman.png</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/7395/1631903-alien.png</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/10026/619921-smash_tv_04.gif</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/10026/619920-smash_tv_03.gif</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/10026/619919-smash_tv_02.gif</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/10026/619918-smash_tv_01.gif</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/10906/528246-smash_tv.png</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/5087/428000-screenshot004.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/5087/427999-screenshot003.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/5087/427998-screenshot002.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Super Space Invaders (Europe)">				<description>Super Space Invaders (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FSuper%20Space%20Invaders%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="136931" />				<title_clean>Super Space Invaders</title_clean>				<plot>Space Invaders is the most famous video game ever!

Then you drive across the city without crashing into other cars, and catch up with the criminal's car. To arrest the suspects, you must keep bumping into their car until it is no longer functional. And you have to do this under a strict time limit. You can't afford to crash into cars or buildings or you waste time getting on the road again.[CR]However, once you've caught up with your suspect, you are given more time. Your car is also equipped with turbo boosts, which you can use to gain extra speed if you are way behind the criminal.

football (also known as soccer). Even though there was no World Cup held in 1993 the game Tecmo World Cup 93 has the main teams and rules the World Cup is famous for.[CR]Tecmo World Cup 93 is a football game that simulates the World Cup from the Pools to the elimination rounds that end with the finals. It has the option to play the 24 most known countries to have played in the World Cup, each with players having there own skill levels based on the real teams. There are 3 more modes to chose from that includes Versus where the player can play against a friend, Exhibition where one the player picks a opponent to play a single match, and Watch where the player picks two CPU players to battle it out alone.[CR]When playing a game the player first picks the team they want to play (and there opponents team if in Exhibition mode) and the color of there jersey before the CPU picks a random jersey color for their team. Before the match starts the player can set up the formation of the team and can also set up who plays and their position, this menu can also be accessed when a goal is scored or the ball goes out. The players (that are all abbreviated to there initials) have stats for Power, Speed, and Technique. When the game starts the player is presented with a side on birds eye view of the field. The player, when in control of the ball can pass the ball to the closest team mate or attempt for a goal. When defending the player can change the controlling player or do a slide tackle (slide tackle is the only tackle the player can do). There is no penalties in the game other then kicking the ball out. The game is fast paced as it is played in sped up mode to get a full game in a reduced time. There are 3 levels of difficulty and the default game length can be changed in the configuration. Password save after each match is available.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1993</releasedate>				<year>1993</year>				<genre>Sports</genre>				<studio>SEGA Entertainment, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<videoid>y9SETrZ-PUQ</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3051</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570214-tecmo-world-cup-93</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/tecmo-world-cup-93</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/tecmo-world-cup-93/3030-23136/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/16/164924/2582963-4339507337-57021.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/276683-tecmo-world-cup-93-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/276685-tecmo-world-cup-93-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/337643-tecmo-world-cup-93-sega-master-system-screenshot-starting.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/337644-tecmo-world-cup-93-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/337646-tecmo-world-cup-93-sega-master-system-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/337645-tecmo-world-cup-93-sega-master-system-screenshot-selecting.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/337647-tecmo-world-cup-93-sega-master-system-screenshot-it-s-usa.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/337648-tecmo-world-cup-93-sega-master-system-screenshot-my-first.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/337649-tecmo-world-cup-93-sega-master-system-screenshot-setting-up.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/337650-tecmo-world-cup-93-sega-master-system-screenshot-kick-off.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/337651-tecmo-world-cup-93-sega-master-system-screenshot-got-the-ball.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/337652-tecmo-world-cup-93-sega-master-system-screenshot-but-it-goes.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3051-1.jpg</fanart1>			</game>			<game name="Teddy Boy (USA, Europe)">				<description>Teddy Boy (USA, Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FTeddy%20Boy%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" size="21092" />				<title_clean>Teddy Boy</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Teddy Boy Blues was originally an 1985 Arcade platformer that was later ported to the Sega Master System (which was still then known as the Sega-1000 Mark III) and became one of its launch titles when the system was released in Japan in October the same year.

You're the Tennis Ace! ~ From the blurb on the back of the case.   Game Modes- Training Match- In the training match, you play to practice and improve your skill level. This mode can be selected only when one person is playing. The first to win three games wins the match. Exhibition Match- If one person is playing, select either single play (player 1 vs the computer) or doubles (player 1 vs computer, computer, computer) when two are playing, you can choose to play at the same time (against each other, or doubles against the computer, or doubles against each other), or take turns.Grand Slam Tournament- When you select this option, a map of the world will be displayed on the screen, showing the various countries in which you will compete, one at a time. The sequence includes: Japan, Australia, Italy, France, and the United States.    Singles play commences first. You will be displayed at the top of the roster. When singles play is over, doubles play will start.   If you win three consecutive matches in singles and doubles in a country, you become that winner in that country and move onto the next tournament. If you lose during a tournament, you can press CONTINUE and play the match again.     Open Tournament- To play in the open tournament, you need to install two control pads into the power base. To play, select one of the countries that hosts a Grand Slam Tournament. Play commences, but the action ends after the tournament is over; you cannot advance to other tournaments.

/>				<title_clean>Thunder Blade</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Thunderblade is an arcade game by Sega. In this game you take control of a helicopter and destroy air and ground threats while avoiding buildings. It is one of the early games to make use of Sega's Super Scaler technology (along with Space Harrier, Hang-On, OutRun, and After Burner), which scaled sprites and allowed them to seem as if they were different distances away from the player, giving the game a pseudo-3D perspective. In the case of Thunder Blade, this made buildings to appear to have height and depth to them, as well as making it seem enemies were coming into view from below as the helicopter flies through the streets.[CR]The game intermittently switches from a vertical scrolling top-down perspective to that of a third-person "behind the helicopter" view in which it appears to travel forwards into the screen, on a Z-axis. Both viewpoints play the same: The player must use a mix of weaponry to attack both rival helicopters in the air and enemy tanks on the ground, all the while avoiding the nearby buildings.[CR]Arcade cabinets[CR]The original arcade version was released for the Sega X Board hardware. The game came in two different cabinets. The standard upright cabinet featured, like Space Harrier and After Burner, an analog flight stick and force feedback.[CR]The other, more expensive, cabinet was the deluxe sit-down cabinet, where the player sits on a helicopter seat and the seat moves in sync with the chopper's movements, with the player controlling the motion of the seat. The monitor of the deluxe cabinet is decorated with various dials and graphics to simulate the look of a real helicopter cockpit.[CR]Console ports[CR]The game was a huge arcade hit and Sega would port the game to many consoles, including both of their own consoles, Master System and Mega Drive / Genesis, as well as many other systems.

In this game you take control of a helicopter and destroy air and ground threats while avoiding buildings. It is one of the early games to make use of Sega's Super Scaler technology (along with Space Harrier, Hang-On, OutRun, and After Burner), which scaled sprites and allowed them to seem as if they were different distances away from the player, giving the game a pseudo-3D perspective. In the case of Thunder Blade, this made buildings to appear to have height and depth to them, as well as making it seem enemies were coming into view from below as the helicopter flies through the streets.[CR]The game intermittently switches from a vertical scrolling top-down perspective to that of a third-person "behind the helicopter" view in which it appears to travel forwards into the screen, on a Z-axis. Both viewpoints play the same: The player must use a mix of weaponry to attack both rival helicopters in the air and enemy tanks on the ground, all the while avoiding the nearby buildings.[CR]Arcade cabinets[CR]The original arcade version was released for the Sega X Board hardware. The game came in two different cabinets. The standard upright cabinet featured, like Space Harrier and After Burner, an analog flight stick and force feedback.[CR]The other, more expensive, cabinet was the deluxe sit-down cabinet, where the player sits on a helicopter seat and the seat moves in sync with the chopper's movements, with the player controlling the motion of the seat. The monitor of the deluxe cabinet is decorated with various dials and graphics to simulate the look of a real helicopter cockpit.[CR]Console ports[CR]The game was a huge arcade hit and Sega would port the game to many consoles, including both of their own consoles, Master System and Mega Drive / Genesis, as well as many other systems. These versions generally weren't able to properly mimic the effects of the Super Scaler technology, however.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Continue Stage[CR]Normally, you are not allowed to continue after you have died. At the ''Game Over'' screen, quickly hold Down and Right on the D-Pad and push Button 2 as you hold Down and Right. You will start off at the stage in which you died!

In an attempt to thwart his plans to conquer the planet, Yohan, Ben and five of the Earth Command Troopers tried to infiltrate Gylends stronghold and discover the source of his power, so that he could be defeated.[CR]Unfortunately they were discovered before they could successfully fullfil their mission. Gylend then turned five of the troopers into red gleaming energy balls and threw them into the endless void of time.[CR]Only Yohan and Ben were spared by the evil overlord, who told them that they would be given a chance to rescue their comrades. Should they be able to locate them in the different time zones and rescue them, they would also be given the opportunity to fight Gylend for the ownership of Earth![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Time Soldiers can be played in single player or in two player mode. The player starts the game with three lives. Anytime they are hit by a enemy or one of the projectiles they lose a life. After they have lost all three lives they can gain up to two continues by pressing the primary fire two times before the game over screen appears. It is a little odd why there are no normal continues in the game because this "secret" can be found in the manual, but this is probably how Time Soldiers rolls. The player can continue the game exactly where they died, but they lose all of the equipment they had. An advantage of the 2 player mode is that the player who died will automatically revive as long as the other one is still alive.Stages[CR]To rescue all of the five missing troopers the player must pass through five different time zones. Four of them are set in the past and one of them is in the future. Interestingly, the player does not begin the game in the same era every time they play. It is always one of the earlier zones, though. And, as might be expected, they will never start the game in Gylend's stage...[CR]Each of the time zones is divided into three stages. At the end of each stage the player has to battle a Mid Boss.[CR]After he is defeated a portal opens which will bring the player to a different time zone. When reaching the stage where their comrade is located, they also have to fight the so-called Big Boss. Defeat him and one of the comrades will be saved.[CR]The time zones and the corresponding enemies are:Brokeratops and Bitekan from the Primitive Era.Primitive Era:BrokeratopsCryptogramPurtasaurBitekanAruma (Middle Boss)Ankirosaurus (Middle Boss)Big Brokera (Middle Boss)Tyrasaurus (Big Boss)Ancient Rome:Bow ManPharantasRoman SwordsmanRoman GhostMedusa (Middle Boss)Anubis (Middle Boss)Tri-Neck Dragon (Middle Boss)Minotaur (Big Boss)Medieval Japan:Fire Throwing SoldierKappa (River Monster)NinjaPiper MonkSamurai (Middle Boss)Tengu (Middle Boss)Dark Monk (Middle Boss)Kabuki (Big Boss)The Large Tank from World War 2.World War 2Wild GeesePrivateMIL-29 (Middle Boss)Ratto Willis (Middle Boss)T-87 (Middle Boss)Hainder (Middle Boss)Large Tank (Big Boss)Future WorldDisco FighterSpark ShooterA-LineManrasu (Middle Boss)Nike (MIddle Boss)Gorugo (Big Boss)Gylend the Conqueror.Gylend's WorldRideruGerondo-DGylend (The Conqueror)Extras[CR]Some of the normal enemies the player defeats will also leave extras behind which can be picked up. There are three extras which will provide a secondary fire for weapons and three which will give the player special abilities. The power of the secondary fire increases depending on the stage they are in.[CR]Special Weapons:Tri-Shot: Shoots in three different directions.Missile: Can fly over obstacles.Energy Gun: High-power energy bullet.[CR]Ability Items:Speed Up: Increases the speed of the player's movement.Power-Up: The weapon will fire as if fully automatic. Movement diminishes the power.Warp: The player will be instantly warped to the Big Boss.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Continues[CR]At the Game over screen push Up, Up, Down, Down, Button 2.

software for their new console, the SG-1000 Mark III (or Sega Master System). Along with Satellite 7, it was developed so that players could play the then-popular shoot 'em up genre, of which Sega was a known developer, at home.[CR]With early arcade titles from Sega like Fantasy Zone, the company earned some recognition for their ability to make fun space shoot-em-up games that played well and were appealing to both the eyes and ears. Sega began tinkering around with the genre using the idea of luck and timing based power-up acquisition mechanics. Deciding to stay away from the charming dayglo atmosphere of Fantasy Zone, they instead went for a more intense and gritty dystopian future which called for an elevation in difficulty compared to most shoot-em-up games. The end result was TransBot.[CR]TransBot was originally released in Japan in late 1985, a couple of months after the Sega Master System (then still known as the SG-1000 Mark III) was launched. It is known as Astro Flash in that territory. It would later be released in both the US and Europe the following year with the name TransBot (sometimes styled as Transbot) with two versions: one that used the card-based format, and one that used the newer cartridge-based format. The game was also released in Brazil by Tec Toy, and this version was named Nuclear Creature.[CR]In 1987 Sega released the game to Arcades with a graphical improvement and the ability to switch between the robot and jet forms whenever the player wished (usually, the robot form only appeared once certain power-ups had been attained). This version was called Transformer in the US.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]It is the Solar year 2000. The Nuclear War has just ended and civilization is striving to restore what was lost as a result of the conflict. The civilians left their underground fallout shelters and began to rebuild a new world atop the ashes of the war marred past. With new communities and even technological breakthroughs in transportation technology, the Nuclear War survivors began to prosper once more.Surviving in the world of Transbot is not easy.[CR]However, unbeknownst to the people, there is evil looming in the air. Dalaus, an artificial intelligence super computer has also survived the Nuclear War. Dalaus was used and programmed with the sole purpose of destroying anything and everything. In the time the survivors spent rebuilding Dalaus had built up an entire subterranean empire and an invasion army ready to destroy the survivors once and for all. The survivors were caught off guard and didn't stand a chance as Dalaus' army ripped through the many metropolises that the people worked so hard and so passionately to rebuild.[CR]The defense force is a fleet of CA-214 models, which are sophisticated astro-planes capable of transforming into a humanoid battle mech. With universal munitions applications, it would seem that the survivors would have defeated the Dalaus invasion. However, Dalaus had corrupted many of those who had been placed in military positions by the survivors. They destroyed nearly every single CA-214 and assassinated nearly every pilot for the ships. Only one pilot survives and manages to escape with his life and his CA-214 or TransBot.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Fighting the final boss, Elgramzon.[CR]The game TransBot is a side scrolling space shooter. The player controls the TransBot and shoots incoming enemies on the right. The directional pad of the Sega Controller moves the player's TransBot in all directions. Button 2 is used to fire whatever weapon the TransBot has currently equipped. Button 1 selects what weapon to use after the munitions select mechanic is started. The most noteworthy mechanic in TransBot is the munitions section sub-screen. To initiate this mechanic the player must first come across one of Dalaus' munitions trucks. By destroying the truck and collecting the question mark icon the player now can pick one of eight weapon types. The weapon sub screen begins a minigame process where it cycles through the letters A to H (A to F indicates various weapons and G is an ammunition power-up) in a roulette fashion. It tends to cycle though these letters quick, so paying attention to what weapon is being selected while fighting an onslaught of enemies in real time can be quite a challenge. The player will most likely find themselves maneuvering all over the screen in order to avoid enemy collision rather than just sitting put or even just moving up and down.Transbot: The Sega Card.[CR]The enemies do not necessarily use AI, but they do maneuver about the screen in formation patterns that are selected at random. There are special parts in TransBot where the player can enter Dalaus' subterranean lair, which is one of the two major environments in the game including the planet's surface. The health system is interesting because it does not follow the pre-established conventions of the space shooter genre. Usually if one gets hit once or even twice the player loses a life. However, TransBot changes that with a life meter with several notches. Once the health bar's indication needle hits the far left end of the bar the player's ship is destroyed, resulting in a lost life. The player starts with three lives, and the game is over when all the lives are exhuasted. The player can gain an extra by first obtaining 40,000 points and every extra life after that requires another 80,000 points every time. The same system is put into effect for the weapon ammunition aspect of the game. When using the Normal Fire weapon mode, the player has unlimited ammunition because that is the native weapon of the CA-214. However, when the player acquires a new weapon the player is met with a limited supply of ammunition for that particular weapon. Once the ammunition supply for that weapon is exhausted the CA-214's primary reverts back the Normal Fire mode.[CR]Release Formats[CR]The overworld level.[CR]Though TransBot came out exclusively for the Sega Master System, there are two different releases on this one title. TransBot came out on a Sega Mega Cartridge as well as a Sega Game Card. The only significant difference between the two formats is that the Sega Game Card version does not contain an ending or resolution of any kind and just plays on forever. However, with the Mega Cartridge release of TransBot, the game does have an ending and closes out with a resolution. However, The Sega Card version of TransBot was the more popular as it was cheaper and yet the graphical and audio quality was equal the the Mega Cartridge version.Weapon ModesA-Normal-Fire: The original weapon configuration of the CA-214 which behaves like a machine gun.B-Beam: Shoots a ring-like beam of energy.C-Sword Fire: Hurls a blade-like beam of energy that can destroy multiple foes.D-Cannon: Energy cannon that uses particle projection technology.E-Diffusion-Beam: Energy weapon that fires in a spread fire fashion.F-Two-Direction-Fire: Fires two shells in either direction.G-Power-up-Attack: Replenishes ammunition supply.Enemies and Point ValuesArm Carrier &#8211; 1,000 PointsLuvogue &#8211; 120 PointsPsyball &#8211; 100 PointsElblink &#8211; 120 PointsBifler (Quick) &#8211; 100 PointsBifler (Slow) &#8211; 80 PointsAlapot &#8211; 120 PointsAscule &#8211; 120 PointsZelnuc &#8211; 200 PointsGelpaar &#8211; 180 PointsBoasite &#8211; 240 PointsGealmea &#8211; 240 PointsHilun &#8211; 500 PointsBarrier &#8211; 400 PointsElgramzon- 20,000 PointsWorld Record AttemptsJon Rivera's highest recorded score [verified].[CR]The first officially verified world record for first place high score was recognized on June 11th of 2004. It was 66,000 points and was held by James Carter and was globally recognized through the Twin Galaxies International Scoreboard. However, Jon Rivera had made many attempts to attain the world record and achieve a higher score. He had recorded a record winning game of 502,040 points in one play session of TransBot. Jon Rivera's record winning score was approved on September 9th of 2009 and is now the official first place high score. This record was approved by Nik Meeks, a referee of the Twin Galaxies Scoreboard.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Secret menu[CR]On control one, hold button 2 and Down on the D-pad when turning on the system.

The game involves answering questions on one of six subject categories to gain moves, and answering questions on special squares to gain one of the six 'Wedges' you need to gain the right to take on the final winning question. Questions are aimed at British players - many entertainment questions are based on British TV, and sport questions relate to popular British sports.[CR]Two game modes are available:- single player (which involves answering questions against the clock) and multiplayer (where you can take on up to five human-controlled players). The computer reveals the answer, and you select 'yes' or 'no' to tell it whether you got it right.[CR]The question categories are exactly the same as the board game, however two different question styles are added to take advantage of computer technology - some questions relate to a picture or diagram and some relate to a piece of music.[CR]One additional feature not available in the board game is a statistical analysis of the number and type of questions answered correctly. This can be split into the performances of all the players, or the performance of an individual player within the six categories. It is especially useful at the end of the game, when choosing which category a player must answer to win the game.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/trivial-pursuit[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1992</releasedate>				<year>1992</year>				<genre>Board Game</genre>				<studio>Domark</studio>				<nplayers>1-4 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>				<videoid>JwRSKAIREqY</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3090</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570264-trivial-pursuit</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/trivial-pursuit</mobygames_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3090-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/249608-trivial-pursuit-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/249610-trivial-pursuit-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/333135-trivial-pursuit-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/333136-trivial-pursuit-sega-master-system-screenshot-language-selection.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/333137-trivial-pursuit-sega-master-system-screenshot-start-of-a-new.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/333138-trivial-pursuit-sega-master-system-screenshot-options-screen.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/333139-trivial-pursuit-sega-master-system-screenshot-first-of-the.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/333140-trivial-pursuit-sega-master-system-screenshot-and-i-rolled.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/333141-trivial-pursuit-sega-master-system-screenshot-now-where-should.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/333142-trivial-pursuit-sega-master-system-screenshot-gone-with-science.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/333143-trivial-pursuit-sega-master-system-screenshot-when-time-is.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/333144-trivial-pursuit-sega-master-system-screenshot-oh-well.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Ttoriui Moheom (Korea)">				<description>Ttoriui Moheom (Korea)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FTtoriui%20Moheom%20%28Korea%29.zip" size="22960" />				<title_clean>Ttoriui Moheom</title_clean>				<plot>A bunch of seedy punks - complete with mohawks - try to steal your girl.

Released in 1985 for the Apple II and then for the Commodore 64 and the IBM PC, Ultima IV departed from the "kill the evil wizard" plot of the earlier games of the series and encouraged the player to complete the Quest of the Avatar by mastering eight virtues and finding the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The basic gameplay in Ultima IV is not substantially different from Ultima III. However, Ultima IV introduces the concept of virtue as a foundation that governs the player's identity and progress. The player creates their protagonist at the start of the game by answering a series of questions about what he or she would do in a morally ambiguous situation. The player's answers determine which of the eight virtues he or she is most closely aligned to, and then the player begins the game with a character of the class which represents that virtue. The player's representative class and virtue also determine the city in which the player starts the game.[CR]There are eight virtues in the game, each represented by a class, a city, and a dungeon. The virtues themselves are built on the three principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. In each city, the player encounters a character of the class representative of the city's virtue, that under the right circumstances can join the player's party for a maximum total of eight party members.[CR]Inspiration for the eight virtues and three principles is found in a number of sources, including Buddhism and Hinduism, and as Richard Garriott himself said, the Wizard of Oz.The VirtuesVirtueFromCityDungeonClassHonestyTruthMoonglowDeceitMageCompassionLoveBritainDespiseBardValorCourageJhelomDestardFighterJusticeTruth and LoveYewWrongDruidSacrificeLove and CourageMinocCovetousTinkerHonorTruth and CourageTrinsicShamePaladinSpiritualityTruth, Love, and CourageSkara BraeHythlothRangerHumilityNoneNew MaginciaStygian AbyssShepherdConversations[CR]The conversation system is built on the foundation found in Ultima III, allowing the player to engage with NPCs with the key words "name", "job", and "health" and then by repeating phrases from the NPC's speech. In console versions of the game, text entry is replaced with a list of conversation topics that the player can choose from.Combat[CR]Combat is similar to Ultima III, but now spells require reageants which must be purchased (or found) and mixed in advance of combat. When the player enters a battle encounter, the player can choose to move party members individually one square per turn, cast magic, or attack from melee or long range (if the party members are appropriately equipped). There is also an "Auto" option that allows the computer to pick the action that the party member will take.Exploration[CR]While exploring the overworld, the player has access to the moongates; magical gates that were introduced in Ultima III. The availability of these gates are dependent on the phases of the two moons, which determine which gates are currently open and their destinations. However, unlike Ultima III, the game does not feature an "underworld" like Ambrosia.[CR]Dungeon exploration in Ultima IV continues to use first-person, 3D hallways, but now also features rooms depicted from an overhead view as well.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The player is tasked by Britannia's Lord British to become an Avatar by reaching enlightenment in each of the eight virtues. The player's standing in each of the virtues is determined by actions taken during gameplay. Positive influences include refraining from stealing (i.e.: Not opening treasure chests found in towns or castles), giving gold to beggars and blood (Hit Points) to healers, meditating, answering NPCs' questions properly, not fleeing from combat, and letting non-evil creatures encountered during combat flee.[CR]Once a player has reached the required level in a given virtue (the seer Hawkwind in Castle Britannia keeps the player appraised of his or her virtue) he or she must meditate at the shrine corresponding to the virtue. When the player has completed this task for all eight virtues, he or she is ready to take on the Abyss to find the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom.[CR]To accomplish this final task, the player must use eight colored stones (one found in each of the eight dungeons) to find the three parts of a key. Once the key is acquired, the player must then descend into the eight levels of the Abyss. Once the player has reached the bottom of the Abyss, he or she must answer a series of questions. If the player answers any of these questions incorrectly, the player character is warped back to the surface world and forced to navigate the Abyss again from the start. Should the player succeed and answer all of the questions correctly, he or she obtains the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom and becomes the Avatar.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Ultima IV created the foundation of the rest of the Ultima series. All of the subsequent games would take place in or in relation to the world of Britannia and would reinterpret the virtues and the basic structure of the world. In later games, Richard Garriott would relativize the "goody two-shoes" story of Ultima IV by showing the unintended consequences of this single-minded quest for goodness. The antagonist of Ultima V would impose a totalitarian regime based on the virtues. It would be revealed that by taking the Codex from the bottom of the Abyss, the Avatar set into motion the destruction of the Gargoyles' world, and that by becoming the Avatar he or she spawned an evil alter-ego, the Guardian.[CR]The story of Ultima IV is extremely open-ended. The moongates allow the player to access any area of the game from the beginning, and the virtues and dungeons can be tackled in any order, except for the game-ending Abyss. The open-ended nature of the game would give way to a more tightly scripted story in later games.[CR]NES Version[CR]A version of Ultima IV entitled Ultima: Quest of the Avatar was made for the NES. The game's graphics were completely redrawn in a style similar to that of Japanese RPGs of the era such as the Dragon Quest series, and certain gameplay systems were streamlined for better playability on a console, rather than a PC with a keyboard. Otherwise, the game's structure and content are largely identical to the PC version. This version of the game was developed by Japanese company Infinity, which would go on to adapt the first two Populous games for Super Famicom and the Sharp X68000, and was published by Pony Canyon.[CR]Availability[CR]As of September 2011, Ultima IV is available at Good Old Games. It has also been released as part of the "Ultima 4+5+6" package.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>16/9/1985</releasedate>				<year>1990</year>				<genre>RPG</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd., SEGA of America, Inc., Tec Toy Ind&#250;stria de Brinquedos S.A.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.7</rating>				<videoid>7vDK2Uxi9QM</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3091</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588164-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar/3030-14381/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8322</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3091-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3091-1.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50406-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50407-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50408-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50409-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50410-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50411-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50412-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50413-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212707-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212708-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot10>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/iKBi1Wl.png</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Ultima IV - Quest of the Avatar (Europe) (Beta)">				<description>Ultima IV - Quest of the Avatar (Europe) (Beta)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FUltima%20IV%20-%20Quest%20of%20the%20Avatar%20%28Europe%29%20%28Beta%29.zip" size="241032" />				<title_clean>Ultima IV - Quest of the Avatar</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar is the fourth entry in Richard Garriott's long-running and influential Ultima series of role playing games.

In each city, the player encounters a character of the class representative of the city's virtue, that under the right circumstances can join the player's party for a maximum total of eight party members.[CR]Inspiration for the eight virtues and three principles is found in a number of sources, including Buddhism and Hinduism, and as Richard Garriott himself said, the Wizard of Oz.The VirtuesVirtueFromCityDungeonClassHonestyTruthMoonglowDeceitMageCompassionLoveBritainDespiseBardValorCourageJhelomDestardFighterJusticeTruth and LoveYewWrongDruidSacrificeLove and CourageMinocCovetousTinkerHonorTruth and CourageTrinsicShamePaladinSpiritualityTruth, Love, and CourageSkara BraeHythlothRangerHumilityNoneNew MaginciaStygian AbyssShepherdConversations[CR]The conversation system is built on the foundation found in Ultima III, allowing the player to engage with NPCs with the key words "name", "job", and "health" and then by repeating phrases from the NPC's speech. In console versions of the game, text entry is replaced with a list of conversation topics that the player can choose from.Combat[CR]Combat is similar to Ultima III, but now spells require reageants which must be purchased (or found) and mixed in advance of combat. When the player enters a battle encounter, the player can choose to move party members individually one square per turn, cast magic, or attack from melee or long range (if the party members are appropriately equipped). There is also an "Auto" option that allows the computer to pick the action that the party member will take.Exploration[CR]While exploring the overworld, the player has access to the moongates; magical gates that were introduced in Ultima III. The availability of these gates are dependent on the phases of the two moons, which determine which gates are currently open and their destinations. However, unlike Ultima III, the game does not feature an "underworld" like Ambrosia.[CR]Dungeon exploration in Ultima IV continues to use first-person, 3D hallways, but now also features rooms depicted from an overhead view as well.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The player is tasked by Britannia's Lord British to become an Avatar by reaching enlightenment in each of the eight virtues. The player's standing in each of the virtues is determined by actions taken during gameplay. Positive influences include refraining from stealing (i.e.: Not opening treasure chests found in towns or castles), giving gold to beggars and blood (Hit Points) to healers, meditating, answering NPCs' questions properly, not fleeing from combat, and letting non-evil creatures encountered during combat flee.[CR]Once a player has reached the required level in a given virtue (the seer Hawkwind in Castle Britannia keeps the player appraised of his or her virtue) he or she must meditate at the shrine corresponding to the virtue. When the player has completed this task for all eight virtues, he or she is ready to take on the Abyss to find the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom.[CR]To accomplish this final task, the player must use eight colored stones (one found in each of the eight dungeons) to find the three parts of a key. Once the key is acquired, the player must then descend into the eight levels of the Abyss. Once the player has reached the bottom of the Abyss, he or she must answer a series of questions. If the player answers any of these questions incorrectly, the player character is warped back to the surface world and forced to navigate the Abyss again from the start. Should the player succeed and answer all of the questions correctly, he or she obtains the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom and becomes the Avatar.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Ultima IV created the foundation of the rest of the Ultima series. All of the subsequent games would take place in or in relation to the world of Britannia and would reinterpret the virtues and the basic structure of the world. In later games, Richard Garriott would relativize the "goody two-shoes" story of Ultima IV by showing the unintended consequences of this single-minded quest for goodness. The antagonist of Ultima V would impose a totalitarian regime based on the virtues. It would be revealed that by taking the Codex from the bottom of the Abyss, the Avatar set into motion the destruction of the Gargoyles' world, and that by becoming the Avatar he or she spawned an evil alter-ego, the Guardian.[CR]The story of Ultima IV is extremely open-ended. The moongates allow the player to access any area of the game from the beginning, and the virtues and dungeons can be tackled in any order, except for the game-ending Abyss. The open-ended nature of the game would give way to a more tightly scripted story in later games.[CR]NES Version[CR]A version of Ultima IV entitled Ultima: Quest of the Avatar was made for the NES. The game's graphics were completely redrawn in a style similar to that of Japanese RPGs of the era such as the Dragon Quest series, and certain gameplay systems were streamlined for better playability on a console, rather than a PC with a keyboard. Otherwise, the game's structure and content are largely identical to the PC version. This version of the game was developed by Japanese company Infinity, which would go on to adapt the first two Populous games for Super Famicom and the Sharp X68000, and was published by Pony Canyon.[CR]Availability[CR]As of September 2011, Ultima IV is available at Good Old Games. It has also been released as part of the "Ultima 4+5+6" package.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>16/9/1985</releasedate>				<year>1990</year>				<genre>RPG</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd., SEGA of America, Inc., Tec Toy Ind&#250;stria de Brinquedos S.A.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>1st-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.7</rating>				<videoid>7vDK2Uxi9QM</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3091</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588164-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar/3030-14381/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8322</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/1/15693/608563-ultima4_1_.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3091-1.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50406-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50407-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50408-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50409-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50410-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50411-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50412-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/50413-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212707-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212708-ultima-iv-quest-of-the-avatar-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot10>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/iKBi1Wl.png</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Ultimate Soccer (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It)">				<description>Ultimate Soccer (Europe) (En,Fr,De,Es,It)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FUltimate%20Soccer%20%28Europe%29%20%28En%2CFr%2CDe%2CEs%2CIt%29.zip" size="134051" />				<title_clean>Ultimate Soccer</title_clean>				<plot>Ultimate Soccer is a football (European) game composed by 64 (unlicensed) international teams, each with it's own values for running, ball control and strength. There are five game modes (friendly, penalty shootout, tournament, playoff and league), but the lack of password or built-in battery means each one of them must be completed in one sitting.[CR]The gameplay can be tweaked for the players' preference by changing several key aspects of the physics engine, such as wind strength and direction, ball weight (lighter balls travel higher, faster  and farther but are more prone to be deflected by winds than heavy balls, who barely lift of the ground and are slowed down by wet grass), tightness of ball control and players speed and momentum. A five-a-side mode, where the ball is never out of play is also included. Thanks to the many options regarding the physics, the game allows a lot of flexibility in playmaking, from building up the play with small passes from the midfield to belting the ball upwards in hope of a goalmouth deflection.[CR]Graphically, the game is similar to EA's Madden NFL series, with pseudo-3D effects allowing the view to be tilted up to show more detail up front or tilted down to show more of the field. [CR]The series later continued with Striker on the same console and Striker' 96 on PC, Saturn and PlayStation.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1993</releasedate>				<year>1993</year>				<genre>Sports</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.6</rating>				<videoid>9FZ7Lvl0BRg</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3093</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/939436-ultimate-soccer</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/ultimate-soccer</mobygames_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3093-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/149157-ultimate-soccer-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/149158-ultimate-soccer-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144272-ultimate-soccer-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144273-ultimate-soccer-sega-master-system-screenshot-choose-your.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144274-ultimate-soccer-sega-master-system-screenshot-main-menu.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144275-ultimate-soccer-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-demo-match.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144276-ultimate-soccer-sega-master-system-screenshot-portugal-advances.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144277-ultimate-soccer-sega-master-system-screenshot-portugal-scores.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144278-ultimate-soccer-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-triumphant.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144279-ultimate-soccer-sega-master-system-screenshot-kick-off.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144281-ultimate-soccer-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-penalty-game.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/144283-ultimate-soccer-sega-master-system-screenshot-angola-tricks.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Vampire (Europe) (Beta)">				<description>Vampire (Europe) (Beta)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FVampire%20%28Europe%29%20%28Beta%29.zip" size="164481" />				<title_clean>Vampire</title_clean>				<plot>The shadow of Dracula has spread over Victorian England.

The goal is to pass through six stages, fighting off waves of enemies from both directions and defeating the boss at the end of each one, and eventually rescue the main character's kidnapped girlfriend. Kung-Fu Master also had the hero chase down a kidnapped damsel in distress, as would two other very prolific arcade brawlers at the time: Double Dragon and Final Fight.[CR]Vigilante originally came out in the Arcades in 1988. It was closely followed by two console conversions: a Sega Master System port that made several concessions to the game for the sake of space, including changing some of the names, and a more faithful Turbografx-16 version in 1989. US Gold also published a version for several western home computers, while Korean company Clover handled the MSX home computer version. The Turbografx-16 version was also later rereleased on Nintendo's Wii Shop in all territories.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]On the main Screen, press and hold Up + Left + 1 + 2.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1988</releasedate>				<year>1989</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA Enterprises Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>2.9</rating>				<videoid>dAkTZ12XB8c</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3094</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588165-vigilante</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/vigilante</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/vigilante/3030-4146/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3094-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3094-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/26055-vigilante-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51955-vigilante-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51953-vigilante-sega-master-system-screenshot-your-mission-is-easy.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51954-vigilante-sega-master-system-screenshot-common-thugs-can-hold.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51956-vigilante-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-boss-of-the-first.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51957-vigilante-sega-master-system-screenshot-level-2-chasing-the.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51958-vigilante-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-ninja-boss-guarding.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51959-vigilante-sega-master-system-screenshot-bikers-chasing-you.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51960-vigilante-sega-master-system-screenshot-this-fatso-boss-needs.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51961-vigilante-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-final-stage-takes.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/51962-vigilante-sega-master-system-screenshot-this-suit-is-guarding.jpg</snapshot10>				<banner1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/graphical/3094-g.jpg</banner1>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/3094.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Virtua Fighter Animation (Brazil)">				<description>Virtua Fighter Animation (Brazil)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FVirtua%20Fighter%20Animation%20%28Brazil%29.zip" size="432593" />				<title_clean>Virtua Fighter Animation</title_clean>				<plot>Virtua Fighter Animation is an one-on-one 2D fighting game based on the Virtua Fighter anime series. It has two game modes: story and versus.[CR]In the story mode, the player follows the anime's plot, with anime style cutscenes before and after each fight. The story is divided in acts, each one of them corresponding to one fight. The player starts controlling Akira Yuki, as as he beats his opponents, each one of them joins his party, so they can be chosen in the next fights. Besides Akira, the other characters which become available are Pai Chan, Jacky Bryant, Wolf Hawkfield, Kage-Maru, Sarah Bryant and Lau Chan. In the final act, the player must fight against Dural.[CR]The versus mode allows players to choose any of the seven available characters to fight against the CPU. In the two player versus game, Kage-Maru is removed from the character selection.[CR]The Game Gear version has 3 different viewing modes: Normal, Large and Real-Time. The Normal viewing mode shows the fighters from a more distant position (smaller sprites) than the Large mode (larger sprites). The Real-Time mode simulates the zooming camera effects from the other Virtua Fighter games, alternating between the Normal and Large modes. It also has an extended intro sequence, with anime style cutscenes.[CR]In regards to gameplay, the game doesn't differ much from any other 2D fighting game, as the player can perform punches (button 1), kicks (button 2) and jumps (up), as well as some special maneuvers. The Game Gear version has also a block function (START button), absent in the Master System version. The fights are regular best of 3 round matches, and players will loose a round if one of this three possibilities happen: their energy is depleted, they fall out of the ring or they have less energy than the opponent if the time runs out.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1997</releasedate>				<year>1997</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>Tec Toy Indstria de Brinquedos S.A.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>2.5</rating>				<videoid>YQhO2lWJoTU</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3096</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/938746-virtua-fighter-animation</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/virtua-fighter-animation</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/virtua-fighter-animation/3030-14669/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3096-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3096-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/132817-virtua-fighter-animation-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214846-virtua-fighter-animation-sega-master-system-screenshot-intro.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214848-virtua-fighter-animation-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214849-virtua-fighter-animation-sega-master-system-screenshot-main.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214850-virtua-fighter-animation-sega-master-system-screenshot-options.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214851-virtua-fighter-animation-sega-master-system-screenshot-vs.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214852-virtua-fighter-animation-sega-master-system-screenshot-vs.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214853-virtua-fighter-animation-sega-master-system-screenshot-act.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214854-virtua-fighter-animation-sega-master-system-screenshot-act.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214855-virtua-fighter-animation-sega-master-system-screenshot-pay.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/214856-virtua-fighter-animation-sega-master-system-screenshot-akira.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Walter Payton Football (USA)">				<description>Walter Payton Football (USA)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FWalter%20Payton%20Football%20%28USA%29.zip" size="127416" />				<title_clean>Walter Payton Football</title_clean>				<plot>Walter Payton Football, or American Pro Football, as it is called in Japan and Europe, is a simulation of American football.

At the end of these rounds, the leader will come out of a building and will move side-to-side, occasionally shooting you if he has the chance.[CR]In the even-numbered stages (except stage six), you are required to ride across a desert, shooting gunslingers that ride past you. You can increase life by shooting the only gunslinger not on a horse and then detonating the bomb that is revealed. At the end of these levels, you will be faced with a challenging stage, where the object is to shoot as many targets as you can before time runs out.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Selection[CR]Firstly, you must shoot at the title screen.

For instance, the Freestyle Moguls is far more demanding on the SNES version than it is on the Genesis version.[CR]</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1994</releasedate>				<year>1994</year>				<studio>U.S. Gold Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1-4 Sim</nplayers>				<rating>4.2</rating>				<videoid>SStHS8sCM9A</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3104</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570269-winter-olympics-lillehammer-94</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/winter-olympics-lillehammer-94</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/winter-olympics-lillehammer-94/3030-8749/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/9/93770/2389654-genesis_winterolympicgameslillehammer94.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/46429-winter-olympics-lillehammer-94-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/46430-winter-olympics-lillehammer-94-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/187550-winter-olympics-lillehammer-94-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212723-winter-olympics-lillehammer-94-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212722-winter-olympics-lillehammer-94-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212724-winter-olympics-lillehammer-94-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212725-winter-olympics-lillehammer-94-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212726-winter-olympics-lillehammer-94-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212727-winter-olympics-lillehammer-94-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212728-winter-olympics-lillehammer-94-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212729-winter-olympics-lillehammer-94-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212730-winter-olympics-lillehammer-94-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/212731-winter-olympics-lillehammer-94-sega-master-system-screenshot.jpg</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Wolfchild (Europe)">				<description>Wolfchild (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FWolfchild%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="147340" />				<title_clean>Wolfchild</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wolfchild is a 2D shooter/platformer from British developers Core Design, which would later go on to create the Tomb Raider franchise. It features Saul Morrow, a man who is able to transform into a powerful werewolf form in order to fight the evil Chimera organization who kidnapped his scientist father Kal, from whom he received his powers. The game is a standard 2D platformer with shooting elements, and the player must collect energy before they can transform similar to Altered Beast.[CR]Wolfchild was originally released on the home computers Amiga and Atari ST, before being ported to various consoles like the Genesis, Master System, Mega-CD, SNES and Game Gear.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released Mike Weigand of Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the score of 5 out of 10. He wrote, "...It's got great graphics, and some of the sound effects are dynamite, but Wolfchild loses big in the gameplay department. The punching and other attacks are awkward. This was a new idea, and the levels are huge, but the overall game is dull and rather unappealing".[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter the password MARIO for a secret message as well as the ability to select your starting level.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1993</releasedate>				<year>1993</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>Virgin Games, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>2.2</rating>				<videoid>mqFPj1lvBdI</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3105</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588170-wolfchild</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/wolfchild</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/wolfchild/3030-8653/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3105-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3105-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164755-wolfchild-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/128990-wolfchild-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/128991-wolfchild-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-game-begins-level.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/128992-wolfchild-sega-master-system-screenshot-very-easy-opponents.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/128993-wolfchild-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-levelboss-of-the.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/128994-wolfchild-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-forest-level-2.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/2/23093/2640007-wolfchild001.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/8273/806491-1212759146_01.png</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/8273/806490-1212759146_00.png</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/8273/806489-1212759145_02.png</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/8273/806488-1212759145_01.png</snapshot10>			</game>			<game name="Wonder Boy (USA, Europe)">				<description>Wonder Boy (USA, Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FWonder%20Boy%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" size="77903" />				<title_clean>Wonder Boy</title_clean>				<plot>Just when things were going great with Tom-Tom and his girlfriend Tanya, some thug of a woodland king had to kidnap her and hide her away, and Tom-Tom doesn't have a clue where. That's why he has to explore deep dark forests, cross endless oceans, climb treacherous slopes, survive endless volcanoes, and even walk through clouds. But Tom-Tom will never be totally alone. You see, when he goes through the exotic locations, he has to come face to face with its inhabitants, like bees, spiders, snakes, coal-kids, frogs, bats, snails, coyotes, and octopuses, to name a few. The hatchet is Tom-Tom's only line of defense against these menaces.[CR]There are ten areas, each containing four rounds each, but the tenth area can't be accessed unless Tom-Tom collects all the dolls during his rescue mission. During his journey, he can break open different eggs that will reveal hatchets, skateboards, mushrooms, milk, and even guardian angels. You can ride the skateboard through each round, as long as you don't collide with an inhabitant. When you complete each round while still riding the skateboard, you'll start the next round still riding it. As you progress through each round, your vitality will start to get low, but it can be increased by getting milk, mushrooms, potato chips,or fruit that appear everywhere you go. As well as the normal eggs, there are also speckled eggs that must be avoided, otherwise the God of Death will be released, and once he follows you, you'll lose vitality much quickly. At the end of every fourth round, there is a king waiting to destroy you with his fireballs or lightning bolts.[CR]There are also warp-gates, but you don't find them, they find you. You see, warp-gates appear in rounds 1-4 of each area. If you happen to get one fruit, a special item will appear. These special items include handbags, wrist watches, a pair of shoes, a teddy bear, and a bottle of perfume. Another girl will appear and take you up to the clouds where the object is to collect as many hearts as you can without falling down or getting the item again. Once you have collected all the hearts, you can get the item to return to the surface, and more often than not, you'll get further in the round.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Level Select[CR]At the Screen that shows the Level and Stage number, press Button 1 twice, Button 2 twice, both buttons the Up to change the Level, and Right to change the Stage.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1987</releasedate>				<year>1987</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA of America, Inc.</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.2</rating>				<ESRB>E - Everyone</ESRB>				<videoid>Rj3cyTBTkSg</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3106</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588171-wonder-boy</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/wonder-boy</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/wonder-boy/3030-5220/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/8326</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3106-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3106-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/154252-wonder-boy-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/65122-wonder-boy-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/65123-wonder-boy-sega-master-system-screenshot-round-1-1.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/65124-wonder-boy-sega-master-system-screenshot-hitting-a-snail-with.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/65125-wonder-boy-sega-master-system-screenshot-tom-tom-is-taken-somewhere.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/65126-wonder-boy-sega-master-system-screenshot-to-the-bonus-round.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/65127-wonder-boy-sega-master-system-screenshot-a-boulder-approaches.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/65128-wonder-boy-sega-master-system-screenshot-protected-by-a-guardian.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/65129-wonder-boy-sega-master-system-screenshot-just-missed-the-doll.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/65130-wonder-boy-sega-master-system-screenshot-statistics.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/65131-wonder-boy-sega-master-system-screenshot-on-a-skateboard.jpg</snapshot10>				<fanart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/fanart/original/3106-1.jpg</fanart1>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/d9bXGsG.jpg</banner1>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/3106.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="Wonder Boy III - The Dragon's Trap (USA, Europe)">				<description>Wonder Boy III - The Dragon's Trap (USA, Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FWonder%20Boy%20III%20-%20The%20Dragon%27s%20Trap%20%28USA%2C%20Europe%29.zip" size="139331" />				<title_clean>Wonder Boy III - The Dragon's Trap</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap is a platformer for the Sega Master System, Game Gear and TurboGrafx-16 and part of Westone's Wonder Boy series. It is the first Wonder Boy game not to be developed originally for the Arcades, as it was specially made for Sega's Master System console. Like many Wonder Boy games, however, it was eventually ported by Hudson to the TurboGrafx-16 with a different name to avoid copyright violations.[CR]The game begins with the player infiltrating a castle and defeating its boss, a menacing dragon. Upon killing the dragon it unleashes a curse, transforming the player into a green lizard. After this short introduction, the game opens up into a vast, explorable world. To regain Wonder Boy's human form, the player must explore this open world, and kill all of the dragon bosses protecting each dungeon. Killing a boss rids Wonder Boy of his current animal form, while transforming him into another. The gameplay is reminiscent of Metroid, and could be considered an early Metroidvania.[CR]Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap was originally released in Europe and the US on the Master System in 1989. Japan never received this version, as Master System development had already ceased in light of the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis). They, as well as the US and Europe, did eventually receive the Game Gear port in 1992. The TurboGrafx-16/PC Engine version was released in 1991.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game's hub world, a small village complete with shops and a save point, gives the player access to all the world's main areas. At first, most of the world's pathways are blocked off but they become open to once the various animal forms and their associated abilities have been gained. The player is not allowed to change forms at will, meaning that the while the game's world is in the Metroid vein, progress largely becomes a linear task due to the limits of each animal form. However, later in the game special transformation rooms become available which allow the player to shift between all previously-earned forms.[CR]The various forms (and their inherent abilities) Wonder Boy goes through during the game are:Lizard-Man (fire breath, cannot wield weapons)Mouse-Man (small size, wall walk)Piranha-Man (swimming)Lion-Man (tall sword arc)Hawk-Man (flight)Hu-Man (no special abilities)[CR]Each new area of the world follows the same basic pattern: Wonder Boy begins by making his way to the dragon's lair, fighting enemies and using his newly acquired abilities to progress. Eventually the player reaches the dragon's dungeon. Once the player makes his/her way through that, they are met with a boss encounter in an enclosed space. Typically the key to defeating each boss is timed jumps and sword attacks. Dragon bosses include;Meka-Dragon (robot, final boss of Wonder Boy in Monster Land)Mummy DragonDragon ZombieCaptain DragonDaimyo DragonVampire Dragon[CR]The game features an inventory system and an equipment upgrade system, as well as loot drops in the form of money or luck gems.[CR]Additional Notes[CR]Wonder Boy III: The Dragon's Trap shares its Roman numerical title with Wonder Boy III: Monster Lair, an arcade game with a Mega Drive port, adding to the confusing Wonder Boy series timeline.The TurboGrafx-16 version is named Dragon's Curse and drops the Wonder Boy name. This has been standard practice for Hudson's previous ports of the Wonder Boy series: the first (Wonder Boy) was transformed into Adventure Island, and the second (Wonder Boy in Monster Land) was transformed into Bikkuriman World.Dragon's Trap is also considered to be the second game in the Monster World sub-franchise. The Japanese name for the Game Gear version is called Monster World II: Dragon's Trap.The cheat code WE5T 0NE (after the game's developer) allows the player to play in human form outside of the intro.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] All armour/equipment &amp; forms[CR]Entering the following will allow you to begin the game with all swords/equipment and all forms unlocked.

Normally you would fall through the invisible gap in the floor next to the fire-breathing stone head, but there is a ledge underneath the head which seems to lead to a dead end. Jump over the gap and land on that ledge. You will find that you can pass through the wall in front of you and you will enter a room with a chest! The chest contains 5 coins, 1 money bag, 1 large heart and 1 medicine. This is useful for preparing you before you fight the Mummy Dragon. You will automatically be dropped through the invisible floor gap upon exiting the room. [CR]As Mouseman - once you have travelled through the open forests where the fire dropping smogs chased you, you will enter a screen containing a mouse-block maze. If you look carefully, there are three paths leading through the maze and opening up to the next screen. Taking the middle path will continue your journey, but before you do, travel to the very top-left corner of the screen via the highest path. If you attempt to jump forward into that corner of the screen, you will jump into a secret treasure room! The chest contains 1 coin, seven money bags and 3 little hearts. The money will be useful if you haven't enough to purchase the Shogun items in the next shop. When you exit the room, you will be automatically be dropped outside the mouseblock maze.

Future Wonder Boy games (the series would eventually be rebranded Monster World) would retain the RPG elements, while the platforming aspect would continue in the Wonder Boy "spin-off" series Adventure Island.[CR]The goal of the game is to move Wonder Boy across the world, fighting monsters and collecting money and using that money to purchase upgrades to armor and weapons. Wonder Boy must face a significant number of bosses as well, each with varying attack patterns. Though careful platforming is a necessity, exploration and backtracking are also occasionally required if the player wishes to reach the end of the game.[CR]The game was released in the Arcades initially by Sega in 1987, eventually moving to their Sega Master System the following year. It was also published by Activision for many Western home computers like the Amiga, C64 and ZX Spectrum a year after that in 1989. Since then it has been rereleased several more times, first as a 2005 mobile game, then a 2008/9 Virtual Console port for the Wii (using the Sega Master System version) and most recently in 2012 as part of a compilation of Monster World games available for PSN, XBLA and Virtual Console.[CR]Additionally, the game received at least three major graphical overhauls which were released under different names. The first was a PC Engine port the same year as its Arcade release, renamed Bikkuriman World and published by Hudson Soft. Jaleco ported the game with Journey to the West graphics as Saiyuki World for the NES. Finally, the Brazilian version of the Sega Master System changed the graphics to resemble a Brazilian comic named Monica's Gang.

Future Wonder Boy games (the series would eventually be rebranded Monster World) would retain the RPG elements, while the platforming aspect would continue in the Wonder Boy "spin-off" series Adventure Island.[CR]The goal of the game is to move Wonder Boy across the world, fighting monsters and collecting money and using that money to purchase upgrades to armor and weapons. Wonder Boy must face a significant number of bosses as well, each with varying attack patterns. Though careful platforming is a necessity, exploration and backtracking are also occasionally required if the player wishes to reach the end of the game.[CR]The game was released in the Arcades initially by Sega in 1987, eventually moving to their Sega Master System the following year. It was also published by Activision for many Western home computers like the Amiga, C64 and ZX Spectrum a year after that in 1989. Since then it has been rereleased several more times, first as a 2005 mobile game, then a 2008/9 Virtual Console port for the Wii (using the Sega Master System version) and most recently in 2012 as part of a compilation of Monster World games available for PSN, XBLA and Virtual Console.[CR]Additionally, the game received at least three major graphical overhauls which were released under different names. The first was a PC Engine port the same year as its Arcade release, renamed Bikkuriman World and published by Hudson Soft. Jaleco ported the game with Journey to the West graphics as Saiyuki World for the NES. Finally, the Brazilian version of the Sega Master System changed the graphics to resemble a Brazilian comic named Monica's Gang. Excepting the graphical switch, each version is functionally identical to the original.[CR]Turbografx-16/PC-Engine Version[CR]Wonder Boy in Monster Land was ported to the PC Engine system as one of its two launch titles, though it received a new title - Bikkuriman World - and an entirely new set of sprites to become part of the Bikkuriman license.[CR]Bikkuriman was originally a series of collectible stickers that were included with a sweet confection, sort of like the Japanese equivalent of the US's Bazooka Joe.

Quips like "No doubt about it, he's deep in the sandtrap", "Straight onto the fairway", and "Looks like he hit the tree, Jim." are used to provide running commentary on the gameplay.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1991</releasedate>				<year>1991</year>				<studio>U.S. Gold Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1-4 Sim</nplayers>				<rating>2.8</rating>				<videoid>aKatceF_OpQ</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3113</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/570238-world-class-leaderboard-golf</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/world-class-leader-board</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/world-class-leader-board/3030-9947/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3113-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3113-1.jpg</boxart2>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213221-world-class-leader-board-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213222-world-class-leader-board-sega-master-system-screenshot-practicing.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213223-world-class-leader-board-sega-master-system-screenshot-the.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213224-world-class-leader-board-sega-master-system-screenshot-overview.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213225-world-class-leader-board-sega-master-system-screenshot-gauntlet.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213226-world-class-leader-board-sega-master-system-screenshot-doral.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/7/2/a/gfs_91728_2_1.jpg</snapshot7>			</game>			<game name="World Cup Italia '90 (Europe)">				<description>World Cup Italia '90 (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FWorld%20Cup%20Italia%20%2790%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="67923" />				<title_clean>World Cup Italia '90</title_clean>				<plot>This soccer game lets you choose a team representing one of twenty-four countries around the world to participate in the World Championship tournament.

It is based on and licensed by the 1994 FIFA World Cup tournament, which was staged in nine cities across the United States of America. The 1994 World Cup mascot, a brown soccer-playing dog named Striker, features heavily in the game's menus and box art. The game was released on almost every home computer and console active in 1994. This would be the last officially produced FIFA World Cup game, as World Cup tournaments would be folded into EA Sports's annualized FIFA Soccer games.[CR]The Super Nintendo version of World Cup USA 94 features all 24 qualifying teams for the 1994 World Cup and eight additional teams that did not qualify (including England, Scotland, France, Japan and other countries that traditionally buy a lot of soccer games). Non-qualifying teams are marked with an asterisk (*). Other versions had different assortments of non-qualifying teams, including Canada, Austria, Uruguay and the former nation of Czechoslovakia.USAGermanyMexicoGreeceRussiaColombiaBrazilBoliviaSwitzerlandItalyNorwayEngland*Republic of Ireland (Eire)Scotland*Denmark*BelgiumRomaniaSwedenFrance*MoroccoCameroonArgentinaJapan*South KoreaPortugal*Netherlands (Holland)SpainWales*NigeriaSaudi ArabiaAustralia*Bulgaria[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Passwords[CR]The following passwords allow you to play at any stage of the world cup with Germany:</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1994</releasedate>				<year>1994</year>				<genre>Action, Sports</genre>				<studio>U.S. Gold Ltd.</studio>				<nplayers>1-2 Sim</nplayers>				<perspective>Top-Down</perspective>				<videoid>Qj-rNTHsJ9Q</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3116</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/938727-world-cup-usa-94</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/world-cup-usa-94</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/world-cup-usa-94/3030-5498/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3116-2.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/142781-world-cup-usa-94-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/142782-world-cup-usa-94-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213230-world-cup-usa-94-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213227-world-cup-usa-94-sega-master-system-screenshot-short-intro.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213228-world-cup-usa-94-sega-master-system-screenshot-select-your.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213229-world-cup-usa-94-sega-master-system-screenshot-main-menu-try.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213231-world-cup-usa-94-sega-master-system-screenshot-team-roster.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213232-world-cup-usa-94-sega-master-system-screenshot-kick-off.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213233-world-cup-usa-94-sega-master-system-screenshot-it-s-a-dangerous.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213234-world-cup-usa-94-sega-master-system-screenshot-goal.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213235-world-cup-usa-94-sega-master-system-screenshot-hey-that-was.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/213236-world-cup-usa-94-sega-master-system-screenshot-nice-animations.jpg</snapshot10>				<clearlogo1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/clearlogo/3116.png</clearlogo1>			</game>			<game name="World Games (Europe)">				<description>World Games (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FWorld%20Games%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="82221" />				<title_clean>World Games</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]World Games was developed in 1986 by  Epyx for a wide range of systems including the Commodore 64, Apple II, and the Sega Master System.

This will bring you to an options menu that will allow you to change the view from 3-D to 2-D (useful for those that don't have 3-D glasses), and to invert up/down controls.</plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1987</releasedate>				<year>1987</year>				<genre>Action</genre>				<studio>SEGA Corporation</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.3</rating>				<videoid>YPcpb69sTGA</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3124</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588175-zaxxon-3-d</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/zaxxon-3-d</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/zaxxon-3-d/3030-1728/</giantbomb_url>				<boxart1>http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_large/0/5150/1209025-tumblr_ku70lhoszm1qzurbto1_500.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/154237-zaxxon-3-d-sega-master-system-back-cover.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/154238-zaxxon-3-d-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/157950-zaxxon-3-d-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/147224-zaxxon-3-d-sega-master-system-screenshot-title-screen.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/147225-zaxxon-3-d-sega-master-system-screenshot-flying-through-space.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/147226-zaxxon-3-d-sega-master-system-screenshot-you-re-blown-up.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/147229-zaxxon-3-d-sega-master-system-screenshot-flying-through-a.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/147227-zaxxon-3-d-sega-master-system-screenshot-game-over.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/f/2/d/gfs_57385_2_1.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/5/f/d/gfs_57385_2_2.jpg</snapshot7>			</game>			<game name="Zillion (Japan, Europe) (En,Ja)">				<description>Zillion (Japan, Europe) (En,Ja)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FZillion%20%28Japan%2C%20Europe%29%20%28En%2CJa%29.zip" size="76753" />				<title_clean>Zillion</title_clean>				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Zillion is an action/adventure game released for the Sega Master System, based on the Anime series of the same name. The protagonist, JJ, is on a mission to retrieve five floppy discs from the possession of the Norsa Forces on Planet X. The game begins with JJ landing on the planet's surface in a spacecraft, where he uses an underground access hatch to enter the Norsa Forces base. The entirety of the game is contained within the underground base as well as the small area of the planet surface directly above the base.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Zillion is a side-scrolling adventure game, most similar in execution to the original Metroid, assuming many of that games conventions such as locked rooms, boss fights and a labyrinthine underground maze that players must traverse. Like Samus, JJ carries a gun, though his is a more traditional hand-pistol. Upgrades to the laser, to speed and jump height, and to health happen throughout the game.[CR]JJ also has secondary mission objectives, that of rescuing his captured partners Apple and Champ, both of whom are being held prisoner in the underground base and to enter a code into the Norsa Forces main computer initiative the self-destruct mechanism. To achieve these goals, JJ must navigate through the base, avoiding tripwires, containment fields, automated turrets, land mines, and Norsa Forces security guards. Access to many rooms are initially blocked, and JJ can only open them by accessing computer kiosks in other rooms to gather codes to open doors. Upon rescuing his partners, the player can then opt to play as them. Both Apple and Champ offer different speed and strength than JJ, allowing them to access different areas of the map.[CR]The underground base consists of individual rooms that are one screen in size and scroll only when you move to a new room, coupled with the occasional freely scrolling hallway. Zillion was notable for featuring an in-game map that gave your present location within a grid, each cell of which represents a room in the base. However, the map did not show how the rooms connected, so the player was still required to familiarize himself with the base layout in order to efficiently navigate the base. Gamers were often forced to make custom maps when playing Zillion and for good reason. Not only was the game hard to navigate by design but there was also a innocent looking room that was a game ending trap. Upon the player entering the room and walking past a certain point the player could never exit and would have to start the game from the beginning. It was debated by fans of the game if this was truly by design or if it was a large oversight on the part of the development team. The player encounters the room about half way through the game and if they are paying attention when entering they will know not to continue on into it.[CR]Release[CR]Zillion was released in 1987 in the US, timed to coincide with the anime that inspired it. A sequel, Zillion II was released in 1988. Sega also took the game's gun as a model for its release of the Sega Master System Light Phaser.[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Continues[CR]Everytime your killed, press 1, 2, Up.

Sent from a distant outpost at the extreme edge of the Planetary System, the garbled message told of a new, gigantic Norsa Battle Fortress at the edge of the Norsa Galaxy.[CR]Apple and Champ, two members of the elite White Knight special peacekeeping force, immediately set out on a reconnaissance mission to investigate the Norsa Fortress.[CR]The last words which anybody heard from Apple and Champ were: "Help us J.J.! Baron Ricks has..."[CR]There are eight rounds in the game, and the gameplay is split into two parts. In the odd-numbered rounds, you ride a bike known as the "Tri Formation" which has the Zillion laser beam attached to it. As well as shooting Norsa warriors, you must jump over gaps and the pulsating areas of the floor. If your character comes in contact with their shots, or rides over the pulsating areas of the floor, your life meter will decrease. If that meter is empty, you lose a life. Power-ups can be obtained that will give you the Armorator or extra life. In Rounds 5 and 7, you are required to use the Armorator to survive the round. You can also change between Apple and Champ during these rounds, but only once each.[CR]And on the even-numbered rounds, you run-and-shoot your way to a boss. Beware of the Norsa Warriors and other enemies. The same rules apply to those of the odd-numbered rounds, where being shot at or fall in a gap will result in you losing a life.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/zillion-2-tri-formation[CR][B]Cheat:[/B] Extra Continues[CR]When the ''Game Over'' screen appears, hit Up + 1 to get three more continues. </plot>				<releasedate>9/1/1987</releasedate>				<year>1987</year>				<genre>Platform</genre>				<studio>SEGA</studio>				<nplayers>1</nplayers>				<perspective>3rd-Person</perspective>				<rating>3.7</rating>				<videoid>VGnkhcmZvRw</videoid>				<thegamesdb_id>3126</thegamesdb_id>				<gamefaqs_url>http://www.gamefaqs.com/sms/588177-zillion-ii-the-tri-formation</gamefaqs_url>				<mobygames_url>http://www.mobygames.com/game/sega-master-system/zillion-2-tri-formation</mobygames_url>				<giantbomb_url>http://www.giantbomb.com/zillion-ii-tri-formation/3030-19742/</giantbomb_url>				<consolegrid_url>http://consolegrid.com/games/10777</consolegrid_url>				<boxart1>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/front/3126-1.jpg</boxart1>				<boxart2>http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/original/back/3126-1.jpg</boxart2>				<boxart3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/164407-zillion-2-tri-formation-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart3>				<boxart4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/202093-zillion-2-tri-formation-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart4>				<boxart5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/covers/l/301054-zillion-2-tri-formation-sega-master-system-media.jpg</boxart5>				<snapshot1>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/75975-zillion-2-tri-formation-sega-master-system-screenshot-title.jpg</snapshot1>				<snapshot2>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/75976-zillion-2-tri-formation-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-get.jpg</snapshot2>				<snapshot3>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/75977-zillion-2-tri-formation-sega-master-system-screenshot-round.jpg</snapshot3>				<snapshot4>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/75978-zillion-2-tri-formation-sega-master-system-screenshot-noza.jpg</snapshot4>				<snapshot5>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/75979-zillion-2-tri-formation-sega-master-system-screenshot-an-unidentified.jpg</snapshot5>				<snapshot6>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/75980-zillion-2-tri-formation-sega-master-system-screenshot-jumping.jpg</snapshot6>				<snapshot7>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/75981-zillion-2-tri-formation-sega-master-system-screenshot-avoid.jpg</snapshot7>				<snapshot8>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/75982-zillion-2-tri-formation-sega-master-system-screenshot-the-round.jpg</snapshot8>				<snapshot9>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/75983-zillion-2-tri-formation-sega-master-system-screenshot-round.jpg</snapshot9>				<snapshot10>http://www.mobygames.com/images/shots/l/75984-zillion-2-tri-formation-sega-master-system-screenshot-using.jpg</snapshot10>				<banner1>http://i.imgur.com/w4y2UMw.png</banner1>			</game>			<game name="Zool - Ninja of the 'Nth' Dimension (Europe)">				<description>Zool - Ninja of the 'Nth' Dimension (Europe)</description>				<rom name="No-Intro-Collection_2015-03-03/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III.zip/Sega%20-%20Master%20System%20-%20Mark%20III%2FZool%20-%20Ninja%20of%20the%20%27Nth%27%20Dimension%20%28Europe%29.zip" size="139697" />				<title_clean>Zool - Ninja of the 'Nth' Dimension</title_clean>				<plot>His name is Zool.
