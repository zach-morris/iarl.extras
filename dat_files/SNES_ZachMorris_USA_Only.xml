			<emu_comment>No Intro SNES List by Zach Morris.  This is a filtered list of the default SNES archive, listing only games from the USA.[CR]The Super Nintendo Entertainment System (also known as the Super NES, SNES or Super Nintendo) is a 16-bit video game console that was released by Nintendo in North America, Europe, Australasia (Oceania), and South America between 1990 and 1993. In Japan and Southeast Asia, the system is called the Super Famicom (officially adopting the abbreviated name of its predecessor, the Family Computer), or SFC for short. In South Korea, it is known as the Super Comboy and was distributed by Hyundai Electronics. Although each version is essentially the same, several forms of regional lockout prevent the different versions from being compatible with one another. The Super Nintendo Entertainment System was Nintendo's second home console, following the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The console introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other consoles at the time. Additionally, development of a variety of enhancement chips (which were integrated on game circuit boards) helped to keep it competitive in the marketplace. The SNES was a global success, becoming the best-selling console of the 16-bit era despite its relatively late start and the fierce competition it faced in North America and Europe from Sega's Genesis console. The SNES remained popular well into the 32-bit era, and although Nintendo no longer offers factory repairs/replacement or accessories for the console, it continues to be popular among fans, collectors, retro gamers, and emulation enthusiasts, some of whom are still making homebrew ROM images.[CR]Developer:  Nintendo[CR]Manufacturer:  Nintendo[CR]CPU:  16-bit 65c816 Ricoh 5A22 3.58 MHz[CR]Memory:  128kb[CR]Graphics:  N/A[CR]Sound:  8-bit Sony SPC700[CR]Display:  512 Ã— 239[CR]Media:  Cartridge[CR]Max.

				<plot>Conventional baseball no longer exists in the year 2020. The 'Super Baseball Association' has been very profitable over the years with robotics power players up against the strongest of athletes. Due to the secret manipulation of certain robotics team players, abilities have been computer controlled to decide the outcome of certain games, benefiting the SBA. Die hard players discovered the SBA's cheating and have now disconnected several parts of the computers to achieve fair and challenging play. Now the games may continue in the famed 'Cyber-Egg' Stadium where only power and skill will determine the winner!</plot>

				<title_clean>3 Ninjas Kick Back</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]3 Ninjas Kick Back is a 1994 action-platformer game for the Super Nintendo,  Sega Genesis and Sega CD. The player, as either Rocky (the green-garbed older brother, who uses a staff in-game), Colt (the blue-garbed middle brother, who uses a sword in-game) or Tum Tum (the yellow-garbed youngest brother, who uses a pair of sais), must make their way through a series of levels using their speed, reflexes and ninja skills.[CR]The game emphasizes climbing as a mechanic, allowing the player character to hold onto branches and swinging vines by holding up while jumping. From these vantage points, the player can progress in the stage or find hidden bonuses.[CR]3 Ninjas Kick Back is based on the 1994 movie of the same name, which was the second 3 Ninjas movie to be released. The plot concerns the theft of a dagger that was awarded to the trio's grandfather, Mori, for winning a tournament in Japan 50 years ago. The trio eventually head to Japan to track it down, fighting the goons of Koga (an embittered runner-up in the tournament) along the way.[CR]The Sega CD version of the game was bundled together with the 1992 SNES/Genesis licensed platformer Hook, which was also based on a family movie distributed by TriStar Pictures.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>7th Saga, The</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The 7th Saga is an RPG published by Enix in 1993 for the SNES, released in its native Japan as Elnard. Despite being a fairly straightforward RPG, the 7th Saga included a few unique twists that set it slightly apart from the crowd. First, the game provides the player with an opportunity to choose between seven different characters at the beginning, each with their own backstory and playstyle. Next, one of the core gameplay mechanics is that the other characters the player didn't choose are on the same quest, and the player can try to recruit them to their team (only one companion at a time however) or fight them for their runes. The 7th Saga is also one of the first RPGs to show enemies on the minimap, and is famous for its near impossible difficulty.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Each of the characters listed below are available at the onset of the game, and will continue to play a vital role in the story (some more so than others). When choosing a companion character, it is good to balance their strengths with the player character's weaknesses.Wilme PelinWilme in Battle[CR]An alien of unknown origins but apparently on a quest for the power the runes can provide, Wilme specializes in fire magic and other fire-based attacks. He has high HP but can equip only certain items.Lux TizerLux Fighting Pison[CR]A robot from an ancient civilization, he is a physical powerhouse but remains incredibly polite. Much like Wilme he can only equip certain items, and is magically deficient. What he lacks in magic though he makes up for in pure defense and power.Esuna BusyEsuna Casting a Spell[CR]The Yin to Lux's Yang, Esuna is an elf and one of the most damaging magic users in the game. While weak physically, she gets access to the most powerful spells in the game and can be a force to be reckoned with.Lejes RimulLejes fighting Pison[CR]Lejes, a demon bent on ruling the world, would be an otherwise unique and interesting character were he not already teamed up with and alien and a robot. Strong physically and magically Lejes is an absolute glass cannon when the going gets tough, and has a very low defense.Valsu SaizerValsu in Battle[CR]The quintessential priest of the game, Valsu eventually becomes a walking hospital. One of his strongest magic spells is ELIXIR which fully heals a characters HP and MP, providing Valsu and his companion with a near infinite supply of health and magic to do their work. Just make sure he lives long enough to get that far.Kamil DowonnaKamil Battling a Lesser Enemy[CR]The standard Human knight, Kamil is one of the most balanced characters in the game. He enjoys good HP/MP, and good attack and defense. Well-rounded and doesn't excel in any particular categories. A good all-around character.Olvan JaessOlvan Leveling Up[CR]The stout dwarf of the cast, Olvan has a good balance of physical and magical strength like Kamil, but much rather prefers to hit things as hard as he can rather than cast magic spells at them. Another well-rounded choice.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]7th Saga is set in a world that is called Ticondera. The game starts with King Lemele sending out the seven apprentices to collect the seven runes of power. Each rune has extreme power and is a part of the religious myths of Ticondera. The basic myth is that 5000 years before the game, Saro defeated a mythic evil named Gorsia with the help of the seven runes. The apprentice that collects all seven is promised to become Lemele&#8217;s heir to the throne.[CR]After picking one of the seven apprentices, which are the previously listed playable characters, the player sets out to start collecting the runes. While searching for the seven runes, the player will come across typical RPG scenarios. There is a cool added element, in which, one of the apprentices betrays the others and hires Pison, a bounty hunter with a whip, to kill the others (the traitor is randomized in each game).[CR]After collecting all seven runes, the player must face the mythic being named Gorsia. However shortly after this battle there is a plot twist and the final act begins. The player character undergoes some time traveling and must find a way to save the world before it's too late.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Infinite Stat Boosts (Lux)[CR]In the past, with Lux in the party, he is able to get stat boosts for 30 HP, 30 MP, and 20 of the remaining stats. While this cutscene occurs, you can walk four steps. During those steps, if you walk out of bounds (like through a doorway) as the dialogue box appears, you will get the named stat boost. Here in particular, you want to walk right to the wall, let go of Right briefly, and then press it again quickly. By doing this, you can still get another stat boost, with the previous one having already taken effect![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Defeat Romus in 1 turn.[CR]First let Romus kill you, then back in Rablesk and find a man with an upset wife. He will give you a Whistle. Go back to Romus and right at your first turn use the Whistle and he dies instantly. Just remember if using this tip it will cost you half your gold.</plot>

				<title_clean>A.S.P. - Air Strike Patrol</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A.S.P. Air Strike Patrol (Desert Fighter in Europe and Japan) is an isometric jet fighter game superficially similar to EA's Strike series. The player must choose a load-out for their fighter jet and has a series of mission critical targets to find and destroy, but they can also explore the large maps for additional goals, fuel and ammo permitting.[CR]The game was originally published in Japan by SETA Corporation in early 1994. It would be released in Europe later the same year by System 3, and then in the US the following year.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]A.S.P. takes place in a fictionalized version of the Gulf War of the early 90s. The player is a UN jet fighter pilot, a member of the eponymous Air Strike Patrol, who is assigned various missions in areas around a fictitious Middle Eastern country named Zaraq. The ultimate goal is to oust Zaraq's dictator, who is later revealed to be working with some unconventional outside help.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players are expected to outfit their craft before sorties (mission attempts), using upgrades they've acquired to equip one of two real jet fighters: The  F-15 and the  A-10. After reviewing the mission report and selecting an entry point, the player begins their sortie.[CR]Sorties play similarly to the Strike games: The player controls a jet plane flying a few hundred meters from the ground in an isometric landscape. Their fuel and ammo is limited and they must destroy as much of the mission targets (while also observing secondary missions, such as limiting civilian casualties and property damage) before they must leave the mission area to refuel. Targets appear on a mini-map, and each destination (RADAR bases, chemical weapons factories, etc.) have several buildings which count towards its destruction percentage. Usually hitting a certain target percentage is all that's necessary for mission completion, though occasionally this target is 100% and the player must be careful to eliminate every element on every base.[CR]After a sortie, the player is rated on how effective they were, including speed, accuracy and damage caused to the enemy (including non-mission targets) and are penalized if they let their jet get destroyed (which happens at zero fuel or zero health) or if they eliminated any friendly units, which tend to have brighter/greener coloration, or Zaraq civilians. The player then starts the process over with the next sortie, until the mission target has been reached. Most missions have multiple areas the player must visit for their mission goal, and may only visit one per sortie.[CR]Each region has a finite amount of resources, including enemy troops. Players can use the map to see how many enemy units are left on the map: If the player has remaining fuel and no more mission targets during a sortie, they may decide to chase these enemies down. These are generally non-crucial to missions, but may enhance the player's final score.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra Missles and Fuel[CR]Pause the game with controller 1 and then enter the following code on controller 2: A - B - A - B - Select - A. Then you should get more missiles and fuel.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra Missles and Fuel[CR]First choose the A-10 as your plane.  Wait for the Good Luck message to disappear from the screen, shoot your 30mm cannon one time, then hold down the X button.  Keep it held down and the message, ''Super A-10'' will appear on the screen to confirm that the cheat worked.  Now your weapon will be much more powerful.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]ABC Monday Night Football is a professional football game from Data East. The game uses a vertical perspective of the field, placing the goals on the far and near sides of the screen. The SNES version used Mode 7 to display a sense of depth, but the original versions would simply scroll the screen as the ball moved up or down the field. The game is licensed by ABC to use its namesake program, but not by the NFL or NFLPA; subsequently, all the teams have fake names.[CR]The game was originally released for home computers, appearing on the Amiga, PC and Commodore 64. A SNES port developed by Kuusou Kagaku came a few years later with some graphical enhancements.[CR]The game was followed by ABC Wide World of Sports Boxing, another sports game licensed by ABC and produced by Data East.

				<title_clean>ActRaiser</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The title screen of the Super Nintendo version[CR]ActRaiser is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System city-building simulation and action hybrid. The game was developed by Quintet and published by Enix (before their merge with Square), and the game was released during November of 1991. Although there was a sequel for the game, ActRaiser 2, it completely abandoned the simulation aspects of the original, which caused many fans to dislike it.[CR]ActRaiser was also released in 2007 on the Wii Virtual Console in Europe, North America, and Japan. European mobile phones got a version of the game with a 2004 release as well. The game was also part of the Nintendo Super System, an arcade system that allowed gamers to preview upcoming releases.[CR]ActRaiser is a relatively well-received game. It was accepted into GameSpot's Greatest Games of All Time in 2003 and was rated the 150th best game on a Nintendo system by Nintendo Power.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Not much of a plot exists in the actual game itself in ActRaiser. However, much is explained via the instruction booklet. The instruction booklet states that Tanzra and his six guardians attacked the Master. The Master was injured after the long battle, so he retreated to his sky palace and proceeded to fall into a deep sleep.[CR]While the Master was sleeping, Tanzra drove the world into ruins. He divided the world into six lands with each being ruled by one of the guardians. When the Master awakes, fully rejuvenated, he is ready to free the world from the oppression of Tanzra.[CR]After defeating Tanzra, civilizations begin to stop worshiping the Master with many losing faith in him and turning to other things. The servant notes this, and says that people only appear to pray and trust to the Master in times of trouble.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In ActRaiser, the player takes control of an incredibly powerful being known only as the Master. The Master has been awakened from a deep sleep to find the world in ruin. He and his loyal servant (a small angelic creature) then set out to rebuild civilization.The Master takes the form of a warrior; here he is battling a boss[CR]To begin this rebuilding process, the Master positions his sky palace above an area filled with enemies and demons. Then, the Master takes on the form of a strong warrior wielding a large sword. In these side-scrolling areas, the warrior uses his sword to dispatch many hazards, such as environmental hazards or monsters. The warrior can pick up power-ups by destroying statues situated in certain places around the level. The power-ups have a variety of effects, from healing the warrior, to bonus points. After defeating the boss of the level, the warrior moves onto the next section of the city-building portion.[CR]The life bar that the Master has in his warrior form can also be extended as the Master gains levels. Leveling up is done through an experience system, in which the combined population of the Master's rebuilt towns amasses into experience. Also gained in leveling up is more SP, which can then be used to preform miraculous events in the city-building part of the game. Magical spells can also be granted to the Master through his followers that he can use in his warrior form. These spells deal significantly more damage than regular attacks, making them essential to the completion of the game.[CR]In the city-building portion of the game, the player takes control of the Master's servant, a small cupid-like creature. Each town begins with only two humans, who then follow the Master's commands and aid him in rebuilding his world. They must be guided (the direction they are guided in is where they will build), and in turn will build houses, roads, and farms. The villagers eventually gain use of other skills, such as composing music or creating bridges.Building a city[CR]The Master also has the use of several magical powers in the city-building portion. He can summon lightning, rain, sun, wind, or earthquakes. Using these abilities, trees, rocks, snow, monsters, and much more can be cleared. In a few sections of the game, the abilities must be used to assist the villagers, starting windmills or putting out fires, for example.[CR]However, the city-building isn't calm. There are several Monster Lairs scattered around the map. Monsters are spawned out of these lairs. The people have the ability to seal these lairs, making it a necessity to guide the population to the lairs. The cupid can attack the monsters using his arrows, but once he loses all of his life, he cannot attack until the people increase in population. Once all of the Monster Lairs are sealed, the people can gain even more advanced technology and techniques.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Symphonic Suite from ActRasier[CR]The critically acclaimed 16-bit soundtrack was composed by Yuzo Koshiro. Brad Shoemaker described it as:[CR]Orchestral video game soundtracks are the norm these days, but back then, the realistic instrument samples really brought out the beauty of Koshiro's aural backdrop. Even though it was a first-generation SNES game, ActRaiser's score remains one of the finest on the system[CR]On Sep. 21, 1991, Koshiro released a 'Symphonic Suite From ActRaiser' CD that used a full orchestral arrangement for the soundtrack. It contained the following 10 tracks:[CR]#[CR]Track Name[CR]Duration (30:40)[CR]1[CR]Opening ~ Tenkujo ~ Blood Pool ~ Casandora[CR]4:20[CR]2[CR]Intermezzo I[CR]0:18[CR]3[CR]Filmoa[CR]2:53[CR]4[CR]Intermezzo II[CR]0:31[CR]5[CR]Aitos ~ Temple ~ Korin ~ Sekaiju[CR]5:19[CR]6[CR]Intermezzo III[CR]0:20[CR]7[CR]Pyramid ~ Marana ~ Seijyaku ~ North Wall[CR]5:56[CR]8[CR]Hitobito no Tanjyo ~ Sasagemono[CR]3:06[CR]9[CR]Maju Arawaro ~ Kyoteki ~ Satan[CR]3:18[CR]10[CR]Heiwa na Sekai ~ Ending[CR]4:39[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hidden Extra Lives[CR]Here is how to find four hidden extra lives in the game's towns: [CR]Fillmore - When you get the Compass, use it here.

				<title_clean>ActRaiser 2</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]ActRaiser 2 is the follow-up to Quintet's earlier SNES game ActRaiser. It strips out much of the God sim aspects, building towns and helping control the monster population from a top-down view. Instead, it doubles down on the first game's "action stages": platforming sequences in which an avatar of the player's character (called only "The Master") fights his way through a dungeon to defeat one of Tanzra's lieutenants.[CR]As with the first game, ActRaiser 2 was released in all three regions. It was published by Enix in the US and Japan, and by Ubisoft in Europe. In Japan the game has the subtitle "Chinmoku e no Seisen", which roughly means "The Crusade for Silence".[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]There is some discussion as to when this entry takes place in the ActRaiser time line. The opening intro sequence seems to be a retelling of the very end of the original ActRaiser, using the newer character sprite for The Master but the older sprite for series antagonist Tanzra. This would place ActRaiser 2 chronologically after the first game.[CR]As the game opens, The Master's servant angels inform him that the evil Tanzra has been awoken by his evil minions, who have manifested as representations of the classical seven deadly sins: Greed, Sloth, Envy, Wrath, Pride, Lust and Gluttony. These minions have overtaken the land and it is The Master's duty to rid the world of this evil yet again.[CR]During the game's end credits, it is declared that "The Master will live forever", followed by an image of the statue of The Master slowly eroding over time. The statue's sword and right wing fall off, suggesting the growth of civilization and the increase of mankind's self-sufficiency. This reflects the ending of the original ActRaiser, where the servant speculates that someday the world may be so independent that it will forget about the Master.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]While the first ActRaiser split levels into sim-like stages and pure Rastan style action stages, ActRaiser 2 forgoes the sim elements for pure action. The overworld is still present for the player to get from land to land with helper angels returning to brief them on the situation for each town.[CR]Once on land, God would fight his way through the possessed and cursed towns eventually defeating the minion controlling it, thus returning it back to normal.[CR]While the game is still a traditional side scrolling action title, two key changes were made. One was the addition of a shield for a slightly more tactical approach similar to Zelda II: The Adventure of Link. The other addition was that of wings which could be used to reach new heights, glide over distances and put the player in position to do devastating aerial moves.[CR]Allusions to Other Media[CR]There are many elements in the game which act as allusions to classical literature, myth and religion. Each of the bosses, for example, are a manifestation of the seven deadly sins.[CR]Some of the stages in the game are meant to be ironic regarding the blighting nature of Tanzra's demons. The townsmen in the city of Leon are sent to the underground prison of Gratis for not paying their taxes by a newly appointed king named Kolunikus who is afflicted by Greed. The final level of the game pits the player against a mechanically engineered god in the city of Humbleton, a battle of Pride (a satire on the Biblical story of the Tower of Babel).[CR]After the player slays the first six deadly sins, the Tower Of Babel appears in which The Master fights the final sin, Pride. They then descend into Hell where they again fight the seven sins as well as Tanzra himself, a beast frozen waist-deep in a lake of ice (just as Satan was in the Inferno in The Divine Comedy).[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Sales[CR]The game sold about 180,000 copies worldwide, with 40,000 copies sold in Japan and Europe respectively and 100,000 sold in the USA.Critical ReceptionReceptionAggregate scoresAggregatorScoreGameRankings79%Review scoresPublicationScoreElectronic Gaming Monthly35 of 40IGN7.5 of 10Nintendo Power3.675 of 5AwardsEntityAwardElectronic Gaming MonthlyTop Game of the Month[CR]The game was reviewed in Electronic Gaming Monthly, issue 51, October 1993, page 48.

There are several stages in the game accessible through different doors in the main hall (there are also hidden doors that can lead to rooms with a good amount of pickups, or even some that can serve as short cuts), each housing an imprisoned member of Gomez's family. To free his family, Gomez must traverse each stage and defeat a boss.[CR]Pickups include: hearts which increase health; a sword that is lost after taking damage; a rapid firing marble like item, a power up that is also lost after taking damage; and yellow dollar signs, one hundred of which will award the player with an extra life.[CR]Once Gomez frees Uncle Fester, Wednesday, Pugsley, and Grandmama, he can then enter the final area of the game to save his wife, Morticia.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt is an action/platformer published by Ocean Software and released on multiple platforms. It is based on the 1992 animated series incarnation of The Addams Family, rather than the movies, live-action TV show or the original comics.[CR]The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt has a somewhat unusual release history; originally released on the SNES, versions for the Game Boy and Nintendo's previous console the NES were published a few months later. It was also made available in Europe several months before the US, as Ocean was a UK-based publisher.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt is a 2D platformer in which the player controls Pugsley Addams, who must venture forth into his house in search of items hidden by his sister Wednesday.[CR]Certain rooms, such as the bathroom level, are explored with Pugsley haven been shrunk in size. Different characters are also encountered in each of the rooms. For example, the Addams' butler Lurch is found in the Attic stage.[CR]The game is known for its colorful graphics but high difficulty and total lack of a password feature.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the NES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly's Mike Weigand gave the review score of 7 out of 10. He wrote, "...another version of the multi-platform game... if you played the SNES version, there is nothing here that is terribly different, except, of course, diminished graphics and sound. This is one of the better games for the NES system".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin is a variety of different games. The SNES version is a traditional side-scrolling action game whereas the Genesis version is a two player game that plays like a shooter. But instead of using guns, Batman and Robin uses Batarangs and other projectiles to take out their foes. The Sega CD version consists of just Batmobile levels.[CR]The SNES Version[CR]The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin was originally titled "Batman: The Animated Series" after the show. But since the show got a name change, the game was delayed and then renamed to what it is called today and Robin was added as an NPC. Despite his appearance in the game, Robin is not a playable character. Each level is based off episodes of the series and shared dialogue and moments from them. Before each level Batman must choose from a variety of different weapons to take with him.[CR]The SNES version had 8 levels:Level 1: Amused to Death[CR]The Joker and Harley Quinn broadcast a television message to Batman inviting him to meet them at The Joker's Funhouse.[CR]Boss: The Joker[CR]Based on the episode(s): Christmas with the Joker, Be A ClownLevel title cardLevel 2: No Green Peace[CR]Bizarre things are occurring at the forest in Gotham City suburban district there's only one person who would do such a thing.

Instead of using guns Batman and Robin use Batarangs. Levels are swarming with enemies and the player must "shoot" them to defeat them. If they get up close to the player then the heroes will either punch or kick them instead of throwing a Batarang. In some levels the player flies in a Batwing moving from the left to the right shooting down anything in their path. The plot features Mr. Freeze wanting to freeze Gotham . In the process he releases Joker, Two-Face, and Mad Hatter out of Arkham Asylum an attempt to distract Batman and Robin from his intentions. The Genesis version consists of four levels:Happy Birthday to Me!Bosses:Harley's RobotHarley QuinnJokerA Two-Sided StoryBosses:Two Face's AirshipLarge ShipTwo-FaceTea Time!Bosses:Giant CatGiant DollMad-HatterSnow in July?Boss:Mr. Freeze[CR]The Sega CD Version[CR]Pimp my ride![CR]The Sega CD version is a 3D driving game with levels comprising only of driving the Batmobile and Batplane from point A to point B - shooting enemy vehicles along the way. The CD version is well known for having over 16 minutes of original animated footage created purely for the game with no involvement from Warner Bros. Animation. These cutscenes would later be known as 'The Lost Episode' from the animated series. All the principal voice actors from the series like Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, Loren Lester, Arleen Sorkin and John Glover reprise their roles. The only thing missing from the source material is the original score by Danny Elfman and Shirley Walker. The game instead used its own "synth rock" style music.Enemies:Poison IvyThe RiddlerHarley QuinnThe JokerRupert ThorneClayface[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Codes[CR]C = CIRCLE, T = TRIANGLE, S = SQUARE, B =Blank[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra Continues[CR] When you are on the last life of your last continue, hit Start to pause and choose to return to the Batcave.

				<title_clean>Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle and Friends, The</title_clean>
				<plot>When we last saw our heroes, they were relaxing in the shadow of their new "soon to be opened" museum. But when disaster strikes Frostbite Falls, Rocky and Bullwinkle must jump into action to once again stop the evil Boris and Natasha from delivering stolen artifacts from the Rocky and Bullwinkle Museum to their Fearless Leader. Join Moose and Squirrel on their adventure to foil yet another attempt by Boris and Natasha to accomplish something utterly pointless.[CR]On the other hand, you could also take control of Mr. Peabody and Sherman on their adventures through time to teach Sherman valuable lessons. Then again (on a completely different hand) you can play Dudley Do-Right and save the beautiful (but pixelated) Nell from the dastardly Snidley Whiplash.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]Play Rocky and Bullwinkle as they climb mountains, swim streams, and explore caves in the pursuit of Boris and Natasha to get back their priceless trinkets. Avoid bouncing rocks, strange mechanical mice, and other such creatures on you adventure. This game also gives you the option to play side adventures such as Mr. Peebody and Sherman as they fight a dragon with bubblegum, or play Dudley Do-Right as he rides his horse Horse to try and outrun Snidley Whiplash's train to save the beautiful Nell Fenwick. After beating each side adventure, the game automatically transfers over to the main game. This is a fun side-scrolling action/adventure that is sure to give you hours of enjoyment, if not frustration, at the many challenges.[CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]A Button - JUMP[CR]B Button - JUMP[CR]X Button - N/A[CR]Y Button - ATTACK[CR]Start Button - PAUSE[CR]Select Button - N/A[CR][B]Hints:[/B][CR]Continues and Lives[CR]You only get 3 of each, so don't waste them![CR]Reviewer: grimjockey[CR]http://www.consoleclassix.com/snes/adventures_rocky_bullwinkle.html[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Aero the Acro-Bat 2 is a SNES-exclusive mascot platformer from Iguana Entertainment and SunSoft, and the sequel to the original Aero the Acro-Bat. The story involves Ektor narrowly surviving his climactic battle with Aero in the previous game, getting saved by his henchman Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel, while Aero accidentally falls into a magician's box and is teleported to an unknown location.[CR]As with the previous game, the platforming is built around Aero's ability to "drill" through the air. This works as both a means to attack enemies and as a double jump to get around obstacles, though the distance and direction is fixed: Aero can only fly at a 60 degree angle up or down (dependent on whether or not the player is holding down on the D-pad). Levels also have a number of secret areas and power-ups to find, often behind fake walls. Aero the Acro-Bat 2 also includes snowboarding levels.[CR]The credits of Aero the Acro-Bat 2 features a dedication to Ayrton Senna, the Formula One racer who passed away in the May of 1994.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Select[CR]Enter the options menu, and play music tracks in the following order: [B]10, 15, 06, 08[/B][CR]Start the game, pause, and press [B]Down + A + L + R[/B] together.</plot>

				<plot>You are the CEO of an airline company. Your goal is to become the most successful airline in the world by connecting all 22 cities with air routes, maintain a profit, and meet the required quota of passengers. If you cannot turn a profit for a year or meet the victory conditions in 32 years you lose. Some strategic decisions you must make include negotiating for open air routes, purchasing or selling aircraft, invest in branch offices and hotels, advertise your airline and set budgets. You must also pay attention to statistics like quarterly and annual sales reports, as well as city data. World events also affect your airline, from natural disasters to war and even the Olympic games, all of which will affect how many passengers you get. All the planes in the game are based on real-life aircraft, such as the Boeing 747 and the Concorde.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]At the New Game / Continue screen, press Select.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B]:[CR]Aerobiz Supersonic is a turn-based business strategy game, in which the player takes the reigns of a start-up airline and grows it into the largest airline in the world. The game is a simulation, but it does not aim for the same level of detail as its PC contemporaries. It is part of Koei's "Executive Series", which are mostly business simulations.[CR]The game features licensed aircraft from most major manufacturers, which become available (or go out of production) as time passes. Scripted world events (wars, the Olympics, the cold war) and random events (storms, plane crashes) sometimes alter the business climate, and are the game's only real plot points. The game is played on a simplified map of the real world, with cities whose locations and statistics bear some similarity to their real-life counterparts. An average playthrough on "Turbo" difficulty (medium) takes about two hours.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hidden Flag Game[CR]you can play the flag game with an existing game or a new one.  start a game and wait for the menu bar to appear.  pick the icon that looks like a super nes controller. press A, select to begin a game where you need to identify the flag.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Quicker Game[CR]Hold [B]L[/B] or [B]R[/B] and press [B]Y[/B] to move over the map quickly.

After barely surviving an encounter with the alien xenomorph life forms, you were returning to earth in hypersleep aboard your ship, the Sulaco. The Sulaco malfunctioned, jettisoning the emergency escape vehicle with the crew's cryotubes towards Fiorina "Fury" 161, a nearly abandoned maximum security work prison deep in space. You awoke to find yourself stranded on the isolated planet, the only survivor of the crash.[CR]The only Human survivor, that is.[CR]Because the Aliens you thought you'd left behind, the living nightmares you'd hoped, you'd prayed, you'd never see again, are with you. And the horror you thought was over is beginning anew.[CR]Somewhere in Fury 161, a Queen Alien is spawning dozens, if not hundreds, of offspring that feed on flesh. The alien egg pods are everywhere, but that's only the start of your problems. The aliens multiply by invading human bodies and growing inside them, and they've kidnapped the entire population of Fury 161![CR]You've lived through this once before. Somehow, you survived. Now, you must face the Aliens again, and stop them once and for all![CR]Armed with your weapons and your wits, you are on a mission of survival. Your objectives are clear: free the prisoners that have been trapped in alien cocoons, eliminate the alien offspring that are infesting fury 161, and destroy the Queen nesting deep within the prison. If this weren't enough, all of this must be completed before the Weyland-Yutani ship arrives and gives the xenomorphs an opportunity to escape and infest other worlds.[CR]You are engaged in the most frightening life or death struggle imaginable, and the odds are stacked against you.[CR]--From the SNES Alien 3 instruction manual.[CR][B]Overview:[/B]:[CR]Alien 3 was definitely a fun game. It had an already mega-popular story because of the huge success of the Alien movies. The graphics were awesome, with great attention to shading.[CR]The game wasn't always just shoot the enemies, sometimes you had to repair some computer equipment or weld doors shut. This added to the realism of the game, and this was the first time I had seen anything like that in a video game. It makes you feel like you really are Ripley, and you have to survive this nightmare. Survive by not just mindless violence, but by using your head, and skills.[CR]When it comes to firepower, this game had it all, from machine guns to flame throwers. The sounds effects sounded just like the movie, giving it that same scary movie feel. An action packed thrill ride stuffed to the brim with malevolent aliens trying to lay their eggs in your stomach. [CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]Alien 3, here's where it starts to get really good. All of your time is spent in the penal colony, running around in tunnels, getting supplies from the infirmary, blowing the heck out of aliens, saving prisoners, and welding doors shut to keep the aliens contained. When welding a door or fixing electronics, be sure the area is clear of enemies, so you will have enough time to finish the task.

				<title_clean>Andre Agassi Tennis</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Andre Agassi stars in his first tennis game that came out for the  SMS,  SNES,  Genesis and  Game Gear. This tennis game does not have any other notable tennis stars to note but features many game play options like practice, tournament and skins tournament that makes this game unique from other tennis games before it.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game uses the same rules of tennis that is played today. A player must get over 40 points to win a game, 6 games to win a set and win 2 sets out of the 3 to finish the full match. The game allows the player to play either singles or doubles in either tournament or skins tournament. They can even select what court surface to play on like grass, clay, hard or indoor. After the player selects a type of game, they will have a choice of any of these players: Andre AgassiTiger BallRon PepperDon MattBob "Bit" ChinGeorge KingCarol ArkCassie Nova[CR]Each athlete has attributes for them like speed, strength (backhand, forehand and server) and accuracy (backhand, forehand and server) which makes the choice of athlete an interesting one. Once an athlete has been selected, two main buttons will be used during the match. The (A) button will help the player lob the ball in the air while the (B) button will help them hit the ball normally (this is for the Genesis version). When the ball is served or hit on the player's side of the court, they must get as close as possible to the ball and hit it back. The player can use either a backhand or forehand depending on their position before hitting the ball. They can move around the court and position themselves using the D-pad.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]Practice Mode - This mode allows the player to select an athlete and have a ball machine feed them balls so the player can practice their game. There are no winner or losers in this mode.Tournament Mode - Like a career mode, the player selects an athlete to play as in a tournament and face many opponents before facing the final match and winning it all.Skins Tournament Mode - This is a tournament that places money down on each hit that takes place during the match. Whoever wins a point will receive the total amount of money in the pot. The pot starts with $10 and doubles each hit from there on in.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Always Win[CR]At the title screen, press B, A, Y, X, R, L, Start.  You win now become unbeatable.</plot>

				<title_clean>Animaniacs</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Animaniacs is a platforming game released by Konami on the SNES and Genesis consoles. Although they share some similarities, the two games are quite different. The SNES version of the game allows for the player to switch between the three characters, Yakko, Wakko and Dot, at will. There are no actual "lives" in this game: the game ends when every character is captured. Also, the characters move left, right, up and down, similar to the Final Fight series of games but dissimilar to many other platformer games. The game's goal is to retrieve the lost pages of a script stolen by Pinky and The Brain, in order to stop their attempt to "try and take over the world". Each level has many references to and parodies of different films, such as Indiana Jones.[CR]The Genesis version is different from the SNES version and shares more similarities to a normal platformer game. This game has some elements of The Lost Vikings games, in that each character has a special trait that must be used to overcome obstacles in each level: for example, Yakko can push heavy objects, Wakko can use his hammer to break blocks, and Dot can use her charm ("air kiss") to stop male characters obstructing the level. Each level is a parody of a different movie genre and can be played out of order (non-linear, much like the Mega Man series). The goal of the game is to retrieve stolen artifacts from movies so as to, yet again, stop Pinky and the Brain from taking over the Warner Brothers studio and the world.[CR]Both games are also tongue-in-cheek in nature, often having various references to popular films and even fourth wall moments. Specifically, the beginning cutscene of the Animaniacs game for Genesis has the characters talking about themselves being in a video game (and "welcoming" the player to the game).[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Tonight is the night of the thousand years full moon! At this moment, four brave warriors are rushing up a steep, narrow mountain pass to an ancient ruined shrine. There, they will battle the Dark Lords of Castomira, and ultimately confront the Dark Sorceress. These warriors have pledged their lives to the troubled king of Arcus to recapture the mighty Sword of Light, which Castomira has stolen - the weapon used by Princess Leaty to defeat Castomira a thousand years before this night. They are Jedda the swordsman, Erin the warrior-maiden, Diana the archer, and Bead the magic stick-fighter. To defeat the enemy, the warriors will call upon their individual magic powers: Jedda will wield his fire magic; Erin will harness the power of the wind; Diana will use her healing rays of light; and Bead will mimic the magic of the dark lords. They must not falter in their quest, or the diabolical Castomira will assume absolute power, and darkness will reign... forever.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bead Passwords[CR]On the main menu, select Password and enter any one of the following:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bead Passwords[CR]On the main menu, select Password and enter any one of the following:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bead Passwords[CR]On the main menu, select Password and enter any one of the following:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bead Passwords[CR]On the main menu, select Password and enter any one of the following:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Duplicate Inventory[CR]Start the game in two-player mode and let player two die.</plot>

In some situations, Pec can also be used to destroy blocks or as a jetpack to fly through areas of a level depending on the color.[CR]Stars can be collected in the game and with some automatically give 10 stars. If the player collects 100 stars, an extra life is granted.[CR]There are 10 levels on total with a steep difficulty on the level design itself.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Miscellaneous Codes[CR]Enter the following at the title screen:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Passwords[CR]At the title screen select password then with Ardy pick up and arrange the cherry, grape, and orange blocks with A.

				<title_clean>Art of Fighting</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]Art of Fighting (known in Japan as Ryuuko no Ken) is a fighting game developed and published by  SNK for the  Neo Geo. Although overshadowed by  Street Fighter II, released a year earlier, Art of Fighting innovated the fighting game genre through its use of large character sprites (with battle damage), camera zooming, taunting, super and "desperation" moves, and a "spirit gauge" that depletes when certain moves are used.[CR]The game takes place in the late seventies in the fictional city of South Town, where  Ryo Sakazaki and  Robert Garcia must find out the whereabouts of Ryo's kidnapped sister,  Yuri. The game is set decades before the events of  Fatal Fury. SNK would regularly find ways to integrate characters from this game into Fatal Fury and vice versa before eventually creating The King of Fighters series, which pits characters from both Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting against each other irrespective of continuity.[CR]The game was originally released in the Arcades and on the Neo Geo and Neo Geo CD. It was soon ported to the Super Nintendo, Genesis/Mega Drive and Turbo-CD platforms. Since then, it's been rereleased in the Art of Fighting Anthology for PlayStation 2 in 2006, on the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007 and on the PSN store in 2011. Each of the rereleases are based on the Neo Geo home version.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game plays like traditional fighting games. The player has two basic attack buttons: punch and kick. The third button is a "utility" button which can allow the player to do stronger punches and kicks (when combined with the punch or kick buttons), throws, and walljumps. The fourth button is a taunting button. Not every character can perform throws and walljumps. This game also features dashing forwards and backwards by pressing the joystick in either direction twice. Fireballs can be canceled out using punches or kicks.[CR]The game also features a "spirit gauge", which controls when the player can perform special and super moves. The gauge lowers after the player performs a special/super move. The more powerful the move, the more the gauge depletes. The gauge also depletes when the opponent performs a taunt. The gauge can only be recharged manually by holding down either the punch or kick button. It will be in one of three colors (green, yellow, or red) depending on the amount left.[CR]Only Ryo and Robert have super (the Haou Shou Ken) and "desperation" (Ryuko Ranbou) moves that can only be learned through a special bonus stage. Both moves take up much of the spirit gauge, but the desperation move can only be performed when the player has 20% life or less (as indicated by a flashing life bar).[CR]In single-player Story mode, the player is usually at a disadvantage with shorter life and spirit gauges. These can be increased in special bonus stages, where the player must perform a certain task (careful button pressing or button mashing).[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR] Ryo Sakazaki (playable in one-player story mode) Robert Garcia (playable in one-player story mode) Ryuhaku Todoh Jack Turner Lee Pai Long King Mickey Rogers John Crawley Mr. Big (only playable in two-player battle mode by either reaching the final stage and then letting another player join in or via cheat code) Mr. Karate (only playable in two-player battle mode by either reaching the final stage and then letting another player join in or via cheat code)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Ingame Codes[CR]While playing, press Select to pause the game and press the following buttons:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Ingame Codes[CR]Start a new game, then select the Story Mode.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Axelay is a side- and vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up from Konami created specifically for the Super Nintendo to take advantage of its Mode 7 capabilities. Many of the stages employ this tech, displaying a wraparound affect in some stages as the player flies over the horizon of planets. The game was released in 1992 (1993 for Europe) and was later released on the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Axelay takes place in the fictional Illis Solar System, which is under attack by alien invaders known as the Armada of Annihilation, which seeks to take over the planets of Illis. The game begins on the planet Corliss, which is similar to Earth. The player must take their ship, the D117B Axelay Fighter and free the planets of Illis, eventually making their way to the Fortress of the Armada of Annihilation and stop the invasion.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]If the game is completed twice on the hardest difficulty, a message appears and promises a sequel to Axelay. However, an Axelay 2 was never released and no plans for a sequel have yet to materialize. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]B.O.B. is a  side-scrolling shooter developed by  Gray Matter Interactive that was released on the  Genesis and  SNES platforms in 1993. B.O.B. was also included as a part of the  EA Replay compilation which was released for the  PSP handheld in 2006.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]B.O.B. is just a common teenage  robot looking to score his dad&#8217;s car keys and get to his hot date. After a long lecture from his father about responsibility and how he&#8217;ll never drive again if there&#8217;s even a single scratch, B.O.B.&#8217;s journey to pick up his hot date begins. Whilst cruising through the universe in his dad&#8217;s pimped out pink space Cadillac and listening to rock n&#8217; roll full blast on the stereo, B.O.B. blindly wanders into an asteroid field and proceeds to plow his father&#8217;s car straight into the side of an asteroid. B.O.B. crash lands on a mysterious planet filled with hostile robots and creatures. He proceeds to blast his way through every last baddie and boss the foul planet has to throw at him until he finally reaches the end where he finds a brand new car. From there he continues on to find himself a hot fembot.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]B.O.B. is at its core a shooter. The player starts with only a standard single shot weapon, but there are five additional ammo types the can be collected throughout the world. These consist of a  spread shot,  flamethrower,  missiles, lightning, and wave. If B.O.B. happens to run low on ammo, he is able to perform a  melee attack by throwing a massive  fist. In addition to standard weapons, there are six remotes that can be collected to help B.O.B. make it through the hostile terrain. These include items which not only are offensive, but also some that make B.O.B. more able to navigate through the twists, turns, and obstacles that he faces. The remotes include a light, a protective shield that grants  temporary invincibility, an  umbrella that slows B.O.B.&#8217;s descent on long drops, a  spring that allows for high jumps, a propeller that allows B.O.B. to fly for short distances, and a time bomb that clears the screen of all enemies. B.O.B.&#8217;s  health can be refilled by picking up the wrench item or by stepping into a recharger.[CR]B.O.B. moves between levels linearly via an  overworld map. Unlike other shooters, B.O.B. is not a strictly walk from left to right affair though. The game combines the shooting elements with platforming elements and presents worlds filled with obstacles where the player must navigate up, down, left, and right. In addition to standard levels, there are also some vehicle levels where B.O.B. has to fly a car through a maze-like environment to the finish line. A  time-limit is present on every stage. Once the timer goes down to zero, B.O.B.&#8217;s life will start quickly depleting until either the player reaches the end of the stage or B.O.B. dies.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Start on any stage with everything.[CR]Just replace the second letter in your password with a ''9'' and you will have 99 of each weapon. This works on all levels.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Barbie Super Model concerns Barbie's attempts at being a super model. Mostly, it consists of her daydreaming and avoiding obstacles while also trying to look good and perfect her routine. The game features multiple stages filled with mini-games. At the mid-point of each stage, the player practices a catwalk routine, and then must replicate the same routine at the end of each stage.[CR]The game has two difficulty levels: Junior Model (Easy) and Super Model (Hard).[CR]Short-lived developers Tahoe Software Productions created the game for the Super Nintendo, the Sega Genesis and PC DOS. A Sega Game Gear version was planned but canceled mid-development.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Barbie Super Model consists of very linear stages. It has four stages in total:Driving Stage[CR]This stage features Barbie driving a pink car and having to avoid other cars, who are driving quite dangerously.Rollerskating Stage[CR]This stage requires Barbie avoid other people and birds.Cycling Stage[CR]This stage features Barbie on a bicycle. She has to avoid birds and frisbees.Hiking Stage[CR]This stage features Barbie hiking through snow. She must avoid people towing sleds, icy patches on the ground and snowballs.[CR]Mini-games[CR]Each stage consists of the same three mini-games. These are:Body Magazine Cover[CR]Here, the player has to match Barbie's clothes to those shown on the magazine color. Barbie has a vast wardrobe, and the player is also expected to manually change colors if needed.Catwalk Practice[CR]Before turning around and going back the other way on every stage, the player is told a sequence of buttons to press to make up Barbie's modelling routine. They can practice it as many times as they like, but they need to memorize the buttons for later.Face Magazine Cover[CR]This is similar to the first mini-game, except the magazine cover shows Barbie's face instead. The player must match Barbie's accessories and make up to resemble her cover shot on the magazine.[CR]At the end of each level, the catwalk practice sequence is then used again, this time without prompts. The player must do the same sequence again from memory.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Barbie Vacation Adventure</title_clean>
				<plot>In Barbie Vacation Adventure, Barbie, along with her friend Midge in two-player mode, travels around the country to four different vacation spots, each with its own set of mini games.[CR]In Iowa, at a county fair, Barbie must catch an escaped pig by walking up to it and pressing the action button, after that she can play carnival games.  The options are a strength test, knocking down cans and a hit-the clown game.  In the latter two, players can  aim balls with the d-pad, then throw with the action button.  Leading targets is required.  The strength test has a mater that goes up and down and Barbie must land her hit when the indicator is on the bell to ring it.[CR]In Wyoming, Barbie goes camping.  First, she must assemble her tent.  This is essentially a jigsaw puzzle.  Next, she must jump from rock to rock to get to the other side of the park where she can go on a nature hike.  In the next segment, players aim a camera cursor at animals as Barbie walks along the path and hit the action button to take photos.  This requires good reaction time.[CR]There's a ranch in Texas where Barbie can ride horses.  The horse runs on its own.  The player pushes the action button to make it jump.  There are numerous gates on the course and the player must time jumps correctly to clear them.  If they hit too many, they must start over.  There is also the option to play horseshoes.  The cursor moves about erratically and you must press the action button when it passes over the stake.[CR]In Florida, Barbie can play volleyball against Midge.  This game allows both players to play simultaneously in two-player mode.  Barbie and Midge can move forward or backward on the court and hit action to set the ball.  First one to ten points wins.  There is also a diving segment where barbies must navigate an underwater maze to collect sunken treasure. It might remind some people of Barbie's Ocean Discovery.[CR]Finally, there is Barbie's home in California.  Ken has hidden presents around the house and Barbie must find them and identify them by shape.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Barkley: Shut Up and Jam! is a 2-on-2 street basketball game similar to NBA Jam. Charles Barkley is the only NBA player featured in the game while everyone else is a fictional character. The game is best known for its attitude, such as referring to Barkley as Sir Charles and giving street nicknames to the other competitors. It also adheres to a more "Arcade" feel for its gameplay, allowing for absurd dunks and distant three-pointers, similar to its contemporary NBA Jam (also released in 1993).[CR]Barkley Factor[CR]Sir Charles brought his likeness to the game as well as his voice. The game frequently used aggressive Barkley voice samples including "Time for some pain", "Time out" and "Play hard or get out".[CR]Barkley: Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden[CR]The game's mixed reputation spawned a spiritual sequel in the form of the popular fan-made freeware RPG Barkley: Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden. Set in the year 2053, the game adopts Japanese-style RPG combat with a story revolving around the demise of basketball. Charles Barkley is the protagonist, and the game features cameos from many celebrities, fictitious characters, and other basketball stars.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Bass Masters Classic</title_clean>
				<plot>This game consists of five 3-day tournaments at four lakes. The mission is to catch as much large bass as possible. Once the day of the fishing tournament is over, the five largest bass that were caught get weighed and are compared to the other fisherman's catches. The one with the heaviest catch is the winner.[CR]The player starts off choosing an angler. Then the player can either go to the bait shop, practice pond, or start in the tournament. In the bait shop, choices of baits, lines, rods, reels, fish finders, and boat engines are available for purchase. The practice pond mode is just where the player can cut his teeth on the game mechanics without consequence.[CR]The tournament mode is the main part of the game. Players start out in a fishing boat. Some of the factors that can affect your fishing are temperature, wind speed, water clarity and time of day. After casting the line, the game goes from an above the lake view to a side view of the lake water depths. Then it's just up to the player to attract the fish with the bait, and after the fish is caught on the hook, reel it in.</plot>

				<plot>Bassin's Black Bass is a fishing game endorsed by the professional fishing champion Hank Parker. It is another entry in Hot-B's long line of fishing games. Players aim to become a professional fisherman and can travel by themselves or along with Hank.[CR]There are four different fishing areas players advance to as they win each round of the tournament. Players travel by boat on the water, select a fishing spot and then select lure and cast fish. Certain types of fish are only available at specific spots. There is also a fish radar that makes a sound when there is fish nearby. Players need to select the correct type of lure (there are about 20), keep track of weather conditions and the limited time available in tournaments. Some fish fight back hard and need to be reeled in with careful timing.[CR]The four tournaments are Local Amateur Tournament, Amateur Bass Championship, Pro Bass Tournament and Bassin' World Championship. About eight types of fish can be caught.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Debug Mode[CR]Hold X + Y on controller one, A + B on controller two, and turn on the SNES. The words ''Debug Mode'' will appear on the screen. Begin a game and use these commands while in the game:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Getting the Buzzbait[CR]This lure is found in the third tournament. Go to the southeastern part of the area, and select "Cast" in the Timber area. Eventually, you'll find this lure, and it will be added to your collection of lures for you to use.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Getting the Buzzbait[CR]To get the Crayfish, you must be in the second tournament. In the second tournament, search the middle to northeastern part of the rocks and this lure will eventually be found if you keep casting. Be careful not to break your boat, though. The Crayfish is an extremely useful lure, so it's nice to find it![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Getting the Buzzbait[CR]This lure is found at the first tournament. Go to the eastern part of the area, and select "Cast" while under the trees. After awhile, you'll obtain this hidden lure. It will be added to your lure collection for you to use.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Getting the Buzzbait[CR]On the fourth tournament (The very last one), search in the western side of the dump and keep casting in that western area of the dump, and the lure should be found shortly after.</plot>

				<plot>Batman: Revenge of the Joker, also known as "really crappy Batman" was going to be released by Sunsoft in 1992. The company that developed it was Icom Simulations. It was released on the Genesis and NES, but was likely not released on the snes because it was too bad. The thing that gets me is that the enemy patterns have a distinct behaviour that reminds me of Total Recall for the NES. The rom of the game is floating around should you feel the need to play this.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Area Passwords:[CR]At the title screen select password and enter the following chain.[CR]DNCN Stage 02[CR]MCHT Stage 03[CR]DDPP Stage 04[CR]LDRN Stage 05[CR]KLTT Stage 06[CR]CRLB Stage 07[CR]LKCM Stage 08[CR]DVWH Stage 09[CR]TTKR Stage 10[CR]BTMR Stage 11[CR]VNGF Stage 12[CR]http://www.snescentral.com/article.php?id=0118[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Area Passwords[CR]At the title screen select password and enter the following chain.</plot>

				<title_clean>Batman Forever</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Batman Forever is a 2D beat 'em up developed by Acclaim London and published by Acclaim for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis in 1995. Loosely based on the 1995 film of the same name, up to two players team up as either Batman or his sidekick Robin as they set out to foil the plans of criminal Two-Face and puzzler The Riddler. Unlike traditional beat 'em up games, Batman Forever combines 2D platforming with fighting game controls (in similar vein to Mortal Kombat). The game features a non-linear level structure (with puzzles) and fully-digitized actors.[CR]The game was ported to the Game Gear, Game Boy, and PC by Probe. Another Acclaim-published beat 'em up based on the same movie was released for arcades in 1996 under the same name. Also sporting fully-digitized actors, it was later released for the PlayStation and Saturn as Batman Forever: The Arcade Game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players can choose between playing as the Caped Crusader or his sidekick, Robin or can even add a second controller for co-operative play.[CR]The fighting aspect of the game resembles the engine for the "Mortal Kombat" games, right down to the motion-captured characters and the basic fighting moves (uppercut, high and low punch, etc).[CR]Players can also choose what gadgets to bring along in each level, which each gadget having it's own pro's and cons. Arguably, the most useful gadget is the grappling hook, which gets the character to higher parts of the level that couldn't be reached before.[CR]The game includes many secrets, such as different hidden gadgets and multiple "riddles" from The Riddler himself.[CR]</plot>

He wrote, "...Ugh! This one-on-one fighting game needs better control and more fighters to choose from. Not exactly the greatest challenge either -- some fighters have unfair advantages over others and they can win almost every match. The graphics are alright, but the sound needs work".[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Battle Clash</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Normal combat scene in Battle Clash.[CR]Battle Clash (known as Space Bazooka in Japan) has the player using the Super Scope to fight giant mech battles. It received a sequel, Metal Combat: Falcon's Revenge the next year.[CR]There are minor regional differences, with the Japanese version, mainly in the ending credits. The US version, Mike Anderson is simply on a blue background. In the Japanese version, he is joined by others beside the Falcon (his ST), depending on the difficulty level.[CR]Another interesting point is that this is one of the few mech games to be released in Japan without any reference TO Japan. Stereotypically, Japan acts as the origin for most giant mechs, but here it is left ambiguous.[CR]As a point of interest, Battle Clash (and its sequel) were developed by Gunpei Yokoi, the man responsible for Super Metroid, the Game Boy and the Virtual Boy.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR] Anubis's ST, Thanatos.[CR]Earth is currently in chaos and shambles, and the only order to be found is in the Battle Game. The winner, of course, gains control of the world. These battles are fought with giant mechs known as Standing Tanks (ST). The current ruler is an evil fighter known as Anubis, a position he gained by killing many people.[CR]Mike Anderson, the player's partner, lost his father during Anubis's ascent to power and has dedicated his life to training himself until he was strong enough to defeat Anubis. However, to even get the chance to fight Anubis, the player (as the ST's gunner) and Mike must fight through all of Anubis's Battle Chiefs, each of whom controls a region of the world.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The STs fight one-on-one, and with only the most basic of rules: the object is to destroy the other ST before it destroys the player's. This is accomplished by shooting the other ST (with the Super Scope peripheral), while at the same time shooting its projectiles before they hit the player.[CR]The gun works in a rapid-fire mode, where the player can simply hold down the first button, or it can be charged to shoot energy bolts. These energy bolts can only be fired when the energy bar has been filled up, and the bar is drained after each shot. The bar charges whenever the player is not shooting, so going for an energy bolt can be a risky maneuver. However, it is important to note that some of the opponents' attacks can only be deflected by an energy bolt. Attack its weak point for massive damage![CR]Because Mike Anderson is the ST's driver, every battle in this game is like most boss battles in on-rails shooters. Damage done depends on where the shot lands, with each ST having some sort of weak point. Energy bolts do more damage, but as noted above, are riskier propositions. Also, it is important to realize that there is a 10-minute time limit on each battle at which point the player loses, regardless of the respective health bars of the STs.[CR]As a point of strategy, it is worth noting that the STs take localized damage. If the player destroys one of the opponents weapons, it won't be able to fire, or if the rocket boosters are destroyed, it won't be able to fly. This allows for a good bit of strategic variety in how the player approaches any given battle.[CR]The game also supplies minor power-ups, of which the player may have four at any given time. These include things like increased accuracy, a variety of bombs, and a variety of shield upgrades.[CR]As the gunner in the ST, the player is freed from most details about movement. To go left or right, they simply need to aim the Super Scope at the left or right side of the screen.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR] Mike[CR]Despite being a Japanese game, Mike is the generic All-American Hero. His ST is The Falcon, with the player as the gunner. The Falcon is a bit of a character itself, periodically dispensing advice. Guido[CR]Guido is stereotypical Appalachian mountain man, and the Chief of North America. His ST, Garam is a huge gorilla-esque beast of a machine, and his ego and temper both match the size of his ST.[CR]  Ikhnaton[CR]Continuing on with the stereotypes, Ikhnaton is the Chief of Africa. He is a fat and wealthy arms dealer, who also happens to be an oil tycoon. His insect-like ST, Scarab, is heavily armored.[CR]  Lorca[CR]The Chief of Europe is an androgynous (and creepy) pilot named Lorca. Extremely vain, he refers to himself as the "Bard of Battle," and pilots an ST known also as Lorca.[CR]  Tasha[CR]The only woman in the game is Tasha, the Chief of South America. She eventually falls in love with Mike after being defeated, and she joins him later on. Her ST, Artemis, carries a heavy payload of very strong missiles.[CR]  Alfred[CR]The Chief of Asia is Alfred, a brilliant but cowardly engineer. His ST flies via an anti-gravity device, and has protective orbs that circle it and deflect attacks.[CR]  Antonov[CR]Antonov is the Chief of Oceania, and his ST is a giant armored crab name Ivan. He secretly longs to defeat Anubis.[CR]  Eddie[CR]Eddie is not actually a Battle Chief, but rather a brainwashed general in the space military. His job is to guard the Tower of Babel, which leads to space. Valius is his ST, a ninja-like mech whose main strength is its agility.[CR]  Carlos[CR]Another general in the space military, Carlos was corrupted by Anubis due to his own questionable ambitions. He guards the Moonbase Luna using a more advanced version of Mike's Falcon, known as the Baron. He and Mike form a lasting rivalry.[CR] Anubis [CR]Anubis is the current ruler of the world, an evil tyrant, and doesn't quite appear to be human. His ST, Thanatos, is extremely powerful, almost bordering on supernatural. It has many biomechanical upgrades, and can transform into a creature out of a B-grade horror film.[CR]Presentation[CR]Battle Clash's visual style is reminiscent of other SNES games of that time period, in particular F-Zero. Both use the same scaling and parallax techniques and have a similar sci-fi theme. The music is similarly pop-ish between the two, though Battle Clash's was composed by Yuka Tsujiyoko, who is most well known for his work on Fire Emblem. In addition, more attention is paid to the small details (ST damage, intricate animations) than in many other titles of this era.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Battle Clash received a 3.775 (out of 5) from Nintendo Power.[CR]It is also the only Super Scope game to receive a sequel.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Battle Grand Prix</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Battle Grand Prix is a top-down F1 racing game that uses a split-screen for both its one-player and two-player modes. The player can select from three difficulty modes (Beginner, Pro, Expert) and several modes, including a long-form Survival mode and a single competitive race Versus mode.[CR]There's also a Slot mode that re-imagines the vehicles as slot cars: in this mode, the player simply has to regulate their car's speed for corners and straights while the car automatically steers its way through a pre-defined course.[CR]The game has forty fictional drivers to choose from, who are only known by their initials and country of origin. While a majority of the racers are Japanese, all manner of countries from across the globe are represented. Likewise, there are courses to race on from all over the world, each with their own quirks and weather conditions.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 5,6,5,6 adding, "...the constant overhead display with the annoying split screen is the real turn off because you can't see what's coming up. The amount of options is nice but other than that, it's just a simple racing game without much flair".[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Battletoads in Battlemaniacs</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Battletoads in Battlemaniacs is the first  SNES release of the popular  Battletoads series, continuing the trend of ludicrous humor and storylines, coupled with brutal difficulty established by its predecessor,  Battletoads. The traditional  side-scrolling beat 'em up gameplay mechanics are retained, as are occasional off-beat action sequences like the speeder bike chase.[CR]Continuing the ludicrous story from the original game, Battlemaniacs sees Rash and Pimple sucked into an virtual world of Professor T. Bird's virtual reality machine T.R.I.P.S. (Total Reality Integrated Playing System) and setting out to rescue the kidnapped daughter of the CEO that sponsored Professor T. Bird's project as well as their fearless leader Zitz.[CR]Battlemaniacs was to receive a Master System port in Europe on July 1994, but it was cancelled last second. This port was eventually released in Brazil by Tec Toy, though the quality of the build was far from finished.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Cheat - Super Jump[CR]When you first turn on the game it will say "Tradewest Presents".

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bazooka Blitzkrieg is a on-rails first-person shooter for the Super Nintendo and one of the few games to support the Super Scope peripheral. It's also the first Super Scope game not to be developed by Nintendo themselves, or one of its subsidiary studios.[CR]The game is a standard on-rails shooter: the screen scrolls automatically while targets pop up for the player to shoot with the Super Scope. The game has a sci-fi theme, with many cyborg aggressors and large, multi-part mechanical bosses to destroy. The player can switch from rapid but weak machine gun fire to a powerful charge shot, similarly to Battle Clash.[CR]The game has the far plainer title of "Destructive" in Japan. Like most Super Scope games, its release in its home territory happened many months after its US release.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>This side-scrolling beat em' up game is based on a 1992 Paramount Pictures animated movie which was the first ever to feature an all-Black main cast. The characters were originally from comedian Robin Harris' "Bb's Kids" (pronounced Bay-Bay) stand-up comedy act. They're described as little hellions and bad-ass troublemaker kids.  In this game, someone has taken control of the Fun World amusement park, and you've got to help Kahlil, LaShawn, and PeeWee make things right. [CR]You can play as either Kahlil or LaShawn and can use each character's different special attacks. Kahlil uses a spin-tuck to take out almost any enemy you meet and LaShawn uses powerful cartwheels. Enemies such as animatronic robots and security guards must be taken out in the first time-limited level.  Some items can also be picked up and thrown at enemies.   The second level has the baby PeeWee in a china shop knocking glasses off shelves and you must break 10 before they hit you or the ground or are grabbed by your caretaker Robin.  There is also a haunted house maze level where you must keep trying different doors until you find the exit[CR]while avoiding mummies along the way. Then there's a pirate ship beat em' up level and eventually you make your way to the underground control center and the Big Boss.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Developers Debug Code[CR]At the Paramount Pictures logo, press Up, Down, X, R, A, Y, B, A, B, Y.The game will immediately start as well as place photos of the development team through various spots in the game.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Beethoven: The Ultimate Canine Caper is a side-scrolling platformer, based on the 1993 movie sequel Beethoven's 2nd (the game's title screen refers to the game as such as well). Each level challenges the player to rescue one of Beethoven and Missy's puppies, and is divided into 2 stages each. In the first stage the objective is to get to the puppy while in the second, Beethoven must carry the puppy back to Missy.[CR]Beethoven was released for the Super Nintendo and PC by Hi-Tech Expressions. Rozner Labs Software Group developed the DOS version, while the SNES version was handled by Riedel Software Productions (or RSP) Inc. A Game Boy port released the following year was developed by Unexpected Development.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Beethoven's main attack is his loud barking, which releases supersonic waves that can devastate man or beast. Barks can be "charged" by growling, resulting in even greater destructive power. Beethoven can also shake water off of his body, once soaked by a sprinkler or other water fixture, in order to hurt enemies.[CR]</plot>

[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay is similar to other 2D fighting games, with two characters combining kicks and punches to wear down the opponent's health, displayed as a series of 'lights' above the ring. Players are able to customize their fighter by choosing their appearance, as well as which techniques to include in the character's move set, with the majority of the techniques being accurate kickboxing, Muay Thai and Tae-Kwon-Do moves. Players are also able to train a fighter, with practice sparring and pad drills increasing the speed and strength of the fighter.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Kumate Warp[CR]Go to the main menu, highlight Options and press select. Select password in the top left corner and enter the following: [CR]2RHT255457K [CR]Return to the main menu, select Ivanov as your opponent and defeat him. You can now enter Kumate mode.

				<plot>On day an alien race of slugs is out patrolling space, when they encounter the Lucasarts logo. The logo, as we all know looks like a statue of a person with his hands extending towards the sky. Seeing this logo, the slugs determine that ours is a race made up of BONES and of ADVERTISING, two things the slugs simply hate. So they attack.[CR]With the slug invasion in full swing, earth is quite simply outnumbered by the gooey slugs. It must recruit special super soldiers, Big Sky Troopers, armed with a special heavily armored suit to combat the menace. So urgent is the need for qualified Big Sky Troopers, that recruiting and rank are petty things. It is not unknown for example for a brand new trooper to start as a 21-star general in the army.[CR]Once selected, it is up to your Big Sky Trooper, piloting a FIDO class starship, to engage the slugs in space and in planetfall and thwart their plans to destroy mythical galactic devices and conquer humanity.</plot>

				<title_clean>Biker Mice from Mars</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Biker Mice From Mars is an isometric racing game based on the 1990s cartoon of the same name. Three anthropomorphic mice from Mars (who happen to be bikers) escape to Earth after their home planet is conquered by the fish-like Plutarkians and help the citizens of Earth to avoid the same fate.[CR]This Super Nintendo game from Konami is a racing game with vehicular combat that pits the trio of Biker Mice - Throttle, Modo and Vinnie - against several of their recurring enemies: Greasepit, Dr. Karbunkle and Lawrence Limburger. Each character has their own distribution of three core stats: Max speed, grip (handling) and acceleration. It uses an isometric perspective and plays similarly to Rare's RC Pro-Am or Blizzard's Rock N' Roll Racing.[CR]When the animated TV show was rebooted in 2006 it saw equivalent video game adaptations for the Nintendo DS and PlayStation 2. Those games should not be mistaken for this one.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Max Upgrade Passwords[CR]Start in round 1 with all upgrades maxed, on hard or super hard, with specific characters.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra boost of speed[CR]While running in any type of race, you can rapidly press the B button to gain a boost of energy that is similar to a nitro.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]BioMetal is a horizontal-scrolling shoot 'em up for the SNES developed by Athena, who produced the SNES shoot 'em up Strike Gunner S.T.G. the previous year. Athena published the game in Japan, and Activision published it in Europe and the US.[CR]The player can assume one of six ship types in order to fight the eponymous hostile Biometals, an alien species bent on exterminating the human race. The design of the Biometals is strongly inspired by Alien and H.R. Giger. The biggest difference between the Japanese and European/American versions is the inclusion of instrumental music based on techno band 2 Unlimited's "Get Ready" album. The Japanese version has an entirely different soundtrack.[CR]The game was followed up with BioMetal Gust, for the Sega Saturn.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly's Mike Weigand gave Biometal a review score of 6 out of 10. He wrote, "...All the elements of an average shooter are here: huge bosses, tons of power-ups and weapons and great graphics. Unfortunately the perky techno-pop music by pop music group 2 Unlimited just doesn't belong...".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Blackthorne is an action-adventure platformer. The player is put in control of the games protagonist, Kyle "Blackthorne" Vlaros as he progresses through the games many levels, attempting to thwart the evil Sarlac.[CR]The game was initially released in 1994 for both SNES and PC. It was then later ported to Sega 32X, Mac, and GBA. In 2013, the game was released as a free PC download via Battle.net.Gameplay[CR]Blackthorne on the 32X[CR]The games levels are large, and winding, and are filled with puzzles and enemies. Kyle will have to run, jump, and climb in order to get around each level, and utilize a number of tools as well. The game's control is, generally, slower than most platformers. The player loses a lot of control when they run, and running is best for long, straight corridors and long jumps. For the most part, the player will progress slowly, climbing up ledges, and making tough jumps.[CR]Combat in Blackthorne is slow and strategic. The player wields a shotgun with unlimited ammo, and can use grenades in combat as well, though these are best used to destroy doors. When an enemy is encountered, they will often back up and wait before attacking. Kyle can also back up to avoid their shots. Enemies will reload and move after shooting, which is when the player should take advantage to eliminate their foe.[CR]Items play a large role in Blackthorne. They are numerous, and used in many instances for puzzles and clearing obstacles. There are also a number of interactive items in the environment that Kyle must use.ItemsThe Levitator.Hover Bomb: A basic granade like item that explodes on contact. Will kill most enemies in one strike, but is most useful for destroying doorways.Bridge Key: Electronic keys that activate bridges. Bridge keys can be removed and work on any bridge.Remote Wasp: A floating bomb that Kyle can control remotely. He is completely open to attack when using the bomb.Potion: Refills Kyle's stamina.Levitator: A triangular platform which extends into a pillar that Kyle can stand on to reach high areas.Iron Key: A key which deactivates laser fieldsFire Bomb: Bombs which damage anything they contact, and explode the moment they hit the ground.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>A united space force known as the Imperial Earth Army was launched past the Solar System. When the Imperial Earth Army returned, it came armed with large, living robots known as Bio-Cyborgs that it used to dominate and oppress the societies of Earth. Players assume the role of a rebel forces pilot who has launched a surprise attack against the oppressive Imperial Earth Army, armed with a recently developed weapon capable of controlling the Bio-Cyborgs.[CR]The player is set in control of The Garland TFF-01, a sub-standard space fighter ship that is only armed with a semi-auto or rapid fire laser gun known as the Beam Vulcan and the Tranquilander. Some enemy units can be captured and used in play; certain enemy robots, when shot by the player's Tranquilander, will morph into an outline of themselves. The player can then fly into the outline, and take on the form of the enemy robot, taking control of its weapons, agilities and special attacks.[CR]There is also addition to the boss battle scoring: similar to some shooters, players have the opportunity to increase their scores by beating the end level bosses within a certain time limit. Every time a boss battle is initiated, a timer will count down and once the boss is destroyed/killed before the timer reaches zero, then the time left will add to the player's end-level score; if the timer runs out, then the score at the end of the level will remain unaffected. Extends/1 Ups were awarded every 300,000 points.[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlaZeon[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Blues Brothers, The</title_clean>
				<plot>"Could have been a great deal better if it had anything to do with the movie..."[CR]I'm sure many of you reading this are familiar with the 1980 John Landis film following the adventures of Jake (John Belushi) and his brother Elwood (Dan Ackroyd) as they venture on a spiritual journey across the US to bring their blues band back together for a gig to save an orphanage from shutting down.[CR]If you picked up this game expecting find any of the great action and car chase sequences from the film, you're going to be very disappointed. Instead, Titus have cooked up a cookie cutter Mario platform clone that has nothing to do with the film except borrowing the lead characters. It's really nothing new if you have played the NES version which is just as awful and unrelated to the movie as this game.[CR]Story - 2/10[CR]At first looking at the game you may wonder, when the HELL did any of this happen in the movie? Well to put it simply, Jake and Elwood have had too much booze and not enough snooze, causing them to drift off to a hellish nightmare created inside the world of a jukebox, where they venture across bizarre worlds and fight strange cartoony creatures. It's a dream - a cop out excuse to make a platform game.[CR]Graphics/Presentation - 6/10[CR]I'll admit that I did find The Blues Brothers to be a vibrant and colorful game, upon starting the system you see a very bright pink title screen adorned with colorful musical notes. There isn't much of an introduction apart from seeing our hapless boys standing cheerfully in front of a jukebox before being zapped in. Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock and roll![CR]For the in game graphics - they're bright and colourful, reminding me of Super Mario World and a few other cute mascot platformers. Jake and Elwood are thankfully different characters rather than the usual palette swaps of the same character. The game scrolls smoothly as you travel across the pink sunset of the first area. It's typical 16-bit platformer fanfare, with nothing to really make you say WOW (not even a hint of scaling and rotation besides the character select screen). There is a great deal of recycled scenery - laziness on the artists part? or maybe the game was only programmed on an 8 meg cart.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] - 3/10[CR]Here's where the game really takes a dive. It's side scrolling platform action similar to the Mario games, minus the fun. Take your pick of Jake or Elwood (or both in co-operative 2 player) and get ready from some tedious platforming action. Make your way across the strange landscape while firing records at the various enemies that come your way.[CR]Apart from collecting records, cream pies can be attained that causes your player to turn buff ala Altered Beast, and you can jump higher and do more damage with your attacks. Get hit once and you lose the ability. Also along the way are mini Jukeboxes that give you temporary invincibility.[CR]While this may sound like fun, the gameplay is not as enjoyable as it sounds. The enemies have a habit of homing in and pestering you, and they respawn again if you happen to return to that part of the screen again. They come in the form of animated insects, lawn mowers, bear traps, bulldogs, and other odd animals. There is some sort of flying caterpillar you can ride in the few bonus stages that pop up, and it can be a hassle to control it.[CR]The platforming aspects are tougher than the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros 2 and you'll be cursing at the cheap deaths that will sneak up on you. The camera is also erratic, and can be a nuisance when you need to jump large spaces from mushroom to mushroom. I never did get around to finishing this game, as there are just too many stages to play in one sitting, and the scenery is repeated after the first few stages. Add in the tedious stage layout and annoying enemies and you have a game that isn't worth the effort of playing seriously.[CR]Multiplayer - 5/10[CR]If you do decide to play this game, you'll probably have more fun with another player. Venting your anger by firing your records at them and picking them up is fun, and you'll need to be in time with your friend to make the platform jumps as the game won't scroll without the other player following.[CR]Control - 6/10[CR]While the button layout is good, the character movement is a bit dodgy, and it can seem like you're travelling on ice sometimes as the players have a high skid factor after making them run.[CR]Soundtrack/Audio - 7/10[CR]Probably the game's only redeeming feature is the soundtrack. The sound effects are your standard cartoony samples, and a few voice clips from the movie made it in. The music is very good, apparently composed by some famous French dude.[CR]It's a selection of jazzy blues tunes with some tracks recreated from the movie. Sounds great for SNES music, although 7 tunes is far from adequate for a game that's main theme is music.[CR]Replayability - 3/10[CR]There's no reason to torture yourself by coming back to this game, after playing it for half an our you probably won't want to return, except maybe to mess around in the 2 player mode or listen to the music.[CR]Overall - 4/10[CR]Stay away from this pitiful platformer unless you're curious about the music or funny co-op. It's well drawn and the music is great, but it lacks any real gameplay value to justify a purchase. Then again, it probably costs around $5 or less on eBay, so you could always buy it just to add another title to your SNES collection. If you found this game awful, don't even thing of playing Blues Brothers 2000 on the N64, its practically the same as this game but in 3D.[CR]-Steven[CR]Reviewer's Score: 4/10, Originally Posted: 12/30/05[CR]Reviewer: Auction Sniper[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/snes/review/R95986.html[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Bobby's World</title_clean>
				<plot>This game is still under debate whether it was released or not. The game was competed, there is no doubt about it, and the rom image was dumped. The game was being released by a company called Hi Tech. It was being planned for release in early 1995.[CR]This game is based on the Howie Mandell cartoon of the same name. The story is that Bobby has to clean his room, and he has daydreams when he starts cleaning certain parts of his room. I decided to play this game until I got bored, and I ended up passing it, so here is a full review.[CR]Graphics: 6/10[CR]The graphics are ok, nothing that hasn't been seen on other snes games. The characters probably could have had more frames of animation, but there is a wide range of stages and enemies.[CR]Sound: 5/10[CR]Pretty bland. The music won't drive you crazy, but it is nothing special. The sound effects are also pretty plain, just appropriate, nothing more.[CR]Controls: 4/10[CR]The controls aren't that great. Bobby moves very slowly, and doesn't automatically respond to button presses.[CR]At one spot, you must swing from these three logs. This is the hardest part of the game, only because of the controls. I died maybe 3 times in this game, except for this point, where I died around 20 times (luckily I got pissed off after the first few deaths and used savestates). Nothing is more evil that deaths caused by poor controls.[CR]Overall Score: 4/10[CR]I played this game for about 40 minutes and I passed it. If it weren't for that stupid spot aforementioned above, this game offers little challenge. Part of the problem is that there were life power ups usually placed just in the spot where you are near death. It is nice that there is a bit of variety (every third stage or so it changes from a side scroller to a shooter type of game), but it was certainly made with children in mind. There were 3 bosses, but they were easily vanquished by staying in the top corner where they couldn't hit you (they all moved in the same pattern). I don't know if this would even satisfy fans of the show (if they exist). But any game that lasts only 40 minutes with no replay value doesn't really warrant release, and in this case, it seems that it didn't.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Final Stage[CR]Roger, Webbly, Kelly, Dad[CR]Reviewer: Evan G[CR]http://www.snescentral.com/article.php?id=0119[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Bonkers</title_clean>
				<plot>"Stupid cat..."[CR]Disney's Bonkers is not a very good game. I'll tell you that right now. It was never a well heard of game, and it never will be because the Super Nintendo has basically died. (Although it's still the best in my opinion ^_^) I'm not surprised at that fact, either. Most games that are well heard of are usually pretty good, with those few exceptions. This game isn't very good. While the graphics aren't horrible, the gameplay is not very original, and it's repetitive and boring. Not to mention the horrible control.[CR]Graphics: 6/10[CR]Well, I've seen worse. But I've definitely seen much better, too. At my first glance they looked really good, but they're lacking some detail that can easily be put in. Animation was not bad at all, either. Some nice animation always pops up here and there. For instance, when you stand in one place not moving for a while, then Bonkers, the cat-like main character looks at you and grabs his ears and stretches them. Dashing looks pretty good, too. Overall, there are some okay graphics, which Capcom could have made better very easily. Maybe they were just lazy...[CR]Audio: 1/10[CR]God, I never want to hear that annoying music ever again. This song has one single solitary track. That's right, you hear the same track over and over in every single level. And to put it bluntly, that track sucks. I never liked it from the first second I heard it, I still hate it, and I'm not going to like it anytime soon. After the first level, I just started to get a bit annoyed. By the time I finished two more levels, I was beyond annoyed. But by that time, I usually had the volume all the way down so that I wouldn't have to listen to that God-awful music anymore. *shiver*[CR]The sound wasn't impressive either. The only sounds I remember hearing are the sound of a balloon popping, Bonker's "Ouch!", and a little Shwing kind of sound when Bonkers dashes. (^_^) The balloon popping sound wasn't impressive at all, as it sounded rather scratchy to me and it didn't really sound too much like a balloon pop altogether. The other sounds weren't any better. When Bonker's says "Ouch!", it's not too bad at first, but you'll be hearing it way too often. After all, this game is pretty challenging, so you'll be getting hit at every corner. And I think you're smart enough to figure out that you hear his cry of pain at every corner as well. And then there's that dashing sound. As I mentioned, it makes a shwing kind of a sound. The most irritating thing to me about this was that it was very high pitched. It kind of hurts your ears. Nyuk![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]: 3/10[CR]There isn't anything that's radically different from every game you've ever played. It's a side scrolling game, so of course you have views in front of and behind you. There are some features, though. First off, the dashing feature is probably the biggest part of the gameplay, although it's not very big. There is an unnecessarily large meter at the bottom left corner of the screen that fills up slowly. When it fills up, you can press Y and hold the directional pad in the direction you want to dash in. This can be used to pop balloons or simply go faster. The balloons found all over the level can be popped and sometimes hold some things in them. For instance, when you find a red potion in a balloon and take it, Bonkers goes bonkers and turns red. When he's red, he dashes non-stop in any direction of your choice until your allotted time runs out. But these balloons usually hold police badges. [CR]Police badges are found everywhere all over a level. When you get ten of these badges, you can restore a heart. (In case you didn't get the hint, the amount of hearts is your life meter.) This is actually a very good thing, because you'll be needing lots of hearts, and badges come in groups all the time. It's really easy to get these badges, so you should always grab them.[CR]- Challenge: Fairly High[CR]Yeah, this game is hard. I found the first couple of levels pretty easy, but it gets much harder as it goes on. The enemies are unlimited. If a dog runs up to you and you stomp that mutt to shut it up, another one comes to you in a matter of seconds. They're all over the place! Not to mention the fact that you have to avoid a million little obstacles that seem so big while you're dealing with three bees flying over your head, 2 bulldogs trying to gnaw on your butt, and some walking candlesticks burning you into some ashes.[CR]- Control: Bad[CR]The control was seriously messed up. I found the controls to be very unresponsive. I seriously needed to press each button twice just to have that stupid cat jump in the air. This leads to some serious frustration. I honestly found myself yelling at the screen because I kept falling into some bad places, thus making me lose several times, and therefore I get very aggravated and yell at the screen.[CR]- Replay Value: Low[CR]I really don't feel that playing this game again is necessary. I didn't enjoy it the first time, and I can't see why playing it through a second time would make me enjoy it any more. I am not aware of any special levels, codes, etc. that are unlocked when you complete it, either. If there was, it might be worth playing to unlock them. But there isn't, and that's the end of story.[CR]Final Word[CR]Bonkers is not a game that I would recommend. I'm a big fan of the SNES and have played a ton of SNES games, and I can safely say that this doesn't come anywhere close to the top ones. It's much closer to the bottom. Try it only if you're bored, or are just dying to play another 16-bit game.[CR]Final Score: 3/10[CR]Reviewer's Score: 3/10, Originally Posted: 07/02/01, Updated 07/02/01[CR]Reviewer: BrakZero[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/snes/review/R19812.html[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Boogerman: A Pick and Flick Adventure is an action platformer that was initially released for Sega Genesis and SNES. Players control Snotty Ragsdale, an eccentric millionaire with a curious mind. Players burp, flick, fart, and spit their way through the dimension of X Crement. The game takes place in 5 different worlds of unique and disgusting themes; each world ends with a boss fight.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]On a dark and stormy night Professor Stinkbaum has built a device to rid the world of pollution.

You can either compete in an exhibition mode or play in career mode and become the greatest of all time.[CR]The set of punches in the game is pretty much standard, jab, hook, uppercut, even the ever popular but illegal low blow.  Also, for each round and every knockdown you score on an opponent, you get a super punch, a straight shot to the face and is almost unstoppable and connected right could knock out your opponent, but if you miss, you lose your punch for the round.[CR]There are two main displays during a fight, a damage inflict meter in the form of two boxing gloves, one on each side and as a player connects a punch, the glove will show a black area of where the glove connected and a damage meter that show's the two fighters faces.  As the round progresses, the fighter shows more bruises and cuts and starts to flash red when the fighter is getting tired and is the best time to land your super punch.[CR]Another feature is from round to round, your view will alternate, from looking over your shoulder to the next round and looking at yourself over your opponents shoulder.</plot>

				<title_clean>Brainies, The</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Brainies is a puzzle game with a simple goal: move each colored Brainy (Brainie?) to its correct marker in the time allotted. The player uses a cursor to move to a Brainy, pick them up, then move them to the right spot. The catch is that the Brainies block each other so puzzles sometimes require the player to move each Brainy many times in a level. A Brainy will also keep walking in one direction until they hit a wall or another Brainy. The goal is to use these limitations to direct each Brainy to their assigned markers before the time limit runs out.[CR]The game was released to many European home computers in 1991. It was later ported to the Super Nintendo in 1994 (1996 for the US version). Some of the European versions are known as Tiny Skweeks, alluding to the Skweek puzzle series.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bram Stoker's Dracula is a 1993 video game released as a tie-in based on the Francis Ford Coppola movie of the same name. In the game, the player takes on the role of Jonathan Harker, who must stop the vampire Dracula. Versions of the game were released for a multitude of platforms ranging from the Amiga and NES to the Sega CD and PC.[CR]There were numerous variations between each version, though they all played similarly and shared the protagonist Jonathan Harker.NES, Game Boy, Game Gear and Sega Master System[CR]The 8-bit and portable versions of the game skewed closer to standard platformers than the other console versions, with floating platforms and other standard platformer obstacles.SNES and Genesis[CR]The 16-bit versions were action games that focused more on combat and adventure game elements than platforming. The sprite used for Harker was larger, and the games had more enemies to face down.Sega CD and Amiga[CR]Similar to the SNES and Genesis, these versions were more action-oriented. They included FMV cutscenes from the movie and digitized backgrounds.DOS[CR]The Bram Stoker's Dracula for PC MS-DOS systems was a first-person shooter, taking after games like Doom and Wolfenstein 3D (or Blood and Heretic, which share similar gothic horror settings).[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Breath of Fire</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Breath of Fire was originally developed and released by Capcom in Japan in 1993 for the SNES, and a year later licensed by Squaresoft for release in North America. It was Capcom's first foray into the role-playing genre. The game was mostly well-received by critics, but was criticized for its linear story progression and frequent random enemy encounters.[CR]Capcom later released a GBA remake in 2001 that included some minor additions and tweaks to the game. Among these additions were new character portraits, new additional illustrated cutscenes, the ability to dash, and tweaks to the overall difficulty of the game. Players could also swap items between their inventories with the use of a game link cable.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Spurned by the evil goddess Tyr, the Light Dragon Clan and the Dark Dragon Clan had been at war for eons, destroying the land they once governed together. Out of the war-torn people arose a young hero and his seven companions. On a treacherous journey, they managed to capture Mila and seal her away in a dungeon locked with six keys. A fragile peace has since returned to the lands as the Light Dragons work to resolve differences with the Dark Dragons. Will the forces of Light and Dark return peace to the land, or will history repeat itself? Join Ryu and his companions as the future of the Dragon Clan unfolds.[CR]Main Characters[CR]RyuRyu[CR]The hero of this game. He is a boy from the light Dragon clan who lives with his sister Sara.

				<title_clean>Breath of Fire II</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Breath of Fire II (JP: Breath of Fire II: Shimei no Ko ("Breath of Fire II: Child's Mission")) is a turn-based RPG developed and published by Capcom. It was initially released for the Super Famicom in 1994 and saw localizations for the US and Europe the subsequent year. In 2002 the game was released on the Game Boy Advance with minor improvements, and the original SNES version was rereleased on the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007 and the Wii U eShop in 2013.[CR]It is sandwiched by 1993's Breath of Fire for the SNES and 1997's Breath of Fire III for the Sony PlayStation.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Breath of Fire II centres around Ryu Bateson, a young member of the Dragon Clan who is mysteriously separated from his adoptive father and sister at a young age. Orphaned and soon on the run with fellow orphan Bow, Ryu and his friend grow up to be Rangers: an organized form of mercenaries for hire. A job sets them on a path that will ultimately unravel the mystery of the Church of St. Eva, see them fighting against an imminent demonic invasion, and discover the hidden power locked within each of the game's characters.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]Ryu (nameable)Ryu[CR]The hero of the game. He is a member of he Dragon Clan. Unfortunately, takes the role of the silent protagonist, so has no personality. Over the course of the game, both Katt and Nina fall in love with him, though unlike the other Breath of Fire games, in which the hero always falls in love with a girl named Nina, the ending leaves it ambiguous which girl he chooses. Wields a broadsword in combat and can transform into a dragon for incredibly powerful attacks. His special combat ability is called Guts, and it restores Ryu's lost HP; the less he has, the more it heals, although it fails frequently. His special field ability allows him to participate in the fishing minigame.BowBow[CR]A young boy of the Windrunner Clan who becomes Ryu's best friend. A very talented thief who eventually gets caught up in unfortunate circumstances. Uses a crossbow in combat, and learns a little healing magic. His special combat ability, Shot, is just like his regular attack except that it will either deal a devastating blow to the enemy or only do 1 damage. His special field ability lets him participate in the hunting minigame, where he must try to shoot wild game (or monsters) with his crossbow, though he isn't very good at it since almost all creatures take more than one shot and will try to run away after the first one.KattKatt[CR]A member of the rare Woren Clan who joins the party. A warrior through and through, she develops feelings for Ryu after he becomes the first person to ever defeat her in combat, and she quickly becomes one of the two love interests. Wields a bo staff in combat, and has the highest agility of all the party members, though her defence is very low, which makes it unfortunate that her special combat ability, Dare, has her daring all present enemies to attack her, making it far more likely that they'll target Katt, even if other party members are on the brink of death. If hit in this way, Katt is guaranteed to counter-attack. Her field ability is the same as Bow's, letting her participate in the hunting minigame. Unlike Bow, who shoots game from a distance, Katt swings her staff directly in front of her, and while her reach is therefore limited, she kills targets in a single swing. Katt can also smash boulders that are blocking the party's path in the world map, a handy way for the developers to force the player to have Katt in the party at certain times.RandRand[CR]A member of the Shell Clan who helps the party out. He is a bit of a lazy goof from a farming village who left home to wander the world for no better reason than the fact that running a farm was difficult. He can't hit as hard or as fast as Katt, but his thick skin gives him the highest defence in the group. Wears brass knuckles as his weapon. His special combat ability, Wake, has him attacking a party member with a fraction of his usual strength. This damages them, but can also dispel status ailments like Sleep. Wake also has a chance, albeit a rather slim one, to resuscitate a KOed party member. His special field ability allows him to curl up into a ball and roll across the world map at a much faster speed than the party makes on foot. While random battles cannot occur during the roll itself, Rand cannot stop on his own, and must keep rolling until he runs into something, be it a wall, coast, or town, at which point it is likely the party will get into a battle.NinaNina[CR]An exiled Windian Princess from the Wing Clan. Her wings are black (although they're clearly purple in-game and in most concept art), and a member of the royal family of Windia having black wings is such a bad omen that tradition demanded that the baby be put to death. Instead her mother the Queen arranged for Nina to be smuggled out of the country, though while she lives, the royal family refuses to officially acknowledge her as a princess. Nina develops feelings for Ryu after he saves her from the Joker gang, and becomes the other love interest. Her weapon is a magic ring that shoots bolts of energy, though as an offensive magic specialist, she almost never has to use it. Her special combat ability is Will, which functions much the same as Ryu's Guts, except that instead of restoring Nina's HP, it restores her AP (ability points). Her special field ability makes the party impervious to pit traps; if Nina is at the front of the party, and they fall into a hole, Nina will immediately fly the party back up using her wings. Later in the game, Nina also gains the ability to summon the Great Bird of Windia, which can fly the party around the world.StenSten[CR]A once proud Highland warrior, he left his home voluntarily after a great war, now he performs magic tricks on the street to stay alive. Uses a dagger in combat and relies more on speed than strength or defence to make his mark. However, since he isn't as strong as Ryu, fast as Katt, or tough as Rand, Sten gets sidelined by most players. His special combat ability, RIP, allows him to play dead, which means he cannot be targeted by enemies, although he still makes a regular attack against an enemy of the player's choice. However, if Sten is the last member left standing and he tries to use RIP, the enemy will target him anyway and he'll take more damage than usual. His field ability lets the party cross certain narrow cliff faces by having Sten reach across with his long Highlander arms. This is only story-necessary a few times, but several areas have optional shortcuts that Sten can access in this way.JeanJean[CR]Full name "Ekaru Hoppe de pe Jean". He is the Prince of Simafort, the home of the froglike Creeping Clan. Jean is fairly happy-go-lucky, and his foppish, devil-may-care attitude makes him seem rather stupid, but he has a good heart, and does his best to help his friends and family. Wields a rapier, though some swords can be used by both Jean and Ryu. While Jean's noble spirit sees him through in the storyline, his stats are all garbage except for luck, so he is rarely used in battle. His special combat ability, Jab, has him attack all enemies at once, but he does much less damage per enemy than he would with a regular attack, which isn't that much anyway. His field ability lets him transform into a giant (non-anthropomorphic) frog, and carry the group around the map. This is partially useful because he moves two spaces with every hop, so the chance of random battles is halved, but mainly because he can swim like this, and get the party across land-locked bodies of water (the ocean being too rough for a mere frog).SparSpar[CR]A Grass Man who is held captive in a circus cage. Uncomfortably androgynous and mostly without emotion, Spar can speak to trees and plants to gain information, and wields a vine whip in battle, though he's better at defensive magic than at combat. His special combat ability, Nature (rendered as "Ntre" due to the game's absurd four-character limit), allows him to call upon the strength of a mysterious nature spirit named Green. If Green responds (and he often doesn't), it will have a magical effect on the battle that depends on the background; if the party is in the desert, nearby cacti will suddenly explode and damage the enemy, or if the party is in an open field, flowers may bloom and release pollen that lowers the enemies' defence, etc. It cannot work in areas without plantlife such as caves or manmade areas. His field ability allows him to "walk through" dense forests, representing his innate knowledge of the layout of the trees.Bleu (Secret Character)Bleu [CR]It's Bleu from the original Breath of Fire. She can be re-recruited if her secret home in the desert is found, and if the player speaks to her spirit guardians. She is in fact disguised as a human at the Magic School in Hometown, and if spoken to after the player meets her guardians, she will drop her disguise and forcefully join the party. Her weapon, just as it was in the original game, is a magical rod, though she should rely on her powerful offensive magic instead, which is slightly stronger than even Nina's. While characters in the original Breath of Fire didn't have special combat abilities, here she's gained one called Shed, in which she sheds her skin, which restores her HP to maximum and dispels negative status ailments, although it lowers her defense. As per her status as a secret character, unlike Ryu's Guts or Nina's Will, Shed works perfectly 100% of the time. Bleu, like Bow and Katt, can participate in the hunting minigame through her special field ability, though hers is literally a joke; she lifts her rod, casts a fire spell, and instantly incinerates all creatures on screen. This would seem to be handy except that instead of leaving behind useful meat, all creatures killed in this manner drop useless charcoal.[CR]Other Characters[CR]People who Ryu meets along the way who do not join the party.Ganer[CR]Ryu and Yua's father. He serves as a Priest of the Church of St. Eva in Gate until his mysterious disappearance.Yua[CR]Ryu's little sister. She disappears along with her father shortly after the game begins.Patty the Phantom Thief[CR]A mysterious girl who frames Bow for a robbery in the beginning of the game. Heavily implied to be Ryu's sister Yua, all grown up.Valerie[CR]Ryu and Yua's absent mother, and a member of the Dragon Clan. She was believed to have died protecting the village from an attack, but eventually Ryu finds out the truth.Princess Mina[CR]Nina's younger sister, and the only member of her family that still acknowledges Nina's existence. She is also the current Crown Princess of Windia.Ray[CR]An exceptionally devoted member of the St. Eva's church, whose strong faith gives him superhuman abilities. An occasional ally to the group.[CR]Shamans and Fusion[CR]During the course of the game the player will be able to seek out Shamans. These (mostly) lovely women will be able to fuse with the party characters and improve their stats. It can also drastically change the characters' appearance as well. Ryu cannot form any Fusions at all, because as a member of the Dragon Clan, he is incompatible with their magic. However, the first time they attempt to fuse with him, they unlock his inherited ability to transform into a dragon. Bleu is also immune to Fusion, but this is likely just because she is a secret character.[CR]The Shamans from left to right are:[CR]Solo (Shaman of Earth), Seny (Holy Shaman), Shin (Devil Shaman), Seso (Shaman Of Water), Sana (Shaman of Fire), Spoo (Shaman of Wind),Fusion[CR]When mixing certain Shamans with the party characters, sometimes they will drastically change:Nina x Seny x Spoo = Angelic NinaJean x Seny = Dark Prince JeanKatt x Shin = Dark Martial Artist KattSten x Sana x Spoo = Sten JinniRand x Solo x Sana = Small and Cute RandBow x Seny x Shin = Robo-BowSpar x Seso = Girly SparSpar x Sana x Shin = Snapdragon SparSpar x Solo = Spar Sprout[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Old Friends[CR]At Giant Island, in the northern area of the map above the town Gate (Press select for the map), you'll find Bo and Karn from the first Breath of Fire game. They don't do anything though, but you can talk to them. You'll need the whale or the bird to get there though.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Infinite Healing Items or Gold Coins[CR]After you have the carpenter build the house for the old lady that unites shamans, go to the northeastern house where the carpenter cooks. Talk to the carpenter and he'll tell you he can cook anything. In the item selection screen use two herbs to make a HelpBL four to make an Elixer. Now to make it infinte, next use either four HelpBL's or two elixers to make a LifePL. So that would mean that you used 8 hervs for a total of 64gp to make one LifePL for a total of 250gp. So sell your LifePL's to make alot of money, buy more herbs and do it again!</plot>

				<title_clean>Brett Hull Hockey</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Brett Hull Hockey is a licensed ice hockey game featuring the famous hockey player Brett Hull, who at the time was playing for the St. Louis Blues. The rest of the season rosters for 1994 are also included, as the game is licensed by the NHLPA (National Hockey League Players' Association), but are only referred to by their jersey numbers by the announcer. Like EA's NHL franchise, the game depicts the rink from a vertical perspective. It also makes use of low-res movie clips.[CR]Brett Hull Hockey was released on the Super Nintendo and PC MS-DOS in 1994. A Genesis version was planned but canceled. Brett Hull Hockey '95 was an incrementally improved sequel that was released the following year.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] CPUs Goalie Disappears[CR]In the pause menu, select the Goalie option. Press Right on controller two, and the opponent's goalie option will be "On Bench", though the change isn't seeable. Resume the game and the opponent's goalie won't be there!</plot>

				<plot>In this bowling game, players create a bowler in order to play against eleven professional bowlers. Players can choose their bowler's clothes, what hand they use to bowl, the spare ball and primary ball they want to use, and also the weight of the balls.[CR]The game offers practice, tournament, and league modes. Practice mode is just a quick game of bowling by yourself. In league mode, players can either compete by themselves or as a team against other bowlers. Finally, the tournament mode features six different tournaments to compete in. A short or long tournament determines the number of players that will be involved in the tourney.[CR]Before hitting the lanes, the player will be informed of the oil pattern of the lane which tells the player how the ball will react to that lane. Bowling is performed by choosing where to stand, then using the two meters that determine the amount of power and spin the ball will have when it's finally released down the lane.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Password[CR]Enter TWCO as a password on the password screen to play the Brunswick Tournament .</plot>

				<plot>The Dalai Llama (bad pun or what?) has organised a martial arts contest for animals of all species to prove their skills, and you are competing in it. There are a wide variety of furry creatures to take on, and finally the Dalai Llama himself. [CR]Brutal: Paws of Fury is a standard one-on-one beat 'em up across a variety of levels, with mostly outdoor terrain. You can choose of the many characters. Throughout the game, your character travels across Dalai Llama's island, fighting a series of duels before getting to the final showdown. [CR]During a duel, you can punch and kick your opponent, try to use special attacks on him/her, or use a "taunt" that restores a bit of your health. Each battle lasts a number of rounds (how many - that is determined in the options menu); once one combatant has won that number of times during the battle, he wins. If the computer-controlled player won, it's game over (but you can still use a continue to start the fight anew); if you won, you move on to the next opponent. Once you have defeated them, you can watch an ending animation, different depending on the character you have chosen. [CR]Instead of beginning a whole new game, you can fight a single duel, choosing the opponent and terrain. You can choose to fight either a computer-controlled opponent or another human player. [CR]The visuals are leant towards cutesiness, which makes a change from the gore of Mortal Kombat and the metal of Rise of the Robots.[CR]In the console versions, you start the game without special moves, but get a new one after each successful best-of-three bout. The computer versions drop this feature, though.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Character ability passwords[CR]After the title screen select start game and then enter password.</plot>

The sequel to Bubsy: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind, Bubsy II puts players back in the role of Bubsy, the wise-cracking anthropomorphic bobcat, as he sets off through the Amazatorium (a museum full of portals to different worlds) to defeat the tyrannical anthropomorphic pig leader, Oinkton P. Hamm.[CR]Unlike the previous game, Bubsy can enter any of the six worlds he wants to at any time (with the exception of the last world, which must be unlocked by completing the other five). He also now has a health system (in which he can take up to three hits from normal enemies before he dies, unless he finds a special healing item) and multiple gadgets that can be purchased by collecting trading cards (such as a "smart bomb", a diving suit, a cartoonish black hole to hide in, and ammo for his toy weapon). Score-giving yarnballs are now replaced with marbles, and the "Woolies" are replaced with various baddies.[CR]A handheld version was released for the Game Boy in 1995.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]Enter the following codes on the title screen:</plot>

				<title_clean>Bubsy in - Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind (known in Japan as Yamaneko Bubsy no Daibouken, translated to The Adventures of Bubsy Wildcat) is a 2D platformer developed and published by Accolade for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis in 1993. This pun-filled game stars an anthropomorphic wise-cracking bobcat named Bubsy, as he tries to stop enemy aliens (called Woolies) from stealing Earth's supply of yarn balls.[CR]The game later spawned a series of platformers (ending with Bubsy 3D). An enhanced version for the PC, titled Super Bubsy, was released in 1995. Super Bubsy contained upscaled graphics, new sound effects, and the unsuccessful pilot episode for the Bubsy animated series.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game plays like a traditional 2D sidescrolling platformer similar to Sonic the Hedgehog. Players run through levels, attempting to reach the end of the level (before the time runs out) while eliminating enemies, gaining score, collecting powerups, and avoiding deadly obstacles. The game includes fifteen main levels (called "chapters") split up into six main areas (ranging from forests to the Wild West) and one final level (set in space).[CR]Bubsy has two abilities at his disposal: jumping (by pressing the Jump button) and gliding (by pressing the Glide button). Gliding reduces his downward falling speed, and activating it at the right time before bouncing up allows Bubsy to be propelled much higher than usual.[CR]Running into enemies, touching deadly obstacles (such as water, spiked pits), and fall damage can kill Bubsy in one hit (as he has no health system whatsoever). However, jumping or gliding onto enemies can eliminate them (getting them out of Bubsy's way while giving the player score). Due to the difficulty, there are plenty of checkpoints (for Bubsy to respawn at) and extra lives (as if starting with nine lives, like the cat mythology, is easy enough) scattered around levels.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Debug Mode, Stage Select, Sound Test and Sprite Viewer Mode[CR]At the title screen, enter the "1st Enable Code" sequence. If done right, a fanfare will be heard and the music will get really loud. Now, enter the next three codes one after the other (it's mandatory to enter all the codes). If done right, the music will go back to normal and it will restart each time a code is entered correctly (if you make a mistake, you'll have to start all over again). Now, you can do two things:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Debug Mode, Stage Select, Sound Test and Sprite Viewer Mode[CR] 1) on the title screen, you can press Up or Down on controller 2 to select levels (don't go below level 1 or above 21 or the game will crash), or press Right/Left to select levels in increments of 3. You can also press B to make the computer play the level for you.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Debug Mode, Stage Select, Sound Test and Sprite Viewer Mode[CR]2) start the game and while playing, press R + Select to enable the debug menu. You can use the crosspad to move around the stage, Select or R to move bit by bit, A or Y to increase or decrease the selected item, X to place an object and L to delete an object. Also, while the debug is enabled and after moving around a bit, press L + Select to enable the Sound Test and Sprite Viewer. You can press Up and Down with B or X to play different songs, or press Left and Right with A or Y to play different sound effects.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bubsy Passwords[CR]Level - Codes[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bubsy Passwords[CR]The Japanese version uses different passwords than the English version, and like the English version not all of them all revealed ingame.Push Select on the title screen to enter the options screen. Select the "Enter password" option and push Select, then use the D-Pad to enter and push Select when finished. The password option will change to display the level number if you entered it right. Push Start to play.</plot>

				<title_clean>Cacoma Knight in Bizyland</title_clean>
				<plot>The people of Bizyland were hard-working and prosperous. However, Wagamama, the queen of Lasyland was jealous and used the power of her magic mirror. The spell that was cast would switch the realms of Bizyland and Lasyland around. The only people left unaffected by the spell were those who were not hard-working: notably the king of Bizyland as well as two children and a robot who were playing that day. Using the king's magic chalk, they must travel over Lasyland and restore enough of a percentage of each area so as to break the spell over each region.[CR]Cacoma Knight is a puzzle-painting game. Choosing one of the three characters, the player will begin each level only able to move around the edges. The player can start using the chalk to move away from the edges and draw a line over the darkened area and reach another edge. Once a section (always the smaller) is "chalked off" from the rest, it will be restored. Any treasure chests revealed will be opened for points bonuses. Different enemies will walk along the chalk lines or fly in between them. They can be destroyed by being in a section of the screen when it is restored.</plot>

An 'iron man' in the majors, playing in over 1,600 consecutive games. When Cal plays, he plays for real! Cal Ripken Jr. Baseball brings that realism home. You'll get unequalled animation, accurate strategy-logic and players that respond to real game situations. You also get all-new, all-star features you won't find anywhere else: Choose your home field -domed, traditional outdoor or one tailored to power hitters. Play on natural grass or artificial turf and get accurate game play effects. Watch cutaway camera angles for realistic close-ups of the game action. Use Cal as a pinch-hitter for either team during the game - or create an 'all-Cal' team that can challenge the best of them.</plot>

				<title_clean>California Games II</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]California Games II is the sequel to 1988's hit, California Games, and a part of Epyx's overarching "Games" series, including Summer Games and Winter Games. California Games II was released in 1990 for the Amiga, and later for several other systems, including MS-DOS, Sega Master System, SNES, and Atari ST. The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible in five different events.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]One of the game's five events.[CR]Just like in California Games, there are several events that the player can play through. In California Games II, these five events are hang gliding, jet skiing, body boarding, snowboarding, and skateboarding. The player completes each of the five events sequentially, and then is awarded a point total at the end, depending on the player's performance throughout the events.EventsHang Gliding[CR]Hang gliding puts the player in control of a hang glider flying over the ocean. The goal in this game is to drop water balloons in three different tubes, each of which yields points, all while avoiding prematurely falling in the water.Jet Skiing[CR]In the jet skiing minigame, the goal is to complete a course as fast as possible. The player is giving buoy guidelines to follow, as well as time-reducing checkpoints and ramps. If the player fails to complete it in time, they are still awarded points, but less so than a fully completed course would yield.Body Boarding[CR]In the bodysurfing event, the player is put in control of a character swimming in the ocean. The goal is to do tricks off of a large wave in order to gain points. Failure to complete tricks, or falling off of the wave results in penalization for the player.Snowboarding[CR]Snowboarding starts the player off in the middle of a slope. The goal here is to avoid obstacles for as long as possible, and to hit the ramp at the end of the cliff face. Unlike other games, the player is given several falls before the event is failed completely.Skateboarding[CR]Hearkening to games such as Skate or Die, the skateboarding minigame puts the player in control of a skater on a half-pipe course, going through tunnels and doing tricks along the way.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Choose from 1 of 8 different racers who compete on 8 different bicycle race courses. The game splits the courses into different stages, with each stage having a requirement to move on to the next stage. The requirements are based on completing a set number of laps or attaining a certain score, except for the final race where the player must come in 1st place in 30 laps. [CR]There are also a number of selectable mountain bikes which are rated in the categories of turning, speed, tires, acceleration, and shocks. During a race, players can punch opposing cyclists and also jump ramps. The higher the position the player comes in at the end of a race, the higher the score the player will receive.[CR]It was also re-released as a part of the SNES game Exertainment Mountain Bike Rally / Speed Racer as the Mountain Bike part of it, along with another game. It contains the same gameplay with only a few minor graphical changes.</plot>

				<title_clean>Captain America and the Avengers</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Arcade Title Screen[CR]Captain America and the Avengers is an 1991 Arcade brawler from Data East, later ported to the NES, SNES, Genesis, Game Gear and Game Boy. Data East handled the Genesis version themselves, though the SNES, Game Boy and Game Gear versions were licensed out to Mindscape who contracted Realtime Associates the develop the games. The NES game plays a little differently, more of a standard platformer game, and doesn't have as many playable characters.[CR]Taking control of one of the classic (1980s-90s) Marvel Avengers, the player battles their way through five levels in order to prevent Red Skull from carrying out his nefarious plan. The player(s), as either Captain America, Iron Man, Vision, or Hawkeye, fights their way through cities, space, and even underwater. Occasionally other Avengers show up to help the team: Quicksilver by bringing health, Wonderman with a hover craft (for the two Avengers not capable of flight), Namor with a diving suit, and The Wasp becomes an auxiliary attack.[CR]Marvel villains Whirlwind, Grim Reaper, Mandarin, The Juggernaut, Crossbones, and, of course, Red Skull all make appearances as well as quite a few others (including what looks like a Sentinel from the X-Men universe).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Each hero has a similar set of abilities. There are two jump attacks (one if the player taps jump and attack, the other for holding jump and then pressing attack), they can dash at enemies to knock them down, a projectile (laser weapons for The Vision and Iron Man, arrows for Hawkeye, and Captain America's shield), and a series of punches and kicks followed by a throw.Iron Man is so lazy.[CR]Every couple of levels the brawling action is broken up with side-scrolling shooter sequences. There are three of these: one in space, one underwater, and one in a war-torn city.[CR]The levels are two miscellaneous cities, underwater, a secret underwater base, and the moon.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Captain Commando</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Captain Commando is an arcade beat-em-up developed and released by Capcom for arcades (running on CPS-1 hardware) on September 28, 1991. The game stars a futuristic superhero named Captain Commando (originally the fictional spokesman for Capcom USA's console games during the late 1980s) who, along with his three Commando Companions, must protect the Galaxy from super-powered criminals. These companions include the Mummy Commando (Mack the Knife, a mummy-like alien from outer space, known in the Japanese version as Jennety), the Ninja Commando (Ginzu the Ninja, a highly-trained ninja, known in the Japanese version as Sho), and the Baby Commando (Baby Head, a super genius infant who uses a robot of his own design, known in the Japanese version as Hoover).[CR]The gameplay builds upon Capcom's previous brawler, Final Fight, by including four-player simultaneous multiplayer, firearms as usable weaponry, and allowing the player to run (and perform running attacks). The game received a port to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1995 (restricting the amount of players that can be played simultaneously to two players) and the PlayStation in 1998 (for Japan only, keeping the four-player simultanenous multiplayer with the use of multitap hardware). The game was also released in two compilations: Capcom Classics Collection Remixed (for the PSP in March 22, 2006) and Capcom Classics Collection: Volume 2 (for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 in November 24, 2006).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The first stage.[CR]Captain Commando was a one to four player Co-Op game, each player has an eight-way joystick and two buttons. Like other Capcom beat'em ups such as Final Fight and Cadillacs and Dinosaurs, the player has a special move that can be done by pressing the attack and jump button. An original element to the beat'em up formula, was the dash mechanic that is done by tapping forward twice; it is useful for getting out of dangerous situations. The player can also perform a dash attack, or dash jump attack; for example, Captain Commando could unleash his flamethrower upon enemies.[CR]Other means of defense are presented for the player. Combat vehicles - armored mechs - can be used, each mech has a certain ability; one mech can freeze enemies while another can set them on fire. Weapons like melee and firearms also appear. Some weapons that are available are missile launcher, M-16, ray gun, throwing ninja stars, giant mallet and many others can be use.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Captain Novolin</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sponsored by Novo Nordisk, makers of the Novolin-brand insulin, Captain Novolin is an                          educational                            SNES platformer that was released in 1992, intent on teaching players on                           diabetes. In fact, the eponymous           protagonist, a                superhero, has diabetes himself. The game follows Captain Novolin's mission to save the mayor of Pineville (also a diabetic) from the alien Blubberman. To make matters worse, the mayor can only survive forty-eight hours without insulin. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Before each level, the game--with the help from a couple of                      doctors--goes through what Captain Novolin should eat and avoid depending on the meal and time of day. The player must then check his glucose level and inject insulin into his blood stream. Speedboat jumpingThe game plays like a standard platformer that plays from left to right. Enemies (aliens disguised as "sugary junk", like                            candy, chewing gum, and                        donuts) come from the right, and usually either run, jump, or   fly towards the player. They can be avoided with well-timed                         jumps and dashes or stomped on, and being hit by them will cause Captain Novolin to lose               health. Occasionally, Captain Novolin rides a                       speedboat, but this doesn't change the fundamental basics (Novolin can still jump with the speedboat) besides the fact that you're constantly moving forwards.     Littered throughout each level are various foods. The type of foods depend on the time of day. For example,                           bananas and     cereal crop up in the morning, while                           chicken and potatoes appear at night. A suitable amount of these healthy foods must be picked up to keep Captain Novolin's glucose level stable; too many, and the character will fall onto the ground, face down, unconscious (and one life is lost) with a message informing the player that his blood glucose level is too high. Players can earn bonus points by answering multiple choice questions about diabetes correctly at                    checkpoints.   Each level is also                          linear with no alternate paths or hidden levels. At the climax, the player must defeat the only             boss in the game--the            antagonist Blubberman, who throws           pies--before saving the mayor. [CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR] A donut-disguised alienCaptain Novolin is regarded as one of the worst games on the SNES, with many people citing the shallow and repetitive gameplay as the main reason. However, given its educational purpose, it is unlikely that the developer made gameplay its highest priority.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Carrier Aces is a 3rd person flight simulator that takes place during World War II. The game is also entirely split screen, with a second player or the computer opponent taking the controls on the second half of the secreen. Players control an aircraft pilot of either the United States or Japanese Empire. Based aboard an aircraft carrier, the player can engage in the following missions: 1vs1 dogfights, strafing runs on enemy ships, dive bombing on enemy ships, torpedo runs on enemy ships and carrier landings. All missions are made up of these elements, however campaign missions also feature the ability to decide which aircraft to bring into battle, each with it's own statistics, and keep track of progress on an area map. When two forces engage each other on this map, players can choose which plane to bring into battle and it will close in a 1vs1 battle with the enemy. In dogfights, both players control an aircraft whereas during ship combat, one player controls an aircraft and the other will control the ship's turret gun. Aircraft controls include being able to tilt left and right, climb, dive, increase speed, decrease speed, fire guns, release bombs/torpedoes (if present) and do a 180 degree loop. Turret controls are more limited, only allowing the player to aim left and right, fire the gun and zoom.</plot>

				<title_clean>Castlevania - Dracula X</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Richter Belmont, the game's main protagonist[CR]Castlevania: Dracula X (known in Europe as Castlevania: Vampire's Kiss and in Japan as Devil's Castle Dracula XX) is an action horror platformer developed and published by Konami for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in September 1995.[CR]Based on the PC-Engine Super CD-ROM&#178; game Castlevania: Rondo of Blood (originally Japanese-exclusive), the game shares most of its graphics, gameplay, storyline, and music. However, some components (such as the levels) were completely redesigned.[CR]Taking place sometime in 1792 (one hundred years after the events of the original Castlevania, the player controls Richter Belmont, descendant of Simon Belmont, as he sets out to seal the fate of Count Dracula while rescuing his beloved Annette Renard (along with her sister, Maria).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Castlevania: Dracula X plays like a traditional Castlevania game. Players guide Richter through seven stages, increasing their score by defeating enemies and collecting bags of money (dropped by enemies or destroying scenery). Players will also find heart-shaped jewels, which serve as ammunition for Richter's sub-weapons and super attacks (known as "Item Crashes"). Unlike Super Castlevania IV, released four years earlier, the player cannot do any special tricks with his Vampire Killer whip (such as whip in eight directions, hold out the whip freely to block projectiles, and use the whip to grapple onto special points). However, Richter can perform a backflip dodge (by double-tapping the jump button). Richter can also maintain his position while getting hit simply by crouching (preventing him from being knocked back), and can jump on and off stairs (by holding up or down on the d-pad and pressing the jump button).[CR]Other than jewels and bags of money, players can also find pendants (which clears the screen of all enemies), transparency elixirs (which grant Richter temporary invulnerability), and food (which restores some of Richter's health). Defeating a boss causes a Mystic Sphere to drop from the sky, refilling Richter's health completely and clearing the stage. Players earn extra lives by finding 1-Up items scattered throughout the game and clearing stages without getting hit, as well as for every time the player earns 20,000 points.Sub-Weapons/Item Crashes[CR]Along the way, Richter can pick up unique sub-weapons that consume the jewel meter for a special attack (performed by holding up on the directional pad and pressing the attack button). Richter can also perform "Item Crushes", which sacrifice more jewels for a super attack (by pressing the special Item Crush button). All of the sub-weapons and Item Crushes perform like they did in Castlevania: Rondo of Blood. However, this game is missing the Holy Bible sub-weapon. Dagger - At the cost of one jewel, Richter throws three very fast (but very weak) daggers. The Item Crush, at the cost of 10 jewels, produces a rapid stream of daggers. Axe - At the cost of one jewel, Richter tosses an axe in the air in an arced path (going through both walls and enemies). The Item Crash, at the cost of 10 jewels, causes Richter to float up in the air and produce a circle of axes that fan out around him. Holy Cross - At the cost of one jewel, Richter throws a cross-shaped object forward, which will return in the other direction like a  boomerang, damaging enemies along the way. The Item Crash, at the cost of 15 jewels, causes the screen to be bombarded with large crucifixes.Holy Water rain! Holy Water - At the cost of three jewels, Richter throws a bottle of holy water on the ground, creating a small area-of-effect attack with the flames it creates. Its Item Crash, at the cost of 20 jewels, causes holy water to rain from the sky all over the screen. Pocket Watch - At the cost of five jewels, Richter freezes most enemies in their place for five seconds. The Item Crash, at the cost of 30 jewels, grants Richter a temporary shield of pocket watches (causing a lot of damage when inflicted upon enemies). Key - Found in Stage 3, it is used for unlocking certain doors (allowing the player to rescue Annette and Maria). The Item Crash, which can only be performed if Richter has 15 jewels or more (it does not consume any jewels), causes Richter to hold the key out in front of him, causing major damage at the cost of its close range.[CR]Pressing the Item Crush button without carrying a sub-weapon causes Richter to throw a giant flaming whip attack (at the cost of 15 jewels).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra 1-ups[CR]To get an extra 1-up, beat each stage without getting hit. If you come out unscathed (no, you cannot get hit and eat a frankfurter), you will recieve a 1-up after every stage you complete.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra 1-ups[CR]After collecting the Key item which goes into your sub-weapon box in Stage 3, if you have 15 hearts or more, use the ItemCrash button. While to most people it seems to do nothing more than make a question mark appear over your head, if the key itself makes contact with an enemy or boss during this brief animation, they'll sustain heavy damage. The best part of this secret is while you must have 15 hearts or more to enable the itemcrash, actually using it consumes ZERO hearts allowing the attack to be used continuously! It also has the highest attack power killing most enemies in a single hit even if used regularly as well (Up + Attack) and once again consumes no hearts however to balance it's attack power, it's also the closest range "weapon" in the game needing to be used immediately in front of the enemy.</plot>

				<title_clean>Championship Pool</title_clean>
				<plot>Championship Pool is a pool game where players can 8-ball or 9-ball pool tournament that starts off with the BCA Regional Championship where the player must defeat 32 opponents in a first to four games match. If the player loses against any of the 32 opponents, they are then eliminated from the tournament. The winner of that then goes onto the World Championship.[CR]All of the gameplay is done from a top down view of the table. The player moves an icon to indicate location they want to hit the ball too. To aid in the aiming, a ghost of the cue ball and the first ball that is hit is repetitively played out to show the path of the hit ball. With the all the shots there is a very small margin of error, but this is only notable when a long shot is played or a shot from a sharp angle and the ghost balls will randomly play out all the possible occurrences. The player can also change the power and spin of the played shot with the ghost balls will updating to show the outcome of those changes. [CR]There are 4 different game modes that can be chosen, each with a different set of pool games. The different game modes and there games are:[CR]1. Tournament: The player must defeat 32 different players in a first to four knockout tournament in 8-ball or 9-ball pool before going on to the World Championship. During the tournament the opponent is never actually is seen playing there shots. Instead, when it is the opponents turn, it cuts to an image of the player with a caption and then returns the control to the player with some balls removed and moved. This way the opponent can finish the game within 4 turns regardless of if they where snookered or not.[CR]2. Challenge:  It has many different pool games that are played, all with one player without an opponent. The games are:[CR]1. 14.1 Challenge  After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. At that point, the player can hit any ball but once the fails to hit a ball in a hole the game is over. If there is only one ball left on the table the rest of the balls are re-racked and play continues. At the end score is given based on the number of balls that where hit in the holes. The score are tallied up over 5 games to get the total score.[CR]2. Eight Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit all the chosen set of balls (stripes or solids) and the 8-ball in one turn.  The score is based on how many balls where hit in.[CR]3. Nine Ball - After the break the ball is placed anywhere at the top of the table behind the line. The player must hit the 9 ball in one turn. The score is based on how many balls where hit in.[CR]4. Equal Offence  Same as 14.1 Challenge but there is only one game played.[CR]5. Three Pool  Only have 3 balls on the table. Score is based on how many shots it takes to get all three balls in with lower been better.[CR]6. Speed Pool  Objective is to hit all the balls in as quickly as possible as a timer is timing how long the game takes. Any ball can be hit at any time and the player can miss the shot and not be penalised (other than taking longer).[CR]3. Party:  It has many different multiplayer pool games that are played with ether just 2 or 2 to 8 human players. The games are:[CR]1. Eight Ball (2 Players)   A standard eight ball game with the players taking turns to play.[CR]7. Nine Ball (2-8 Players)   A standard nine ball game with up to 8 players taking turns. First player to get the 9-ball in wins.[CR]8. 14.1 Continuous (2 Players)   Players can hit any ball in for a point. If a shot is missed then other player plays. If there is only one ball on the table the pocketed balls are re-racked. Play continues until one of the players reaches the score chosen at the start of the game.[CR]9. Ten Ball (2-8 Players)   Same as Nine Ball except with 10 balls.[CR]10. Rotation (2-8 Players)   Only the lowest ball can be hit and the score for getting a ball in is the value of the ball (e.g. 8-ball is 8 points). Player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.[CR]11. Straight Pool (2 Players)    Same as 14.1 Continuous but the player with the highest score after one game wins.[CR]12. Equal Offence (2-8 Players)    Same as Equal Offence in challenge mode but players can take turns to beat each others score.[CR]13.

				<title_clean>Championship Soccer '94</title_clean>
				<plot>The first football (soccer to you Americans; how come your game called football features virtually no kicks, and even then only from 2 designated players?) game to challenge the supremacy of the Kick Off series. The graphical view is from a distance overhead, making the players small on screen but making around half the pitch visible. [CR]The basic control system involves loose control, making running with the ball (dribbling in football parlance) a skill to master, and putting the emphasis on  one-touch passing, which can be easily performed by tapping the fire button.[CR]The game features customisable league and cup competitions as well as pre-set ones including the 1992 European Championships. There are 168 teams in total, 40 European nations, the 64 top club sides, and 64 custom teams with names ranging from self-indulgent to comical, and their details are fully editable. At club and country level, each team has 3 star players who are more gifted that the others, use them wisely.</plot>

				<title_clean>Chester Cheetah - Too Cool to Fool</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR]Story   [CR]  Chester Cheetah  is being held against his will in the Four Corners Zoo by the  zookeeper, Mean Eugene. Chester Cheetah   orders a motorcycle from a  catalogue to help him escape from the zoo, but Mean Eugene intercepts  the package and hides the parts around the zoo. With the help of his  friends, The Hip-O and Funky Monkey, Chester must find the parts to his  motorcycle so he can "ditch this zoo and ride away to Hip City, USA."  Too Cool to Fool's illustrious cast of characters. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool is a fairly straightforward platformer with the only actions available to the player being walk, run and jump. Enemies are dazed (occasionally killed) by being jumped on. Extra lives are gained by collecting one hundred Paw Badges. The factor that differentiates Too Cool to Fool from other platformers is the objective of having to find a motorcycle part in each level. The player can find the exit to each level, but they can't use it until they have found the motorcycle part. [CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]There are five stages in Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool each with a different theme and different enemies.Stage 1: Four Corners Zoo Park  My God it's full of sewers!  This stage starts with Chester chilling on a bench when Mean Eugene and Grunt, his dog, run by with a box full of Chester's motorcycle parts. Chester leaps off the bench and hops into action. This appears to be an entirely flat plane with a few areaa, but the majority of it takes place underground in a maze of sewer pipes. Stage 2: Monkey Pits This stage has a jungle theme and is a fairly vertical level with lots of vines and trees to climb. Funky Monkey helps Chester in this level by jumping on enemies and retrieving the motorcycle from a branch that Chester can't reach.Stage 3: Gator Alley A very horizontal level taking place over water that is filled with enemies and areas where Chester will fall into the water. The Hip-O helps Chester by acting as a moving platform so he can cross some water. There is a lengthy boat section where Chester must avoid Mean Eugene's boat and some logs.Stage 4: Hidden CavesA cave stage filled with bats and boulder punching pigs. This level has many pitfalls that will cause the player to be looped back to the beginning of the stage. It also has a lengthy   mine cart sequence that, like the boat section in the previous level, involves dodging Mean Eugene. Stage 5: Bird HouseThe first seconds of this level take place on a jungle canopy but as soon as you can say "Dangerously Cheesy" Chester is launched onto the back of a large butterfly-like creature and the beginning of an incredibly long flying sequence begins. Mean Eugene attacks in a helicopter with rockets, but is finally defeated for good and Chester grabs the final part of his motorcycle.  [CR] Power-ups[CR]There are a number of items that can be grabbed that help Chester in his muffler-hunting quest.Cheetah Paw: This health restoring item resembles one of the cheeto paw snakes that were in production in the early nineties. This is surprisingly the only possible reference to cheetos in the game.Sunglasses: Although Chester is always wearing sunglasses, he can grab this additional pair to turn the screen monochrome and reveal hidden badges.Guitar: This guitar will make Chester invulnerable as he rocks out. The problem with this item is that it relinquishes control from the player as Chester stands in one spot and takes a few hops to the left and right. In one stage grabbing the guitar will cause Chester to jump off the platform he is on and get damaged by water. Sneakers: These give Chester the ability to dash by holding down a button. When dashing Chester can jump a considerable distance. Until the Chester gets these he can only walk at a pace that should make him ashamed to call himself a cheetah. Skateboards: The skateboard will bring Chester to the bonus stage. In the bonus stage Chester rides the motor powered skateboard to collect as many badges as possible. Paw Badges: The standard    collectible. Get one hundred and get an extra life. [CR]Manual   [CR] Don't walk, run! To buy some Cheetos brand corn snacks!     Chester Cheetah: Too Cool to Fool comes with a gem of a manual. Not only is it filled with      Engrish, but the writers have attempted to have every line rhyme. This leads to sentences  such as "Good gain by swipin' the motorcycle frame!" and "If you're hip and brave enough, check out these Hidden Caves and stuff."The manual also has a coupon for 50 cents off a bag of paw shaped Cheetos. The coupon expires 12/31/93.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Chester Cheetah: Wild Wild West is the second of two games for the Super Nintendo and Genesis based on the radical feline Cheetos mascot Chester Cheetah. Like the first, Too Cool to Fool, Wild Wild West is a side-scrolling platformer that pits Chester Cheetah against his old nemesis Mean Eugene the zookeeper as well as various other less-than-cool humans and animals. He can collect one-use items that will help him survive, and the player can determine which stage he visits next via a map of the USA.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Well, it finally happened. Chester Cheetah escaped captivity at the zoo and was cruising down the road on his awesome motorcycle following his map to Hip City. Suddenly, Mean Eugene stole his map, ripped it to pieces, and scattered them across the United States. He needs to recover all the pieces by travelling the breadth of the continent, avoiding Mean Eugene all the while. Because, after all...it's not easy being cheesy.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Chester on the way to 7-Eleven for some Cheetos[CR]The gameplay in Wild Wild Quest is fairly different than its prequel. The mechanics and sprites are completely redone and, in most cases, of much higher quality. For example, the artists went through the trouble to put shading on things.[CR]Now that he's out of the zoo Chester has decided to add a bit of pep to his walk and goes at about twice the speed that he did in Too Cool to Fool. Chester can also dash without the need for a power-up and perform super jumps. Chester is a fragile kitty though and will die after one hit if he isn't carrying a bag of Cheetos Brand Crunchy Cheese Flavored Snacks.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Levels are selected from a level select screen modeled on a US map. The player chooses a starting level and from there can choose from the level to the left or right of the level they just played.[CR]In each level Chester must find the map piece before the timer runs out. Once the map piece is found Chester has to find his way to the "GOAL" sign at the end of the level. Each level has a bizarre boss fight after the player reaches the goal.Euphreaka: Located in Northern California this beachy level is filled with palm trees, vultures and a very angry fat beach lady.Quakers-Field: This Californian town is filled with orchards, junked cars and buildings of questionable sturdiness.Omahog: A farm level based in Nebraska.Lostin: This town in Massachusetts is filled to the brim with water, pirates and ships.Numb: Chester makes his way up north to Alaska to slide around on the ice and enjoy the auroras.Wall Up: New Mexico's finest sombrero'd cacti watch as Chester runs through this desert.Little Shock: Chester must navigate his way through this power plant in the heart of Arkansas.Un-Clearwater: Will Florida's swamps thwart Chester's need for a map piece?Not-So-Great-Falls: Lots of hyphens don't keep this mountainous Montana level down.Rally: Once Chester gets all of the map pieces he makes his way to North Carolina to beat Mean Eugene in a NASCAR race. This is less of a level and more of a final boss stage.[CR]Collectibles[CR]It's almost like this game is an ad for Cheetos or something...Cheeto Paw: Levels are filled with Cheeto paws of all sizes. Although they are counted, they don't give you any extra lives, just lots of points.Bag of Cheetos: Unlike Too Cool to Fool, this game actually contains Cheetos. If Chester is carrying a bag of these he won't die when he gets hit by an enemy.Map Piece: One in each level, Chester needs this to finish a level.Friend Icon: There are several icons in each level representing one of Chester's animal friends. They give you points.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores 6,9,8,8 stating, "...Great animations, especially the guitar playing, along with a decent quest and a lot of different levels to keep the game rockin'. A definite winner".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Choplifter III for the SNES features entirely different levels from the Game Gear and GameBoy versions, and plays slightly different than other Choplifter games. While the controls and basic gameplay haven't changed significantly, and the main goal of each level is still rescuing a certain number of hostages, Choplifter III is faster and more action-oriented than earlier Choplifter games.[CR]Enemies appear in larger variety and numbers now. They reappear more often and some levels feature fights against large bosses. To compensate for this, there are more power-ups (such as missiles, bombs, invisibility, etc.) available, and it is possible to have the helicopter repaired at certain points in a level.</plot>

				<title_clean>Chrono Trigger</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Chrono Trigger is a traditional console role-playing game (RPG) released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on August 22, 1995 in North America and for the Super Famicom on March 11, 1995 in Japan. The game is well-known for its multiple endings, Active Time Battle system, and time-spanning storyline. Before its release, Chrono Trigger was a highly anticipated collaboration between Squaresoft and freelance members of Enix. The development team was comprised of the same minds behind the popular RPGs Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, earning them the moniker of "The Dream Team." The game has sold around 3.5 million copies worldwide across its various ports.[CR]At the time of its release, Chrono Trigger received great praise from critics and fans. Due to the game's multiple endings, story, music (by famed Final Fantasy composers Nobuo Uematsu and Yasunori Mitsuda), battle system, and detailed graphics, the game was so popular it sold two million copies within the first two months of release. Chrono Trigger has since been hailed as one of the greatest games of all time by various popular gaming websites and magazines (placing in the top 100 of IGN, GameSpot, and Famitsu's best games of all time features). Metacritic lists the Nintendo DS version of Chrono Trigger with a 92% or "universal acclaim."[CR]Development[CR]The development of Chrono Trigger was a collaboration between several influential figures in Japanese game development, including Hironobu Sakaguchi (creator of Squaresoft's Final Fantasy series), Yuji Horii (creator of Enix's Dragon Quest series), Nobuo Uematsu (composer of the Final Fantasy series), Yasunori Mitsuda (composer for Chrono Trigger), and Akira Toriyama (creator of the Dragon Ball series and longtime contributor to the Dragon Quest franchise).[CR]Chrono Trigger was produced by Kazuhiko Aoki and directed by Akihiko Matsui, Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita. Yuji Horii assisted Hironobu Sakaguchi in the supervision of the game. Yuji Horii, being a large fan of time travel, decided to center the game's plot around time travel. Masato Kato then edited and revised the storyline, and in the process created the idea of multiple endings. Yoshinori Kitase and Takashi Tokita also assisted in the writing of the script. Other designers working on the game include Tetsuya Takahashi, Yasuyuki Honne, Tetsuya Nomura, and Yusuke Naora.[CR]Hironobu Sakaguchi has talked about the development process of Chrono Trigger in a positive light. He cited humorous scenes in the game that he said would not be possible in a Final Fantasy game. He also referred to the development of Chrono Trigger as "playing in Toriyama's universe." Toriyama had a large influence on the game development. For example, when Squaresoft requested a playable animal character in the game, the team based Frog off of one of Toriyama's sketches.[CR]As the game was being developed certain elements were modified from their original designs and ultimately turned into well known parts of the story. When game testers complained about the difficulty and non-linearity of the game, the team added the End of Time so that players could get hints in relation to the next goal. Some of the novel features of the game also proved to be new challenges for the development team, which necessitated extra attention. Sakaguchi required the beta testers to play through the game twice, to confirm that the New Game Plus feature worked.[CR]The Famicom and Super Nintendo versions of Chrono Trigger both utilized 32 megabit cartridges that had RAM and battery backup for saving games. As the Japanese and North American versions of the game were developed on different schedules, they do contain some oddities. For example, the Japanese version contains art for the ending of the game and a running count of the amount of items in the player's inventory, and the North American version still contains an unused song for the unfinished Singing Mountain dungeon.Localization[CR]Ted Woolsey (an influential figure in translation) was asked to localize the game for North America in only thirty days. He didn't have a modern translation team, so to get the context of the game he had to memorize certain scenarios and read drafts of player's guides to get a feel for the game. Despite these facts, Ted Woolsey still said that this was one of his favorite games to translate.[CR]Localization for the North American market changed many things, mostly due to Nintendo of America's stricter standards at the time. References to breastfeeding, alcohol (changed to soda in the North American version), religion, and homosexuality (in the case of Flea, a character who looks physically like a woman but is in reality a man) were either simplified or removed from the game entirely. Localization also changed many of the main characters' names. There are a variety of possible reasons as to why this happened, perhaps because the Japanese names did not sound exotic enough. In the case of a few names, however, there was not enough space for the name to fit using English letters as opposed to Japanese characters.Connection to Secret of Mana[CR]According to Hiromichi Tanaka in 2011 and 2013, Chrono Trigger was originally planned to be what eventually became Secret of Mana, which itself was originally intended to be Final Fantasy IV and was produced by the team behind Final Fantasy III (Hiromichi Tanaka and Nasir Gebelli). In Tanaka's own words:[CR]After we finished FFIII, we started FFIV with the idea of a slightly more action-based, dynamic overworld rather than keep combat as a completely separate thing. But, at some point, it wound up not being IV anymore&#8230; Instead, it was eventually released as &#8220;Seiken Densetsu 2&#8243; (Secret of Mana), but during development it was actually referred to as &#8220;Chrono Trigger&#8221;. (laugh)[CR]At the time, just after FFIII, we were working with Mr. Toriyama on a game with a seamless, side-view system. A CD-ROM attachment for the Super Famicom was scheduled to be released, you see. So we had this enormous game planned out for the CD-ROM attachment, but ultimately we were never able to release it.[CR]So we had the Chrono Trigger project changed to a new game, and this other game we had been working on was condensed down into Seiken Densetsu 2. Because of this, Seiken 2 always felt like a sequel to FFIII to me.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Chrono Trigger takes influence from many elements of traditional Japanese RPG gameplay while abandoning others. For example, it borrows familiar concepts from earlier Final Fantasy games, such as menu and turn based combat, but largely eliminates the RPG staple of random enemy encounters, instead allowing players to view enemies in the field making it possible to avoid many conflicts all together.[CR]Another difference from previous RPGs is that actual battles do not occur on the overworld map. In Chrono Trigger battles occur in smaller exploration areas or dungeons where enemies are displayed in the environment. Aside from making encounters optional, having enemies onscreen also helps create a smoother battle transition since the characters will take battle formation in the onscreen environment instead of the game fading to a separate battle screen. The overworld serves to connect these areas with other places of interest such as town. Towns, as is usual in RPGs, contain areas where the party can rest or purchase items, weapons, and armor.[CR]Chrono Trigger was the first game to coin the term "New Game Plus," though the actual concept had appeared in other games dating back to the original Legend of Zelda. After completing the game, a player can create a New Game Plus allowing him or her to retain all equipment, levels, and Techs (this game's version of special abilities.) New Game Plus also allows the player to fight Lavos, the final boss of the game, much earlier in the storyline, which is how the game's multiple endings can be unlocked.[CR]The time travel aspect of Chrono Trigger transcends story purposes, affecting gameplay as well. Different periods of time become accessible during certain parts of the game. These eras can then be accessed through time portals or (later in the game) through a time traveling device that the party dubs "Epoch." Epoch can travel to any time period instantaneously, while the time portals can only lead the player to certain areas in a time period. Side-quests available in the past time periods of the game can influence events in future areas.Combat[CR]Chrono Trigger utilizes the Active Time Battle system, a battle system popularized by the Final Fantasy series. Each character has a bar which scrolls across based on the character's speed. Once the bar is filled, it is that character's turn.[CR]Unlike many Japanese role-playing games, there is no transition to a separate battle screen when the party encounters enemies. Instead, when a fight begins, a battle menu simply appears on the current area being traversed by the party (which can be moved between the top and the bottom of the screen). Enemies and characters aren't locked to a single grid either, as they move around the area fluidly. Depending on how the enemies and characters are placed on the field, some attacks have more effectiveness than others (for example, attacks that hit enemies grouped together).[CR]In combat, there are three options: Attack, Item, and Tech. Attacking has the character doling out a physical attack. Items are accesible through the second option, providing buffs and healing items. Techs are special abilities that each character can use, both magical and non-magical. Each character has a base magic ability, with abilities such as Water, Lightning, or Shadow (with the exception of Robo, who is a robot and Ayla, who was born before the creation of magic). In addition to individual (or Single) Techs, there are also Double and Triple Techs which involve two and three party members, respectively. Learning a Double or Triple Tech is dependent on which Single Techs the individuals involved have learned. The Double and Triple Techs cost each party member involved a corresponding amount of MP.Techs[CR]The element of the game which makes it stand out from other RPG's of the time is the tech system. The techs work like standard magic or skills in any other RPG, however Chrono Trigger puts its own spin on things. First off, as opposed to a Final Fantasy where there are dozens of magic options for each character, in Chrono Trigger each character has 10 individual techs which are usually unique to them and their element. These are just solo techs however, a huge element of the battles are the dual and triple techs.[CR]To unlock regular techs in the game each battle rewards the player with 3 basic things, money, experience, and tech points. Each character has their own standard of tech points that they need to reach to unlock the next solo tech. Learning dual and triple techs is done completely differently.[CR]Dual and triple techs are techs where you need either two or three party members turns to be ready. You go into the bottom of the tech menu for any of the characters and select the dual or triple tech. This is generally a strong move where each character performs a version of one of their own solo techs but they combine it with the other party members involved. These techs generally cost a lot of MP and have the added con of using multiple members turns at the same time for one attack.[CR]To unlock dual and triple techs you simply need to play 1 battle with the duo or trio in question after they have unlocked the single tech that they perform.[CR]When the player begins their journey the first thing they are prompted to do is choose between Active mode and Wait mode. Active mode is the traditional mode which is meant to make the player feel like they are in a rush during battles. During this mode every character has their own ATB bar while the enemies have their own invisible one. When the player is selecting whatever options they want the enemy can attack them at all times.[CR]In Wait mode the players characters can be attacked while they are waiting, however once they enter any combat menu the enemies actions freeze completely. This is an easier mode which gives the player some time to think about their actions.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Chrono Trigger takes place in the kingdom of Guardia throughout several different ages, primarily 1000 AD. The game opens with Crono, the game's protagnist, waking up on the day of the Millennial Fair. At the fair, Crono meets Marle, a mysterious and bubbly girl who ends up being teleported to the past after a mishap with a time machine. Crono decides to travel back in time as well and try to save her.[CR]Crono quickly finds that he has been teleported to the year 400 AD. This is an era in which the kingdom of Guardia is at perpetual war with the forces of an evil and powerful sorcerer named Magus.[CR]Upon visiting Guardia Castle, he finds Marle posing as this era's queen, Queen Leene. Unfortunately, their reunion is short-lived, as Marle vanishes suddenly after revealing her identity. On the way out of the castle, Crono finds Lucca, the time machine's inventor and a close friend of Crono, who has also traveled to 400 AD to see how she can help. Lucca tells Crono how Marle is actually the princess in 1000 AD, and that Queen Leene is her ancestor. When the castle guards found Marle, they stopped the search for Leene, essentially guaranteeing her death and ending her line.[CR]Crono and Lucca venture to a cathedral inhabited by monsters disguised as nuns. There, they meet Frog (who is actually Glenn, a knight who Magus turned into an amphibian), and manage to save the real queen as well as the chancellor. This fixes the timeline, and Crono and Lucca return home with Marle using a new device created by Lucca, the "gate key," which stabilizes temporal vortexes and allows the party to traverse time using pre-existing "gates."[CR]Back in 1000 AD, Crono decides to escort Marle back to the castle. There, Crono is put on trial for allegedly kidnapping the princess and attempting to usurp power from the throne. No matter what the player does at this point in the game, Crono is convicted and thrown into prison.[CR]The player can break out on their own or wait for the execution (in the latter case, Lucca saves Crono at the last moment). The duo battle their way out of the prison, meeting up with Marle, who decides to flee with them. The party finds a portal in Guardia Forest. Cornered, and despite Lucca's protests that they don't know where the gate leads, the group enters the portal.[CR]The party ends up in a post-apocalyptic wasteland in 2300 AD, and quickly discover an information center which gives them the location of another gate. The archive also has visual record of "AD 1999: The Day of Lavos." The video shows a gigantic monster emerging from the ground and destroying the world.[CR]The party decides to change the future by defeating Lavos in their own time.[CR]In another building, the group discovers a broken robot. Lucca decides to repair it, and Marle and Crono name him Robo. He repays the group by escorting them to the gate, located in "Proto Dome," and by helping the group fight off a group of defective robots bent on the destruction of humans.[CR]The gate in Proto Dome takes the party to a hub world known as the End of Time, occupied by Gaspar. Gaspar informs the group that all lost time travelers end up there. The party also meets Spekkio, Master of War, who teaches all the human characters magic.[CR]The party learns Magus tried to summon Lavos in 600 AD, but a legendary hero (supposedly Frog) stopped him. The legend says that he wielded a blade called the Masamune that they find broken. The only smith who could fix such a blade would be Melchior, an eccentric old man who lives outside a village of Mystics, the followers of Magus, in the year 1000 AD. After coming to him with the sword, he tells them that he needs a substance known as Dreamstone to repair it, and that such a rare stone only comes from millions of years in the past.[CR]The group travels to 65,000,000 BC, where they meet Ayla, a prehistoric human who saves the group from a group of hostile reptiles known as Reptites. Ayla agrees to give Crono a Dreamstone if he can beat her in a drinking contest. Crono wins the contest, and they all pass out. When they wake up, their gate key is gone, stolen by Ayla's jealous friend Kino. The party navigates through a jungle maze to get the key back, ultimately encountering (and chasing away) Azala, the ruler of the Reptites. During this encounter, the party learns about the advanced intelligence of the Reptites, compared to the still-primitive, barbaric human race.[CR]They travel back to 1000 AD, and visit Melchior, who willingly repairs the Masamune. Crono and company then go back to 600 AD to find Frog, who believes he is unworthy to wield the legendary blade. After some convincing, he agrees, even traveling to the End of Time to learn magic. The party enters Magus' lair, and encounter his three generals: Ozzie (the Trickster General), Flea (the transgendered magician), and Slash (the inhumanly quick swordsman extraordinaire), all of whom the party handily defeats.[CR]They then face off with Magus, who they believe is in the process of creating Lavos with a powerful spell. Magus recognizes Frog but shows no fear in the face of the Masamune. The party defeats the sorcerer, causing his spell to go awry--Magus then reveals that he was not creating Lavos but merely summoning it so that he could defeat it. The incident causes a massive time gate that sucks the party into 65,000,000 BC.[CR]Here, they meet up with Ayla again, and decide to help her destroy the Reptites, ending the war between them and the humans. After reaching the top of the fortress, it turns out Azala is waiting for an omen that will supposedly bring victory to the Reptite horde. The party is forced to battle Azala and her pet, a massive black tyrannosaurus rex. The group is victorious, and the omen turns out to be Lavos falling to the earth from space. Only Azala recognizes it for what it is: the end of the future.[CR]Crono and friends then travel to a huge kingdom of magic in 12,000 BC. The Kingdom of Zeal is a huge floating continent where humans practice magic, a long-lost technique by the time Frog's era comes around. The people of Zeal are getting all their power through the Mammon Machine, a machine that extracts Lavos' energy for their own good. While exploring Zeal, the party meets a mysterious prophet, who warns Queen Zeal about Crono's plans. A young boy also tells the party, "One among you will shortly perish."[CR]The queen exiles the party to the ground of the world, which is experiencing an Ice Age brought on by Lavos' crash-landing so many years ago. When the group finally gets back to the End of Time, the old man tells them of a machine called the Wings of Time. They journey back to 2300 AD and find the device, a large flying machine which they christen Epoch.[CR]The party travels back to Zeal intent on destroying the Mammon Machine in the Ocean Palace. They arrive too late, however, and Lavos then awakens. The prophet is revealed to be Magus, who attempts to destroy Lavos but is batted aside effortlessly. Lavos stuns everyone, but Crono pulls himself to his feet. He hurls himself at Lavos, but is instantly vaporized. The rest of the party wakes up in a hut on the ground of the world, which is where non-magic users have lived. During the confusion, an advisor to Queen Zeal named Dalton has stolen the Wings of Time (now the "Aero Dalton Imperial"), and has declared himself ruler of the world.[CR]When Frog wakes up, he goes outside and confronts Magus, who cursed him in the first place. Magus, for his part, is cocky, even insulting Crono and calling him weak for trying to stop Lavos. The player is given a choice: let Magus live or kill him and break the curse on Frog. If the player lets him live, he joins the party. The party goes to defeat Dalton, who imprisons them and requires a daring break-out, before being easily defeated. At the end of time, it is revealed that Magus was the mysterious prophet, and he only wanted to summon Lavos to kill it. It is revealed that the old man is a Guru named Gaspar. He informs the party of an egg called the Chrono Trigger, which they can use to resurrect Crono.[CR]At this point in the game, it is up to the player to save Crono or not. The main story is technically over aside from the final confrontation, a series of optional side quests open up, and resurrecting Crono is optional.[CR]If the player decides to revive Crono, Gaspar suggests that they visit Belthasar in 2300 AD. He knows the secret to bringing someone back from the dead. Belthasar tells them that Death Peak (also located in 2300 AD) is the key to reviving their downed comrade. However, there are two requirements: the need for Crono needs to be incredibly great and they will need an exact replica of him (which can be obtained from a magician in 1000 AD). After getting the replica, and visiting the top of Death Peak, Crono can be revived.[CR]Naturally, only one ending is considered canon. In this ending, the party reaches Lavos and manages to destroy its outer protective shell (either through fighting or crashing Epoch into it). Here, it is revealed that Lavos has been using the planet by harvesting DNA to control its evolution. It then proceeds to take on a final form, which is quickly destroyed by the team.[CR]The game then goes to a celebratory traditional ending at the end of the Millennial Fair. Crono and his friends all say goodbye and return to their respective eras via the time gates. If the player has Magus at this point, he leaves to search for his long-lost sister Schala. Depending on what the player did to penetrate Lavos' outer shell, Crono's mom either jumps into the time gate by accident (prompting the remaining party to go search for her) or Marle assists her father in hanging up Nadia's bell and accidentally getting carried away by some balloons (although she is saved by Crono).[CR][B]Endings:[/B][CR]There are a total of twelve endings in the original release of Chrono Trigger, with an extra variant for the last two endings, adding up to a technical total of fourteen. The PlayStation re-release added an extra two animated endings, bringing the total to sixteen. The DS re-release then added another extra ending, bringing the new total to seventeen endings.The Dream Team[CR]To receive this ending, which is most often regarded as most challenging, Lavos must be defeated when the party makes it to Lucca's teleportation panel. Here, the player meets many of the developers from the game). Additionally, when the credits roll a quote is briefly shown on screen, before the credits quickly scroll at an accelerated pace:[CR]"Congratulations on finishing the game! You're now a member of the Dream Team! And since you blew threw the game so fast, we've adjusted the credits to suit your style!"The Wedding[CR]To receive this ending, Lavos must be defeated after rescuing Marle from 600 A.D. The party ends up in the Millennial Fair. After wandering around for a while, the party notices that everyone is reacting strangely to Marle's clothing, saying things such as the fact that she is dressing "normally" again. After reaching the castle, it is revealed that Frog married Queen Leene in A.D. 600.Nu, Ribbit, and Kilwala[CR]To get this ending, Lavos must be defeated after the first trip to the End of Time, but before the fight on Zenan Bridge. The ending is a Nu, a Ribbit, and a Kilwala engaging in slapstick comedy.Tata the Hero[CR]To unlock this ending, Lavos must be defeated anytime after the battle at Zenan Bridge, but before getting the Hero Medal from Tata. The ending shows Tata walking into the chamber in which the party faces Magus for the first time, fires lighting all around him, only to realize that Magus has already been defeated by the party.Closing Scenes[CR]To get the fifth ending, Lavos must be defeated after repairing the Masamune, but before being stuck in 65,000,000 B.C. The ending shows various scenes from the game. Essentially, it is a movie featuring comedic clips from different places in the game.Still Scenes[CR]This ending is shown if Lavos is defeated after recovering the Gate Key, but before Frog joins the party permanently. The ending is similar to the "closing scenes" ending, except that it is a slideshow instead of clips. Many of the screenshots depict scenes that aren't actually from the game.Frog and Magus[CR]To get this ending, Lavos must be defeated after Frog joins the party permanently, but before Magus is defeated in his castle. Frog travels into Magus' Castle to unleash his revenge upon Magus. As Frog unsheathes his sword, the scene cuts to a cloaked figure. This figure could either be Frog or Magus, as they are the only two main characters in the game who wear cloaks.Reptites[CR]To unlock this ending, Lavos must be defeated after defeating Magus, but before defeating Azala in Tyran Castle. The ending starts off just as the game does, with a bell ringing and Crono's mom waking him up. The major difference, however, is the fact that all of the character sprites are Reptites. Since the party never defeated Azala from his reign of terror, the intelligent Reptite race gains dominance over humans.Magus' Revenge[CR]There are two possible ways to receive this ending. The first is to defeat Lavos after defeating Azala in Tyran Castle, but before watching Schala use her magic pendant to open the sealed door in Zeal Palace. The second way is to defeat Lavos after being thrown out of the Zeal Kingdom, but before making it through the Ocean Palace. The ending shows Magus walking alone in scenes that the party has been through in the game, on his own personal quest of revenge: defeat Lavos once and for all.Girl Chat[CR]To receive this ending, Lavos must be defeated after seeing Schala use her magic pendant to open the sealed door in Zeal, but before getting Marle's pendant charged. The ending features Marle and Lucca talking about all of the male characters in Chrono Trigger and rating them. This ending is notable for being the only time in the entire game where Crono speaks.Crono's Death[CR]There are two versions of this ending. In order to get this particular ending, the party cannot crash Epoch into Lavos. After Crono's death (and also Magus' death), everybody goes to their respective time period through the time gates. The remaining party members ends up at the Millennial Fair, with Frog being a human again. The remaining members set out to search for Crono. If Magus is still alive, then this ending is essentially the same, except Frog is still a frog.[CR]In another version of this ending, Lavos must be defeated after Crono's death, except the party must crash Epoch into Lavos. This ending is essentially the same as the other version of this ending except for the fact that all of the characters stay behind to go on a search through time for Crono. This ending is slightly different if the player has the Chrono Trigger and if the player saved Lara. If Magus is killed, Frog will still be a frog (unlike in the other version of this ending).Dream's Epilogue[CR]This ending was added in the DS version of Chrono Trigger. To get this ending, Lavos must be defeated after completing the Dimensional Vortex. Then, a new bucket will appear at the End of Time, called the Time's Eclipse. By going here, the party will meet Magus (regardless of whether he is in the party or not). He will offer to fight and flee, but will transform into the Dream's Devourer, who is controlling Schala.[CR]Upon defeating the Dream's Devourer, the party is blown away and Magus and Schala talk. Then, Magus is warped to a forest and apparently loses his memory. He leaves to try and regain it. This is when the PlayStation cut scene plays about the loss of the Masamune. By doing this ending, Crono also gets a new sword, the Dreamseeker, which has a 90% critical hit rate.Game Over[CR]Not technically a good ending to get, but in this ending, the only necessity is to be defeated by Lavos. This ending shows Lavos unleashing his power upon the world and destroying civilization.PlayStation Ending[CR]The extra PlayStation ending begins with the marriage of Crono and Marle. All of Guardia Kingdom's citizens are excited and cheering. The scene shifts to 65,000,000 B.C., where Ayla marries her friend, Kino, who is one of Marle's direct ancestors. The scene shifts again, this time to Guardia Castle, where Glenn (Frog's human form) is knighted. He walks through all of the other knights, although his face is never seen.[CR]The scene shifts back to Crono and Marle's wedding, and Melchior stumbles out of the crowd to congratulate them. They come out of the building to be greeted by a huge, cheering crowd. Marle throws her bouquet into the crowd, and the scene shifts again. Lucca is seen walking through a forest with a small green robot similar to Robo. She and the robot discover a baby lying on the ground next to a tree, wearing a strange necklace. She picks the baby up, smiles, and the scene fades to a "fin" screen.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]Throughout the events of Chrono Trigger, a variety of playable characters are introduced and made available to the player. In total, there are five playable characters, with one of the five being an optional character.Crono[CR]Crono is the main protagonist of the game. He lives with his mother in the town of Truce. After bumping into Marle at the Millennial Fair, he and his friends begin a quest to save the world (after witnessing the "Day of Lavos"). At one point in the game, Crono sacrifices himself in an attempt to destroy Lavos, but it fails and he dies in the process. It is optional, but he can be revived through use of the Chrono Trigger. In one ending cut scene in the PlayStation remake, Crono is seen marrying Marle. He also makes an appearance in the game Chrono Cross, as an apparition.[CR]Crono is a silent protagonist. Most of his emotions and actions are shown through gestures. Crono only speaks once in the entire game, in one of the game's multiple endings.[CR]Crono's attacks are all offensive based, with sparse healing (many of these are cooperative moves) moves as well. After meeting Spekkio, Crono gains the magical ability of lightning.Marle[CR]Marle, whose real name is Nadia, is the princess of Guardia, although she does not enjoy being a princess. Marle's weapon of choice is the crossbow. She is a very outgoing type and seems almost tomboyish. She is embarrassed by her ancestry, and at first did not tell Crono or Lucca that she is actually princess Nadia. Marle's element is Ice. Her Techs mainly consist of ice magic, healing magic, and party buffs such as Haste.[CR]Marle meets up with Crono at the fair. After getting Crono to give her a tour around the fair they meet up with Lucca. Marle's pendant causes problems with the teleportation panel, and sends her back in time to 600 AD. She gets mistaken for the missing Queen, her ancestor, and therefore ceases to exist, since the actual queen was never found. When the queen is returned, so is Marle, who decides to stay with Crono after she sees how much he risked just to save her.[CR] TechsTechMana CostAcquired atDescriptionAura110 TPRestores a small amount of HP to a single ally.Provoke150 TPCasts Confuse on a single enemy.Ice2Spekkio (End of Time)Attacks a single enemy with an ice elemental attackCure2150 TPRestores a medium amount of HP to a single ally.Haste6250 TPSpeeds up one allies ATB.Ice 28400 TPAttack all enemies with an ice elemental attack.Cure 25600 TPRestore a large amount of HP to a single ally.Life 215900 TPRevive a single ally with maximum HP.[CR] Lucca[CR]Lucca is Crono's best friend. She is extremely smart, lending to the fact that she spends most of her time building technological devices with her father. Lucca uses different types of projectile based attacks in battle. Lucca will also take out a hammer at times to hit nearby enemies. Lucca's elemental alignment is fire.[CR]After witnessing the Day of Lavos in 2300 AD, she decides to help alter the course of history. She immediately becomes good friends with Robo after repairing him.[CR]In Lucca's endgame sidequest she goes back in time to the moment where her mother Lara was crippled in an accident with one her father Taban's machines. A code must be entered into the machine to stop it from operating. The code turns out to be Lara's name, with the letters translated to the L-A-R-A buttons on a SNES controller. If this is done Lara will appear standing at the fair during the ending.[CR]Lucca appears in Chrono Cross as Dr. Lucca Ashtear. In the game, she has opened an orphanage.Frog[CR]Frog is a knight from 600 AD. He is the first ally the party meets who is not from their time. His real name is Glenn, but because of a curse cast upon him by Magus he has since taken the form of an anthropomorphic frog. Frog made a promise to himself that day to avenge his fallen comrade Cyrus.[CR]Frog is incredibly close to Queen Leene, vowing to protect her as opposed to the more traditional protection of the king. He is also the wielder of the legendary sword, Masamune. Frog has the special ability of water. Several of his Techs have reptilian references. For example, one Tech summons a large, multicolored frog to come and bounce on the enemies.[CR] TechsTech NameMana CostAcquired atDescriptionSlurp110 TPHeals a single ally for a small amount.Slurp Cut215 TPDashes to a single enemy with his tongue and slashes them.Water2Spekkio (End of Time)Attacks a single enemy with a water elemental attack.Heal210Restores a medium amount of HP to all allies.Leap Slash4250Jumps into the sky and dives down with his sword onto one enemy.Water 28400Attack all enemies with a water elemental attack.Cure 25600Restores a large amount of HP to a single ally.Frog Squash151,000A desperation attack. Attacks all enemies with a damage formula which gets higher with the more damage Frog has taken.[CR] Robo[CR]Robo is a robot from the future, whose real name is Prometheus, and whose serial number is R66-Y. Soon after being repaired by Lucca he decides to join the party and help destroy Lavos. He has a strong friendship with Lucca throughout the story. Robo uses his fists to attack the enemies. When Robo meets Spekkio he is told that robots cannot learn magic so he uses normal Techs throughout the game. Many of his Techs, however, can inflict the same status as shadow type magic.[CR]Being a robot, Robo can last for an incredibly long time. Due to this, one of his side quests is focused around restoring a long lost forest, by leaving Robo back in time for 400 years (although the party merely teleports to the present). During this time, he contemplates the existence of an "Entity" that is guiding the party's actions.Ayla[CR]Ayla is a cavewoman from 65,000,000 BC. She speaks in stereotypical caveman speech (leaving out words and referring to herself in third-person). Ayla was, according to Spekkio, born before the invention of magic, making her unable to learn any magic. As reconciliation for this disability, Ayla has incredibly strong physical attacks and Techs. Ayla uses only her body in battle, she uses no weapon despite her art showing her wielding a club.[CR]Ayla agrees to help Crono and his party after they defeat the Reptites, an evolved and intelligent dinosaur-like species that is intent on conquering the world. Lavos first lands in Ayla's time, and causes the complete annihilation of the Reptites, prompting Ayla to resign from her position of chief in her village.Magus[CR]Magus was originally a young boy known as Janus from 12,000 BC, but after an encounter with Lavos, he got sent forward in time to 600 BC, where he encountered Ozzie and founded the Mystics with his magical prowess. Magus then became obsessed with finding his sister Schala and killing Lavos.[CR]At one point in the game, the player has the option to either fight Magus, or have him join the party. Magus specializes in shadow magic, but also possesses several powerful Techs of other elemental alignments.[CR]Additional Characters[CR]Crono's Mom[CR]Crono's mom is a simple side character for most of the story. She is best known for her famous line to start the game, "Good Morning, Crono!" which was used in magazine ads for the DS remake of the game. The major interactions the player has with her are in the beginning where she sets the player up to name Lucca and the very end of the game where in one of the two best endings she accidentally runs into a closing teleporter in an attempt to catch Crono's runaway cat.[CR]Although the player only really has two interactions with Crono's mother which are at all relevant to the plot she does have some interesting comments on each of Crono's friends who go along with him on his journey. She can be visited at Crono's house any time during the game after the player can free roam.[CR] Chancellor[CR]The Chancellor is a major side character who appears in the Present and Middle Ages of Chrono Trigger. In both plotlines he is the right-hand man of the King of Guardia but he is known for some suspicious and borderline illegal behavior.[CR]As it turns out, in both time periods, the chancellor has been kidnapped by the monster Yakra and hidden in a treasure chest. So while he is a villain for the early portions of the game, it turns out that he is actually a good guy and on the Princess' side at all times.[CR] [CR] Spekkio[CR]Spekkio in all six of his forms.[CR]Spekkio is the character from the End of Time and probably the most important side character in the game besides Crono's mom. When the group first meets Spekkio in the end of time he will likely be in his second form, the Kilwala form. He will give each party member their respective elemental magic. As the player gets more party characters they should revisit Spekkio to gain the first level of elemental magic for each character.[CR]The characters elemental alignments are:[CR]Crono - Lightning[CR]Lucca - Fire[CR]Marle - Ice[CR]Frog - Water[CR]Robo - Non elemental but some Shadow related attacks[CR]Ayla - Non elemental, purely physical attacks.[CR]Magus - Shadow alignment, however holds the Fire 2, Ice 2, and Lightning 2 spells as well.[CR]Other Versions and Sequels[CR]Chrono Trigger, as the first game in the Chrono franchise, has had numerous ports. Chrono Trigger has been included on Final Fantasy Chronicles for the PlayStation, released as a standalone PlayStation remake, re-released on the Nintendo DS, on Virtual Console, and ported to both iOS and Android.[CR]At the time of its release, Chrono Trigger had three companion Satellaview games released: BS Chrono Trigger: Character Library, BS Chrono Trigger: Music Library, and BS Chrono Trigger: Jet Bike Special. The first two are just that; a character library and a music library. The third, however, is the jet bike racing minigame from the actual game, in which the player races against Johnny on a Mode 7 post-apocalyptic racetrack.[CR]Chrono Trigger on the PlayStation is not quite as rare as the Super Nintendo version. The PlayStation release was developed by TOSE Co. Ltd., and released on November 2, 1999 in Japan (as a standalone re-release) and on June 29, 2001 in North America as Final Fantasy Chronicles (the compilation merely contained an English version of the Japanese re-release). It added animated cutscenes, as well as an additional ending. The PlayStation version is also known for having longer load times and the ability to have more than the three files of the Super Nintendo version.[CR]The Chrono Trigger fan community has also developed several notable projects. Chrono Resurrection is an unreleased fan remake of several scenes from the game. Many high-profile game critics complimented the ambition of the project, and noted the professionalism of the project. However, Resurrection was halted when a cease and desist letter arrived from Square Enix, requesting that production be stopped.[CR]Another similar project that was halted in mid-development was more ambitious; it sought to remake the entire game. This project was known as Chrono Trigger Remake Project until it was shut down due to a cease and desist letter from Square Enix.[CR]Several other fan projects were shut down by Square Enix, many of which originated on Chrono fan-site Chrono Compendium. On May 8, 2009, Square Enix sent a cease and desist to the website for their Chrono Trigger: Crimson Echoes project, as well as requesting that the website remove information on other fan projects and ROM hacks: Chrono Trigger: Prophet's Guile, Chrono Trigger Retranslation, Chrono Trigger Re-amped, Chrono Trigger Rebirth, and Chrono Trigger Azala Style.[CR]Chrono Trigger has since had two sequels: Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Hoseki and Chrono Cross. Radical Dreamers was only released in Japan, but Chrono Cross was released worldwide for the PlayStation. Square Enix applied for the trademark Chrono Break in 2001, which has caused many fans to speculate about the possibility of the series continuing.Prerelease Versions[CR]There are two known prerelease versions (an alpha and a beta). The beta version has been leaked onto the internet and even translated into English. The alpha version was shown in preview videos and screenshots. Differences include an extra door in 600 AD Guardia Castle, paler guard sprites, no spikes in Crono's hair, five levels of elemental power (opposed to just one), large overworld differences, rough musical tracks, a slightly altered Epoch sprite, altered dialogue, changed door seal design, and a slightly different Arris Dome.[CR]The beta version, having been released onto the internet in ROM format, has much more information surrounding it. Known as the prerelease version (rather than beta), it is dated November 17, 1994, and was sent to reviewers and retailers to give a sample of what Chrono Trigger was before it was released. The prerelease is not a complete game. There are barriers blocking the way in Guardia Castle, Lab 32, and Magic Cave. By using location offsets, however, the player can access much more of the game. Location offsets are two digit hexadecimal codes that can be used with the code 7E0100XX (XX being the location offset). There are two other ways to access other areas in the game. The first is to use saved games in an emulator. The last way is to use the Epoch, which despite having a different sprite is completely functional in the prerelease. There are areas where the player can't access, but these are all places that aren't usually accessible via the Epoch. The Epoch sprite is likely one of the most different sprite in the prerelease (as other sprites have minor changes and palette swaps as opposed to large differences).The guard overworld sprite is located at the bottom; it is believed to have been a barrier.[CR]It has been long-rumored that Schala was a playable character in a prerelease version of Chrono Trigger. By examining the data in the ROM, it has been determined that this rumor is false. Not only are there no extra sprites for Schala (most importantly, no overworld sprites), there is not an eighth character slot and Schala's graphics are compressed (like all other non-playable characters, and unlike the decompressed graphics of the playable characters). If a playable character did have compressed graphics, it would give the game huge slowdown because the CPU would have to decompress the graphics during gameplay.[CR]Additionally, there is a guard overworld sprite in the overworld sprite data. At first, it was rumored to be an eighth character, but after analyzing non-playable character data, it has been found that the overworld sprite was likely a barrier to prevent the player from progressing, but was removed as the developers found a way to use the environment as a barrier instead. There are many other minor differences, mostly related to minor graphical, dialogue, and sound changes.DS Version[CR]The Nintendo DS version of Chrono Trigger was released on November 25, 2008 in North America, November 20, 2008 in Japan, and February 6, 2009 in Europe. This version adds many new features, but retains the gameplay and graphical style. The game features an all-new translation, the anime cut scenes of the PlayStation remake, and several new gameplay modes.[CR]The game can be played in either one of two modes: DS Mode and Classic Mode. DS Mode features touch-screen controls, while Classic Mode is the original game. New dungeons have been added as well, including Dimensional Vortex and Lost Sanctum. The Lost Sanctum is an area where the player can go for various side quests that can be done for items and money. These dungeons also contain new bosses, and in the case of Dimensional Vortex, a new final boss and a new ending. The graphics have been slightly altered, adding new sprites and animations in some cases.[CR]The Arena is a completely new mode in this version of the game. In this area, the player can raise creatures and align them to one of the four elemental types. Then, the player is granted with the choice of one of four "Smidges," each aligned with a corresponding element. Then, the player can send the creature into an area that has already been visited for training. Items for these creatures can be bought from a Nu merchant in the arena. Additionally, other non-playable characters' creatures can be fought using a trained Smidge.[CR]An Extras section has been added with various items, and a few hidden ones. This section is unlocked upon saving the game. There are two extra sections that can be unlocked as well, one being a Treasure Atlas and the other being the Endings, but both have certain requirements regarding position in the game.Theater - The theater has all of the cut scenes that the player has seen. Here, they can be viewed again.Art Gallery - The art gallery contains concept art for most of the characters from the game (as well as objects and creatures).Music Box - The music box is essentially the soundtrack for the game, containing all of the songs encountered in the game (and even the two unused tracks).Dojo - The dojo lists all of the attacks from the game (be it a single, double, or triple tech). The tech must be unlocked in the game for it to show up in the dojo.Bestiary - The bestiary lists all of the enemies encountered during the game. Information about each enemy can be viewed, from stats to techs.Item Encyclopedia - The item encyclopedia is almost exactly the same as the bestiary, except it lists all of the items that have been obtained rather than enemies seen.Other Media[CR]For several years, rumors circulated about the possibility of a Chrono Trigger anime. The rumors were partially true. An anime based on Chrono Trigger did exist, but it was a one episode special. The special was made in 1996 for a V-Jump convention. Titled Time and Space Adventures - Nuumamonjaa, the episode was sixteen minutes long. It followed a Nu and a Poyozo doll as they attempted to sell wares at a monster version of the Millennial Fair.[CR]A short manga was in the Japanese Chrono Trigger player's guide. Only ten pages long, it was a brief and comedic story following Crono. In the manga, he meets Marle and samples Lucca's teleportation device. The story ended quickly, although it was merely meant to be an introduction to the game. Another short manga was created that was essentially a manga version of the Chrono Trigger original animation video. It ran for several issues in the V-Jump magazine around and after Chrono Trigger's release. In addition, the magazine featured other specials relating to Chrono Trigger, most notably a large 3D model of Robo.[CR]Chrono Trigger, considering its popularity, had many guides released covering the game. Naturally, there was the Official Player's Guide from Nintendo Power (that was also used as a subscription bonus to Nintendo Power). Two other guides were published in Japan. Chrono Trigger: The Perfect is notable due to the fact that it contained much more information beyond that of a regular guide.[CR]This guide contained interviews from Yuji Horii and Hironobu Sakaguchi, two well-known developers who worked on the game. The second Japanese guide was Chrono Trigger Super Famicom Player's Guide, which contained the short manga based on Chrono Trigger (detailed above). Other than that, it was a traditional guide.[CR]Much more official merchandise was created for promotion of Chrono Trigger. Prior to the release of Chrono Trigger, many "prism cards" were released that showed scenes and characters from the game. These cards are especially notable for their depictions of scenes that differ from the actual game (showing insight on the game's development and prerelease versions).[CR]In addition, many of the cards had "mockups," which are scenes that the developers created for promotional purposes, and do not actually appear in the game. The cards were holographic, making them difficult to spread on the internet (as noted by Chrono Compendium, which has images of all of the cards). Other merchandise for Chrono Trigger includes bookmarks (released to promote the PlayStation rerelease) and keychains (also released of Chrono Cross, possibly sold at arcades prior to the games' releases).[CR]Fan Remakes, Rom Hacks, and Rereleases[CR]Chrono Trigger had two popular rereleases which each added their own content. The first of the two was on Playstation in 2001. The game was rereleased on a disc collection entitled Final Fantasy Chronicles which contained a rerelease of Chrono Trigger with an added animated ending and a series of animated cutscenes throughout the game, and a rerelease of Final Fantasy IV with 3D cutscenes.[CR]In 2009 Chrono Trigger was rereleased again on the Nintendo DS. This version included the anime cutscenes added in the 2001 rerelease as well as having a whole new battle mode and introducing a new extra dungeon. In addition to this, the game also changed its visual format to use the most potential of the Nintendo DS' dual screens. In battle the menu options are on the bottom screen while the top screen shows the entirety of the battlefield along with the characters involved in the battle.[CR]The Playstation rerelease version has become the defacto version in any new rereleases of the game.[CR]The fanbase of Chrono Trigger also spawned multiple ROM hacks in an attempt to followup the story. The two most popular of which are Crimson Echoes and Flames of Eternity.[CR]Crimson Echoes acts as its own standalone plot, with a story mode that can take almost as long as the original game to complete. The game features all of the same characters returning together again to defeat a whole new evil with time travel. One of the additional positives about this game is that it takes you to times that are different than the time periods you visit in the original game.[CR]Since the games official release in 2009 there has been a large market online of people writing the ROM to blank carts, putting labels on them and selling them as individual SNES cartridges.[CR]SoundtrackYasunori Mitsuda [CR]Chrono Trigger's music was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda and Nobuo Uematsu. Chrono Trigger was the first game that Yasunori Mitsuda composed for (later becoming well-known for his work not only in Chrono Trigger, but other popular role playing games such as Xenogears and Chrono Cross), but by then Nobuo Uematsu was a longtime Final Fantasy composer. One track in Chrono Trigger was also composed by Noriko Matsueda.[CR]Mitsuda was asked to work on Chrono Trigger when he became unhappy with the pay of being a sound programmer. Mitsuda took the job and set out on a goal to create music unlike any before. Many of his tracks were inspired by dreams, such as To Far Away Times. Later, Mitsuda had to leave development because of a hard drive crash (losing several in-progress songs) and stomach ulcers. At that time, Nobuo Uematsu came in to compose the remaining tracks.[CR]Chrono Trigger's music has been released in many soundtracks. The Original Sound Version was released in North America on January 21, 1995. The Original Sound Version contained three discs of 64 different songs, totaling at two hours, thirty-nine minutes, and fifty-two seconds. An arranged version of the soundtrack called Chrono Trigger Arranged Version: The Brink of Time was released on June 25, 1995. Unlike the Original Sound Version, it only contained one disc of ten songs totaling at fifty-two minutes and fourty-seven seconds.[CR]Two other soundtracks (Chrono Trigger Orchestra Extra Soundtrack, and orchestral arrangement soundtrack, and Chrono Trigger Original Soundtrack, a compilation of the "greatest hits" from the game) were also released. In addition, fans from OverClocked Remix, a site well-known for their work on Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix, released an album known as Chrono SymphonicOriginal Sound Version[CR]The Original Sound Version release of the Chrono Trigger soundtrack was released on March 25, 1995.

				<title_clean>Chuck Rock</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Chuck Rock is a prehistoric-themed platformer starring the eponymous caveman Chuck on a quest to rescue his wife from a jealous rival. Chuck's main form of attack is a stomach bump with a limited range, but he is also able to take advantage of rocks littering the stages to attack enemies from afar. He can also use these rocks to create platforms to higher areas he cannot reach by jumping normally. While most dinosaurs are hostile some, like the wading brachiosaurs and certain pteranodons, will assist Chuck by taking him to new areas of the stage.[CR]UK developers Core Design originally created Chuck Rock for the Atari ST and Amiga computer platforms, and it was subsequently published on many home consoles of the era by Sony Imagesoft and Virgin Interactive in Europe and the US. It is perhaps best remembered for its rock n' roll theme tune. It was followed up with a direct sequel starring Chuck's son Chuck Jr., called Chuck Rock II: Son of Chuck, and BC Racers, a spin-off cart racer game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level skip[CR]Enter the code at the title screen.

He estimated the world would be flat within just a few days, unfortunately so would most of the population.Bad Mr. FrostyAs grand master of Mudville, Bad Mr. Frosty became head gift wrapper for the firm of S. Clause and Co. Mudville division. Unfortunately his gifts usually required a minimum of fifteen days to thaw out.TinyAfter becoming Mudville grand champion Tiny retired from the fighting world to pursue a career in the exciting world of fast food.

As part of the package, he provides all guests with free dancing lessons and complementary designer hats from his new line of refrigeratable fashions.OctoheadWhen Octohead became grand champion of Mudville he turned the land into the beach party capitol of the world. Of course, he first had to build a beach. To kick things off he invited 24 locals to a private bash aboard his surf board.GoogooAs the new grand master of Mudville, Googoo provided public nap centers for all Mudvillians. The now well rested public were much friendlier. Mudville quickly became a much happier place, but it also quickly became a noisier place due to the sharp rise is public snoring.HoppyAfter Hoppy became the grand master of Mudville, he immediately declared motorcycles the official vehicle of the land. This meant that anybody could tear up the road aboard a thundering chopper, even children, as long as they used training wheels.KangooAfter becoming grand master of Mudville, Kangoo donated her championship belt to the local museum. She also donated her opponent, who probably wouldn't be waking up for a while.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]Enter these on the title screen:</plot>

				<plot>Standard side-scrolling fighter based off of the Stallone film of the same name. Sly must fight thugs and the elements as he tracks down suitcases of stolen cash dropped around the peaks of the Rockies. Combat follows the Final Fight standard, broken up by some mountain climbing and running (or 3-D snowboarding on the Sega CD) from avalanches. [CR]Enemies are the standard brawler crooks, occasionally carrying guns and knives the player can pick up. The game tends to follow a pattern of having you deal with a natural hazard (scaling a cliff, leaping over gaps), then locking the screen down for a fighting segment, nature again, fighting again, etc. The available fighting moves is limited, compared to other games of this type, and the ability to hit an enemy character is noticeably less accurate.[CR]The plot is identical to the film, with levels based off of, or inspired by, scenes in the movie. Animated cutscenes move the story along on the cartridge systems, while brief clips from the film play between levels on the Sega CD.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 2 Player Beat em up Mode[CR]In game menu press the following keys 5 times with control pad 2:[CR]B, Up, Down, Up, Down, Left, Right, A[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 2 Player Beat em up Mode[CR]A sound will confirm the code. After that press Start on "Start Game". Now you are able to fight against player 2("Walker"). To exit the mode press Start + Select on any controller.</plot>

				<title_clean>Combatribes, The</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Combatribes is a brawler game developed by Technos Japan, the creators of Renegade and Double Dragon. It was originally released for the Arcades in 1990 and was later ported to the Super Nintendo in both Japan and the US in late 1992/early 1993. The SNES version features a few changes from the Arcade original, including censoring a lot of the violence (especially in the US version) and removing the ability to pick up weapons and downed enemies. The SNES version does add additional story elements, however.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The Combatribes are a group of cyborg vigilantes who protect the citizens of New York City from various gangs. The group consists of leader Berserker, who wears blue and has average speed and strength; Bullova, who wears yellow and is strong but slow; and Blitz, who wears red and is fast but weak. The fourth member of their group, Martha Splatterhead, is captured and turned evil by gang leader M. Blaster.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Combatribes is similar to other games in the genre like Double Dragon or Final Fight. The player's chosen character works his way from left to right, beating up lesser henchmen until they eventually face a boss. However, unlike similar games, Combatribes doesn't feature life bars for the villains and there are no weapons to pick up. The stages are also smaller than typical beat'em up stages. The characters have a relatively small move set consisting of a punch, kick and jump. There is a wide range of moves the player character can do to downed opponents however, including flying elbows, drop kicks, etc. depending on where they're positioned.[CR]In addition to the story mode there is a one-on-one fighting mode that features all the characters encountered in the game, however the player must enter codes received at the end of levels to unlock any characters other than the three main Combatribes.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The Combatribes work their way through five gangs to get information about where Martha is being held.The Motorcycle Nuclear Warheads - A gang of motorcycle riding punks led by an obese man with a board named Fats.The Demon Clowns - At an abandoned amusement park, the Combatribes must face a gang of clowns before fighting their boss Salamander, a fire breather.The Slash Skate Screamers - A group of roller-skating hockey players have taken over a skating rink. They're led by Thrash, a mohawked punk with a chainsaw.The Stadium Barbarians - A gang of baseball players control a baseball stadium led by Tomahawk, a Native American.The Slaughter Troops - The Combatribes arrive at M. Blaster's headquarters and make their way through his elite troops to fight the man himself, whose body is mostly robotic.The Final Battle - After a boss rush of all the previous bosses, the Combatribes fight against Martha Splatterhead. After defeating her, she briefly returns to her old self and thanks the team for stopping her before dying. The Combatribes take her body and then leave the city, never to return.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]These are some codes to unlock all of the available groups of fighters in the VS. mode.

				<plot>Congo and Congette were a pair of monkeys happily living in the jungle. One day a magic ruby fell out of the sky and turned both Congo and Congette into half-humans. The ruby also brought forth a demon-kid who prompty kidnaps Congette. It will be up to the newly evolved Congo to travel across the jungles and rescue her.[CR]Congo's Caper is a side-scrolling platform action game. Being the second Tatakae Genshijin game, it is the sequel to Joe &amp; Mac and controls very similar to that game. Players move Congo to different locations on a map, each representing one level. Controlling Congo, the player can move left, right, jump, duck, swim, climb ladders, roll down hills and swing his club to attack enemies. If Congo is damaged or hit by enemies, he reverts to a monkey form. Another hit as a monkey will kill him and use up one of his lives. To return to human form, Congo can collect a ruby or if he collects rubies while already human he can turn into an invincible Super Congo for a short while. Collecting 100 diamonds or 1 big diamond will give Congo and extra life while collecting sapphires will spin the slot machine (and possibilities of bonuses).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Unlimited Lives[CR]In the Haunted Stages, find Joe's statue and repeatadily hit it with your club to get extra lives. Repeat until you are satisfied.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Contra III: The Alien Wars (Contra Spirits in Japan and Super Probotector: Alien Rebels in Europe) is a 1992 Super Nintendo Entertainment System game developed and published by Konami. It is the third console iteration of Contra, hence the title "Contra III". Originally, Contra Force was planned to be released first, but it ended up being released afterward.Jimbo? No way man, it's Bill effin' Rizer.[CR]In 1994, the game was ported to the Game Boy by Factor 5. It featured numerous differences, such as the removal of the ability to hold two weapons simultaneously. In 2002, the game was ported to the Game Boy Advance as Contra Advance: The Alien Wars EX. The two top-down levels were cut out and replaced with stages from Contra: Hard Corps. The game was also ported to the Wii Virtual Console in 2007. Contra III: The Alien Wars is also one of the few games to be on the Nintendo Super System, an arcade system used to preview upcoming Super Nintendo games.[CR]In the game's story, the year is 2636. Aliens are once again invading, so it's up to Bill Rizer and Lance Bean to beat sweet justice into the aliens. In the American version of the game, Bill and Lance are named Jimbo and Sully. Since the original NES Contra games take place in modern times, Jimbo and Sully are explained to be Bill and Lance's descendants. In the European version of the game, they were considered cyborgs named RD008 and RC011.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A mutated turtle creature, and the first boss[CR]Contra III: The Alien Wars is a traditional Contra title. It has fast-paced, gritty, old-school action. Contra III is the first game in the Contra series to allow the player to hold two weapons, making it a landmark title in the franchise. In addition to that change, the power of the Super Nintendo allowed for larger, more detailed sprites and much more complex level design. Players can now jump on bars and climb on them monkey-bar style, climb walls and ladders, destroy various objects (such as the car right in front of the player in the very first level), and vehicles (such as a tank in the first level). New levels include one in which the player must jump between missiles while destroying an enemy ship, riding on a motorcycle while speeding down a road, riding on a jet ski, and two Mode 7 top-down levels.[CR]In the Mode 7 levels, the player controls the view using the two shoulder buttons (R and L). By pressing these buttons, the camera rotates around. At the start of the stage, the player gets to choose where to be dropped in. Navigating around the area and destroying various targets eventually leads the player to a boss, which must be disposed of in a fashion similar to the 2D side-scrolling bosses.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]If the Contra series has been known for anything, it's the wide variety of weapon power-ups available to the player. The letter next to each weapon in parenthesis detonates which lettered power-up awards the weapon to the player. By tapping the X button (standard controls), the player can swap between two weapon slots. If killed, only the weapon in the current slot will be taken away from the player as a penalty. Note that tapping X while shooting will rapidly switch weapons, allowing the player to fire anything twice as fast (within the physical limits of the player in question). Also, holding both shoulder buttons and pressing fire will result in a spinning attack with both equipped weapons being fired 360 degrees.Machine Gun (N/A) - The starting weapon of Contra III. Has a high rate of fire, but only shoots in one direction and has very low damage.Spread Shot (S) - Essentially the shotgun of the game. Fires out five weak shots that shoot out in five directions in front of the shooter. Excellent for clearing out crowds of foes and does good damage to bosses at close range. Not nearly as overpowered as in previous games in the series.Homing Missiles (H) - Weak missiles that seek out enemy targets.Laser (L) - A powerful gun that fires out one shot in side-scrolling levels, but turns into a continuous beam when in a top-down level. Takes down bosses with great speed.Shield (B) - Gives the player temporary invincibility to everything except for falling off the screen.Bomb (has the appearance of a bomb) - Sends out a circular wave of destruction that slowly spreads over the entire screen. Damages bosses and will instantly destroy most normal enemies. After each death, players will respawn with one bomb, and more can be obtained as weapon pickups.Crush Missile (C) - With the exception of the bomb, the strongest weapon in the game. It has short range, but incredible splash damage to compensate. When paired with another Crush Missile, it can take down bosses faster than any other weapon.Flame (F) - A flamethrower. Short range but can pass through barriers, making it ideal for certain situations. Also, when holding the fire button and switching the direction of fire, the flame will move in a waving pattern instead of snapping to the new direction like other weapons, providing a wider range of fire.[CR]Mode 7[CR]Contra III: The Alien Wars made use of the Mode 7 graphics mode of the Super Nintendo throughout the game. An example of its use within the game is within the first stage as the low-flying plane which appears mid-stage forms part of the background layer and is animated using Mode 7 (as it comes towards the player its size increases while its wings bank slightly). The bombs which it drops however are sprites.[CR]A second example would be the turtle boss at the end of the first stage which also sits in the background but its moving legs and the bullets that it fires are sprites. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 30 Lives (Japanese Version)[CR]This is for the japanese version only. At the title screen do a hadoken style motion that is Down, Down+Right, Right and press start. You should hear the player dieing sound effect if done correctly. You should position your cursor before entering it or you will start a 2 player game. You can position it above options and when you enter the options menu it will say Player Lives 30. The code remains enabled unless you change how many lives you start with in the options. If you do you must reenter the code. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 30 Lives (Japanese Version)[CR]At the title screen, quickly press: Right, Right-Down, Right and X. If done correctly you'll access the sound test.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 30 Lives (Japanese Version)[CR]At the title screen, quickly press: Down, Down-Left, Left, Up-Left, Up and Start for a 1-players stage select. Down, Down-Left, Left and Start for a 2-players stage select. If done correctly you should see the stage select screen.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Infinite lives[CR]Note: It will speed up the process if you use a turbo controller.[CR]When you get to level 3, fight your way through the stage until you get to the mini boss "The Flying Squito Nest" (the mini boss after you climb the building). Make sure you have the machine gun as your weapon or this won't work. Position your character as far to the left of the screen as you can and have him facing the right. Tape down the Y button and turn on your turbo mode. Set your controller down and come back in a few minutes to get a lot of lives (your lives max out when they get to 29).</plot>

				<title_clean>Cool Spot</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]It's Spot![CR]Cool Spot is a 2D side-scrolling platformer developed and published by Virgin for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis in 1993. It is the second game to star Spot, the tiny anthropomorphic red dot and then-mascot of the 7 Up brand of soft drinks. As one of the many Spots, players must guide it around the world, rescuing other Spots from their unexplained imprisonment in cages.[CR]The game was later released in 1995 for the Sega Game Gear, Game Boy, Sega Master System (Europe only), Amiga (Europe only), and PC (Europe only). It later received a sequel, titled Spot Goes To Hollywood, for Genesis, Saturn, and PlayStation.[CR]While the game was a licensed promotion with the soft drink, European versions removed the branding (since the European version of 7 Up did not have Spot as its mascot).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Spot can jump and attack by firing soda bubbles which can be shot in all directions and while jumping. Cool Spot can also cling to and climb on various things.[CR]In each level, the player must rescue other cool spots, who look exactly alike, from cages at the end of that level. The end of the level is not necessarily the point at the far right of the level map. In order to do so, the player is required to collect a certain number of "spots" that change (usually increase) as the game progresses. "Spots" are placed across the level in large quantities, and are the game's substitute for items such as Sonic the Hedgehog's gold rings (these were often used in this style of game, mostly for points). A player's health is monitored by a humorous Cool Spot face that gradually bends forward and will eventually fall from its position as damage occurs. Damage is taken by touching enemies, their projectiles, or certain level obstacles. Each level is played with a time limit. If the clock hits zero, a life is lost regardless of the player's health.[CR]The game has no save feature but does use checkpoints in the form of flagpoles. Once passed, the flag raises and a trumpet sounds. If a player loses a life after reaching a checkpoint, the player can restart further in the game.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cool World is a platformer/adventure game based on the movie of the same name. The player must navigate Cool World as either cop Frank Harris or cartoonist Jack Deebs (played by Brad Pitt and Gabriel Byrne respectively in the movie), depending on the version, and prevent Holli Would from passing over to the real world.[CR]The game was released on many platforms between 1992-93, around the time the movie was released. Like most licensed movie tie-in games of the era, it was not well received critically.Super Nintendo Version[CR]In the Super Nintendo version the player assumes the role of Jack Deebs and is trying to find a way to escape Cool World and return to the real world. A large part of the gameplay involves solving adventure game puzzles and avoiding the "Popper Police" for as long as possible. If the player collects enough coins, they can pay the fine and keep playing.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cyber Spin is a sci-fi racing game known in Japan as Shinseiki ("New Century") GPX: Cyber Formula, based on the anime Future GPX Cyber Formula. While the Japanese version retains the characters and world of the anime, including cutscenes, the US version mostly excludes them to focus on the racing.[CR]The game is shown from a top-down perspective, with icons to inform the player when a turn is approaching. The player must qualify for each race with a time trial before taking part in the race proper. Due to the futuristic nature of the game (it's set in 2015), the player has access to speed boosts which greatly increases their speed for short bursts, but employing this boost uses up some of the player's finite energy bar.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Passwords[CR]GPX Mode[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Passwords[CR]Scenario Mode and Free Mode.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cybernator (Assault Suits Valken in Japan) is a side scrolling mech combat game from NCS, which was published in Japan by Masaya, by Konami in the US and by Palcom in Europe. It is the second game in the Assault Suits series and follows Assault Suit Leynos, best known in the West as the Sega Genesis game Target Earth.[CR]The player plays as Jake Brain, a soldier in the Pacific States Marine Corps and pilot of a hulking assault suit, on a mission to destroy the Axis.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game has a number of features that characterize it and separate it from other side scrolling platformers of the day. There is a detailed aiming system, with multiple degrees possible, more than the standard up/down/diagonals in most shooters. The suit also has a limited jump/flight capacity, giving a sense of weight to the player's movements and making it important to consider the environment. There are also special stages, where the player is tasked to fly at speed through asteroids, or maneuver through the Earth's atmosphere on re-entry.[CR]The game has two endings, good and bad, achieved through completing or failing a majority of the side missions in the game respectively.[CR]Release Differences[CR]The game was edited for its US localization, a notable scene where the leader of the enemy forces commits suicide being censored, and other details like character portraits being removed from in game conversations.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When released, the SNES version was given the scores of 8,8,8,8 and an Editor's Choice Gold Award from Electronic Gaming Monthly. They added, "...the soundtrack is really kickin', and it's easy to get lost in the beat. Graphically it uses astounding detail and colors. The Mode 7explosions need work however, and the control is a little choppy at first".[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] The Napalm Gun + Unlock its upgrade ability[CR]To get the Napalm Gun, all you have to do is complete the first level WITHOUT SHOOTING ANYTHING EXECPT THE BOSS OF THE LEVEL. However, you DO have to complete one more task before it stays with you for the whole game: you MUST complete level 2 WITHOUT DYING. If you can complete level 2 without dying, the congratulate yourself on a job well done; you now have the most powerful weapon in the game. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] The Napalm Gun + Unlock its upgrade ability[CR]I have recently learned that you can also unlock the ability to upgrade the Napalm Gun. Clear the second level WITHOT HITTING or SHOOTING ANYHTING execpt the boss. If you can accomplish this difficult task, you can now upgrade the Napalm Gun. At Level 3 the fireballs bounce off walls.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]D-Force, or Dimension Force, is a Super Nintendo vertical shoot 'em up in which the player controls a blue and red Apache helicopter. Each stage alternates between "Shooting Mode", which plays like a traditional shoot 'em up with realistic enemies and "Exploration Mode", which allows the player to change their altitude and fight unusual enemies like dinosaurs.[CR]Like the later Axelay, D-Force takes full advantage of the Super Nintendo's Mode 7 by emphasizing its sprite scaling technology. Before starting each stage, the player takes off from a zoomed-in version of the background (similar to Pilotwings) and, upon losing all their lives, spirals towards the incoming ground in the same effect. The Exploration Mode stages allows the player to drop their height, which also zooms in on the background.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Darius Twin</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Darius Twin is the first Super Nintendo entry in Taito's Darius series of shoot 'em up. It is the third game in the series chronologically. Like the rest of the series, the game has multiple branching paths and aquatic-themed bosses, often resembling sea creatures like angler fish and hermit crabs.[CR]Darius Twin was followed by another Super Famicom/SNES exclusive game in the Darius series, 1993's Darius Force. Darius Force is known as Super Nova in the US. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Darius Twin takes place sometime after the events of  Darius II (known as Sagaia outside of Japan). Darius, the home planet of the Darius series, has been taken over by an alien race, the Belser and their alliance, who have ruthlessly conquered parts of the galaxy in aquatic-themed spaceships. The player's job is to pilot a 'silver hawk' fighter craft, making their way back to Darius, and free it from the Belser. Depending on the path taken, and whether or not the player is successful at the task, there are five different endings that can be attained. While they differ in how thoroughly the player has managed in driving off the Belser, in all of them it's apparent that the player will be called back into action against some foe sooner rather than later.[CR]This game does not depend much on the storyline. The only reference to the story seen is in the intro before the title screen and in the outro screens at the various endings.[CR]Planets[CR]Planet select screen.[CR]In Darius Twin each game level (called "rounds" in-game) represents a planet that is being cleared of the Belser forces on the way to liberating the home planet of Darius. Every time a round is cleared, a screen displaying 12 planets arranged broadly in the shape of a fish is shown. The player has the option of 12 different paths through these, meaning that one playthrough requires only seven rounds.[CR]The choice of path can affect what enemies will be faced, what upgrades will be received, and also which ending will be seen. The following table gives an overview of what upgrades are to be found on which levels, and where mini-boss fights are faced.PlanetA: OrcaWeaponShieldMini-BossBombShieldWeaponBombBomb    B: DantoWeaponBombMini-BossScreen Kill        C: KolodaShieldBombMini-Boss         D: LankusBombShieldWeapon SwitchBombBombBombShieldShield    E: PadiShieldExtra LifeShieldBombMini-Boss*Screen Kill*WeaponShieldWeaponBombBombShieldF: RearWeaponMini-BossWeapon*ShieldShieldBombExtra LifeBombShield   G: NarakiniWeaponMini-BossBombShieldShieldShield      H: SabiaBombShieldShieldBombShieldMini-BossShieldShieldWeaponWeapon  I: KarudoShieldShieldScreen KillWeaponWeaponMini-Boss      J: NoemuWeapon*ShieldWeapon SwitchExtra LifeShieldScreen KillShield     K: HorolainWeapon SwitchShieldShieldScreen Kill*ShieldExtra LifeBomb     L: Darius            [CR]* Denotes a random encounter[CR]Weapon upgrades are red, bombs green, shields blue, extra lives are orange, screen kill yellow, and finally, weapon switches are red octagons (as opposed to cubes).[CR]"Weapon Switch" upgrades is where the type of weapon the ship has is changed. Getting two of these would revert the ship's weapons back to the original type, and is not recommended. "Screen Kill" is an upgrade that. When activated, it destroys all the regular enemies on screen and deals a large amount of damage to mini-bosses.[CR]The final level, Darius, has no upgrades, only a series of repeated encounters with the mini-bosses from the other levels.[CR][B]Upgrades:[/B][CR]A blue (shield) and yellow (screen kill) upgrade among some enemies.[CR]Multiple upgrades are available in all planets/levels. To upgrade, the player must break a special cube container, which appears in packs of six. The sixth container will reveal a crystal that will yield an upgrade. The color and shape of the crystal will determine the kind of upgrade will be received. In typical arcade-game style, the upgrades appear mixed into the action, and it is entirely possible to miss them while fighting off the waves of enemies that appear along with them. This is an integral part of the gameplay of Darius Twin, with a lot of the challenge consisting in making use of the upgrades when available and, in co-operative mode, distributing them in the best way between the two ships.Weapons[CR]The red upgrades that are collected change the weapons available to the player. When the game begins, the player has small orange lasers and, depending on what upgrades are chosen, the player may end up with the big white fireballs or the more powerful wave weapon that also cuts through all enemies and obstacles. Each new upgrade increases the damage dealt and changes the look of the weapon's shots.[CR]The red octagon switches weapon type. Picking up the red octagon twice in a game will just switch back to the original weapon.Starting weapon progressionUpgrading the starting weapon type.Small orange laser.Larger orange laser.Dual orange lasers, larger than before.Small orange energy ball.Dual orange energy balls.Triple orange energy ballsLarge white energy ballLarger white energy ballLargest white energy ballAlternate weapon progressionUpgrading the second weapon type.Small orange laser.Longer blue laser.Thicker, brighter blue laser.Longer red laser.Brighter red laser that cuts through enemies.Narrow white wave that cuts through enemies.Broad white wave that cuts through enemies.Broader white wave that cuts through enemies.Broadest white wave that cuts through enemies.Bombs[CR]The green upgrades signify new types of bombs that are added to the arsenal and serve as a secondary weapon. The player starts with a single bomb that drops down in front of the ship. When they are at the maximum level, it finishes with four red fireballs shooting out diagonally that can hit multiple enemies.Secondary weapon progression:Upgrading the secondary weapon, the bombs.One small bomb that drops in front.Two small bombs that curve out (upwards and downwards) in front.Two additional bombs curving out of the back.Diagonal blue lasers shooting out in front, two ballistic bombs from the back.Four blue lasers shooting diagonally out from the ship.Four thicker, brighter blue lasers shooting out diagonally that cut through enemies.Four dual bright blue lasers shooting out diagonally and cutting through enemies.Four violet fireballs shooting out diagonally and cutting through enemies.Four larger violet fireballs shooting out diagonally and cutting through enemies.ShieldsUpgrading the shield.[CR]The shield upgrades are found in blue cubes, and add together to move the ship into one of three tiers of shielding. Before any shield upgrades are picked up, the ship has no defenses and will die in one hit. The shield allows multiple hits but it will get thinner and thinner as the ship gets struck, until finally it fails.One blue upgrade - Green shield.Four blue upgrades - Stronger silver shield.Nine blue upgrades - Strongest gold shield.Other upgrades[CR]Orange cubes contain extra lives - there are only two of these in the entire game. Yellow cubes are like bombs which kill every enemy on the screen, except for mini-bosses, who are damaged badly by them.[CR]Cooperative Multiplayer[CR]Two-player cooperative play.[CR]As the name implies, this game allows two-player simultaneous mode. Player 1 will get the red silver hawk and player 2 will get the blue one. There are no differences in upgrades, enemies or difficulties between one and two-player mode. Maxing out the primary weapons or the bombs of both ships will not be possible before reaching the last boss. The shields on the other hand can reach their highest levels for both ships if the correct order is chosen, and if no upgrades are missed.[CR][B]Endings:[/B][CR]There are five different endings. Which ending is attained depends on which path is chosen, how many times the player died, and how many mini-bosses and bosses were not destroyed in time. Be aware that there might be more ways to receive these endings than those listed below.Attaining the EndingThe EndingFinish the game.Proco and Tiat (the series' main characters) regain their old home planet of Darius, but the enemy fleet is approaching the new home planet of Orga. Proco and Tiat turn around and travel back with light speed.Taking the path ACDFHKL.Proco and Tiat regain their old home planet Darius. The text reads:[CR]Our craft, the silver hawk, has now fulfilled it's mission and will rest awhile... until it is summoned again to the far reaches of our galaxy.

Now we allied forces are on our way to the enemy planet in order to defeat them and regain peace and order in the galaxy.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]David Crane's Amazing Tennis is a tennis simulation game from Absolute Entertainment and Imagineering for the Genesis and Super Nintendo platforms. Legendary game designer David Crane, creator of Pitfall, lends his name to this trailblazing take on a truly 3D version of tennis in which the camera behind the court and players can move on a z-axis to simulate depth of field, rather than having a fixed bird's eye view of the court as was the standard at the time. The game's realism also demands greater accuracy from the player, with them having to choose the right moment to serve the ball and return volleys.[CR]The single-player mode has a selection of fictional seeded tennis players to compete against on grass, clay or hard courts in single matches or in tournaments. There is also a two-player mode available for both console versions. Regardless of how many human players are playing, the serving player is always in the foreground with the receiving player in the far background.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Demolition Man is a game based on the 1993 movie by the same name. As with the movie, the game takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles, in 1996. John Spartan is the countrys most fearsome cop and hunts his nemesis, Simon Phoenix. However in doing so, he kills several innocent civilians and both characters are sentenced to cryostasis rehabilitation where they will be brainwashed for 30 years. However the brainwashing does not go as planned and upon waking up, Phoenix goes on a new crime spree. However in 30 years the world has also changed and Los Angeles has become San Angeles, a utopian and violence-free society. As a remnant of a more violent past, police officer John Spartan is once again sent to capture Phoenix.[CR]Demolition Man is a fast-paced platform game, with some levels taking place in an overhead perspective (similar to Smash TV). As John Spartan, the player will spend most of his time shooting endless waves of "cryocons" released upon the antiseptic world of the future. The standard weapon can be upgraded with a shotgun and magnum, both with limited ammo. Additionally, various types of grenades can be collected, which are thrown independently of the firearm. Simon Phoenix appears as a boss character at the end of every level that is directly tied in with the movie.[CR]The Sega CD version of the game retains identical levels and gameplay, but adds digitized clips from the film to introduce levels and advance the plot.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Cheat Codes[CR]During gameplay, pause the game and enter one of the following codes for the desired affect:</plot>

				<title_clean>Demon's Crest</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Demon's Crest Title Card[CR]Developed and published by Capcom and released in 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Demon's Crest is the third iteration in the Gargoyle's Quest franchise, an offshoot of the popular Ghosts 'n Goblins series. As was the case with the series' previous titles, Gargoyle's Quest and Gargoyle's Quest II: The Demon Darkness, Demon's Crest is a side-scrolling platform game which places players in the role of the anti-hero Firebrand, a member of the very same Red Arremer demon clan often found antagonizing the valiant Arthur in the Ghost 'n Goblin franchise. Its gameplay utilizes mechanics commonly seen in Metroidvania action-adventure games, such as areas which are inaccessible until later upgrades are obtained, and furthermore it shares similarities with Capcom's own Mega Man series, as evidenced by its level selection mechanics and bosses, which often become much easier to defeat with certain weapons. In addition, the game features a rudimentary economy that allows Firebrand to purchase spells and potions with currency found within destructible environmental items or after defeating opponents. In a similar fashion to the Metroid series, Demon's Crest features multiple endings which unfurl differently depending upon the player's item collection percentage at the time they choose to access the game's final battle against Phalanx, which opens up fairly early on.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]In a time long past, the world was divided into two realms, with one realm ruled by man, and the other the dominion of demons. For many years the two kingdoms were peaceful, until one fateful day six powerful crests fell from the sky into the demons' lands. The demons began to fight amongst themselves over the control of these mysterious artifacts, as it was rumored their combined magics were sufficient to make those who possessed them powerful beyond measure. Eventually, a single red demon by the name of Firebrand proved to be more cunning and vicious than his brethren, securing the Crests of Fire, Earth, Air, Water, and Time for himself. Not content to have only five of the six crests, however, Firebrand challenged the demon dragon Somulo for possession of the final crest, the Crest of Heaven. The ensuing battle tested both combatants to their limits, but ultimately the demon dragon succumbed, and Firebrand emerged as the undisputed master of the crests.Phalanx obtains the coveted crests.[CR]Firebrand's control over the six crests was brief, however. Taking to the skies following his battle with Somulo, Firebrand finds himself attacked unexpectedly by another of his kind, the scheming Phalanx, who took advantage of his weakened state in order to pry the crests from him. Though his exact motives are unclear, Phalanx harbors ambitions of ruling over both the human and demon realms, and he knows that the crests will give him the power to do so. Phalanx successfully wrests all six crests from his wounded opponent, though a single shard of the Crest of Fire, which splintered into five pieces during the fight, still remains in Firebrand's possession at the end of their confrontation.[CR]Defeated but still alive, Firebrand swears to take revenge against the opportunistic Phalanx and reacquire the crests. His vengeance will not be easy, though. Wary that some jealous demon would come to take the crests from him in the same manner that he took them from Firebrand, Phalanx separates the crests and spreads them arcross the demon realm, keeping only the Crest of Heaven on his person. Before he can properly challenge Phalanx for the Crest of Heaven, Firebrand must first search the land for the four hidden crests while also recovering the shattered remnants of the Crest of Fire. Time is of the essence. Phalanx intends to use the six crests to create the Crest of Infinity, which would make him unstoppable. Only the small sliver of the Crest of Fire which remains in Firebrand's possession prevents him from doing so.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The main action of Demon's Crest takes place on traditional side-scrolling levels, many of which contain archetypal stage themes (fire level, water level, ice level, etc.), in which players must travel from left to right, defeating or avoiding enemies, navigating environmental hazards like spikes and flames, and occasionally squaring off against bosses. While the game's introductory stage is predetermined, after its completion players are allowed to choose their next location by flying Firebrand there via an overworld, which essentially acts as a level selection interface. Important locations (that is, those that are tied to the player's main quest) are marked on the map in order to indicate their significance, while a number of other secondary shops and hidden locales can be access through exploration. While accessible stages can be played in any order, their difficulty, and thus their intended order of completion, is signified by a numeric indicator on the game's world map. Progress is furthermore gated by levels which will only unlock once certain conditions have been met within the currently available levels.Firebrand performs a flyby over Phalanx's Tower.[CR]The main reward of level completion comes in the form of upgrades to the player character, Firebrand. Bosses typically yield boons such as crests, new abilities, or health upgrades upon defeat, and the levels themselves often hide additional items such as talismans, which provide passive benefits, as well as urns and vellum, which can be used for potions and spellcasting respectively. Many levels include branching pathways which encourage additional playthroughs, and it is often necessary to revisit earlier levels with abilities acquired later on, as completion of certain side paths may be extremely difficult or entirely impossible without a particular item. Once a player has completed a certain amount of the game, the Tower of Phalanx is unlocked. From that point forward, the player is free to engage the game's final battle when they see fit. Players who resist the urge to challenge Phalanx immediately are rewarded with better endings and the possibility of additional post-ending content based on their completion percentage upon finishing the final battle.[CR]When not tackling the game's main stages, the player can access several non-combat areas via the overworld. These mostly consist of shops which allow players to purchase one-time use potions and spells for Firebrand with currency gathered throughout the game. Additional urns and vellum increase the maximum number of potions and spells that can be stored at one time, though ultimately gold is also required in order to purchase them. Outside of purchasing items, activities in these neutral areas is somewhat limited. A few non-player characters can be engaged with, and an additional headbutting mini-game can be played for fun and profit. It is in the player's best interest to use what currency they find, as the game's password system does not carry over money or consumable items when continuing a game.[CR]Fire Crest Projectiles[CR]Normal Gargoyle[CR]Broken into five pieces at the game's outset, the Crest of Fire is tied intrinsically to Firebrand's default form, the Normal Gargoyle. The player starts with only one fragment of the crest in their possession at the game's commencement, and unlike other crests, each additional piece of the Crest of Fire must be gathered individually before the crest can be considered whole. The basic abilities of his normal form include the use of his wings to hover after jumping, utilization of his talons to indefinitely cling to non-spiked wall surfaces, and headbutting, which breaks certain background items. These traits do not change with the acquisition of additional fire shards, nor does Firebrand's appearance, but new shards grant Firebrand access to additional projectiles while in his default state, each with their own properties. Only one of the available projectile types can be in active use at any given time, and furthermore these cannot be used concurrently with other crests, though players can cycle between the different projectile types at will through the game's menu.FireFire The fireball is a staple of the Red Arremer clan, and the only ability which Firebrand starts the game with. It is fairly weak, and has no special properties outside of causing damage, and thus is outshined by most later projectiles. It is more than enough to handle the game's early bosses, though, and is sufficient for breaking pots when in town or when one is otherwise not in harm's way.BusterBuster Obtained by defeating Ovununu, the Buster is a moderately damaging projectile attack which gives the appearance of being electrically charged. Outside of giving a damage boost over Fire, it is also a major exploratory tool. The Buster attack is the first weapon obtained that is capable of breaking through the stone barriers that populate many of the game's levels, barriers which can hide additional items and pathways to new areas and bosses.TornadoTornado One of two "specialty" weapons in the Fire category, Tornado is a fairly underwhelming as an offensive measure due to limited range and power, though up to two projectiles can be on-screen at once, which Firebrand can use as temporary platforms. Using the Tornado's platform property successfully can be somewhat tricky, however, and once the Crest of Air is obtained, it presents a much easier way to access most areas.ClawClaw The second of two specialty projectiles, the Claw attack adheres to any wall spikes it comes in contact with, converting them into safe surfaces for Firebrand to cling to. More so than the Tornado, the Claw's special property has limited practical use in most areas, and also like the Tornado, it is made more or less obsolete once the the player has access to the Crest of Air and its highly mobile Aerial Gargoyle form.Demon FireDemon Fire The most powerful projectile in the Fire category, Demon Fire is acquired late in the game after defeating Grewon, and, once received, it essentially outclasses all other Fire Crest projectiles, save for a few specialized instances. The Demon Fire projectile takes the form of a long, blue, dragon-like gout of flame with blazing red eyes.[CR]Crests of Power[CR]The Six Crests[CR]With the exception of the Fire shards, which change only his base projectile, each of the crests obtained by Firebrand over the course of his journey yields several tangible changes when used. Once an individual crest is found, Firebrand may use it at any later point to transform into a version of himself which is imbued with the powers of that particular crest. He may then stay in any of these forms indefinitely, though it is often prudent to switch between crests frequently depending on the situation. Additional forms grant abilities that Firebrand's default form does not have access to, and in fact many areas of the game are designed such that certain crests will be better suited than others.[CR]As powerful as they are, It is worth noting that switching to new forms may cause the player to lose abilities that are available to them in the default form. For instance, certain transformations are wingless, and therefor have no ability to hover, while several forms also lack Firebrand's basic headbutt ability, which is accessible to him from the start of the game. This means that it can sometimes be wise to fall back on Firebrand's basic gargoyle form, which has a more well-rounded set of abilities. This is especially true of forms which are more specialized in nature, such as the Tidal Gargoyle.Ground GargoyleCrest of Earth Received after the player's first confrontation with Arma, the Crest of Earth transforms Firebrand into a mighty Ground Gargoyle. The main attribute of this form is its superior strength, which is evidenced by Firebrand's ability to charge straight through certain obstacles while in it. The Ground Gargoyle form is also notable for having one of the more unique projectile properties in the game. While in the air, it flies in a horizontal line like all other projectiles, but on the ground, it closely follows the contours of the landscape instead.Aerial GargoyleCrest of Air The Crest of Air morphs Firebrand into the second of his alternate forms, the Aerial Gargoyle. Not surprisingly given its name and more avian appearance, the Aerial Gargoyle gives Firebrand mastery over the skies. In this form, he may not only hover, but also may gain altitude whilst hovering, making it possible to access nearly any part of a level. In addition, any areas or enemies that make use of heavy wind which might otherwise buffet the player will have no affect on Firebrand while using the Crest of Air.Tidal GargoyleCrest of Water Dominion over the powerful Tidal Gargoyle awaits any player lucky enough to capture the Crest of Water. While most forms sustain damage while submerged, the Tidal Gargoyle thrives underwater, gaining significant speed and a powerful attack. Additionally, certain underwater barriers can only be broken in this form. Until the Ultimate Gargoyle is unlocked upon defeating the game, the Tidal Gargoyle is the only form one should consider entering the water with.Legendary GargoyleCrest of Time Granting power over time itself, the Crest of Time transmogrifies Firebrand into the Legendary Gargoyle. He is in this form gifted with a powerful projectile attack, as well as amazing durability. The player only takes half of the normal damage they otherwise would while in Legendary form. Outside of these boosts, the Legendary Gargoyle behaves much more like Firebrand's default self than any of the previous forms, and is the first alternate form to have the headbutt ability.Ultimate GargoyleCrest of Heaven Obtained by defeating Phalanx, the Crest of Heaven is the ultimate crest acquired in the game, and fittingly grants Firebrand access to the Ultimate Gargoyle form. It does not disappoint, as it combines all of the powers accessible through the previous crests: the charge skill of the Crest of Earth, the sky mastery of the Crest of Air, the water affinity of the Crest of Water, and the damage mitigation of the Crest of Time. In fact, there is very little cause to use previous crests once the Crest of Heaven has been acquired.[CR]Spells[CR]The spell system on Demon's Crest is in place to allow players the means to create and cast various spells to augment their usual offensive abilities. Before a spell can be cast, Firebrand is first required to obtain vellum, which is essentially a blank scrap of parchment which a spell can be inscribed upon. Once a player possesses vellum, spells can be inscribed upon them by special vendors within the game world, provided the player has enough money for the particular spell. Once the spell has been used, the vellum returns to a blank state, and must be inscribed with a spell once again before it can be reused. The player can have up to five spells of their choosing at one time.ShadowShadow Invoking the Shadow spell conjures an ominous spectral barrier around Firebrand which grants him temporary protection from harm for a short time by boosting his defensive abilities. Given that the Armor talisman gives a constant defensive benefit, though, the utility of Shadow is somewhat lessened once it is obtained.HoldHold Casting the Hold spell inflicts temporary paralysis upon any enemies near to Firebrand. This can be useful mainly early on, when players have less mobility, though later transformations provide a significant amount of maneuverability, enough to make Hold somewhat less attractive.ImpImp The Imp spell summons a lesser demon to aid Firebrand for a time. This helper flies overhead, swooping in to attack any foes that close in on its master. Being a demon, the Imp is not without certain expectations of its host. Gold will constantly drain away from Firebrand as long as the Imp is present, and it will quickly abandon him should he run out of currency.ShockShock The Shock spell conjures a localized earthquake to damage enemies around Firebrand. The obvious downside to this incantation is that targets must touch the ground in order to sustain damage, thus the game's myriad airborne foes are essentially immune to its effects.DeathDeath Simply put, the Death spell kills any enemies on-screen at the time of its casting by calling forth Death itself. This is obviously most useful when there are a large number of foes within Firebrand's immediate vicinity, although certain boss monsters can also feel its effect.[CR]Potions[CR]The more defensive counterpart of the spell system, Demon's Crest's potion system operates in exactly the same fashion. Players are required before making a potion to collect at least a single urn, which acts as the vessel for a potion. With sufficient funds, players can then purchase potions from designated potion vendors in the game world in order to fill these urns. Each potion can be used only once before needing to be repurchased, and as with spells, a player can possess a maximum of five different potions at one time, depending on the number of urns they have collected. Only one potion or spell may be equipped at a given moment, and, once used, the player must manually equip a new one from their inventory in order to use it.MercuryMercury Quaffing the Mercury potion immediately transports the player back the to beginning of their current stage. This is of somewhat dubious usefulness, unfortunately, as only one stage allows the player access to the overworld from there, so in most cases this simply forces the player to replay their current stage.SulfurSulfur The Sulfur potion is a more useful version of the Mercury potion, transporting its imbiber to the overworld rather than the beginning of the stage. This can be handy when Firebrand is critically low on health, or when the player has accomplished their objective within a stage and has no need to continue.HerbHerb A basic healing potion, Herb restores five points to the player's health bar. While not nearly as useful as the Ginseng potion, it has the advantage of being a great deal less expensive, and early on, before Firebrand's health is upgraded, it can represent a full heal, or close to it.ElixirElixir The Elixir acts as an emergency restorative upon death, automatically reviving a downed player and granting them four points of health. While nice to have, it is worth pointing out that an Herb potion costs considerably less while also restoring more health, making an Elixir preferable only if one plans on being careless.GinsengGinseng The most useful potion during the late game, and accordingly the most expensive, the Ginseng potion restores Firebrand to full health. The cost can be hard to justify early on when Firebrand's pool of health is shallow, and Herb potions work nearly as well, but as the pool deepens, Ginseng's utility grows exponentially.[CR]Talismans[CR]The artifacts known as talismans are quite different from other Demon's Crest collectibles in that they are entirely passive. Talismans can be equipped from the inventory page much like potions or spells, but once done, they provide a constant benefit to the player which does not diminish over time. Each talisman must be found in the game world rather than bought, and though the unique properties of each are not immediately explained in-game, a certain helpful NPC will offer to explain the benefits of whichever talisman the player happens to have equipped.CrownCrown The Crown talisman significantly increases the probability of gold drops. This can be useful in many situations, such as when resuming a game through a password. Since continuing a game starts the player with no money, the Crown presents an easy way to quickly gather gold for potions and spells.SkullSkull Useful mostly during the early game, when overall health is low, the Skull talisman greatly improves the chances of health restoration drops. In most cases, having a good supply of potions on hand is a better way to restore health, but in their absence, the Skull can help keep Firebrand alive.ArmorArmor Likely to be the default talisman for most players, the Armor talisman bestows a significant amount of damage mitigation to its user. When combined with defense-boosting forms like the Legendary or Ultimate Gargoyle, Firebrand will be able to stand up to a fair amount of punishment.FangFang Armor's offensive counterpart, the Fang talisman boosts Firebrand's damage output considerably. For those who value finishing their enemies quickly more so than protecting themselves, it can be a more alluring option, especially if one has a deep stock of health potions to back it up.HandHand The Hand talisman increases Firebrand's damage by accelerating his rate of fire. It can be obtained earlier than either the Fang or Armor talismans, so until then it is more or less the de facto combat talisman. Once those talismans are available, though, the Hand becomes less of an asset.[CR]Mode 7[CR]Demon's Crest was another game which utilised the Mode 7 graphical mode of the Super Nintendo primarily for its world map.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Before the actual playing takes place, Dennis has just discovered that he left Mr. Wilson's door unlocked, and a thief has stolen Mr. Wilson's entire coin collection. Dennis must retrieve all of the coins before Mr. Wilson finds out. The games starts out in Mr. Wilson's house, in which there are 4 main coins that must be found. However, there are smaller coins which do not affect gameplay, only score. Once the four main coins are found, the final coin (which cannot be attained until the previous 4 coins are found) is touchable, leading Dennis onto the next stage. The next set of stages are given titles, with the naming process being as such: "Name #", replacing "Name" with the title of the set, and "#" with the subsequent level of the set (up to 6).[CR]The same coin-collection game is present throughout the rest of the game (with the exception of two stages in the first park stage set, wherein Dennis must traverse the park on a wagon led by his dog). After each sixth level, there is a boss stage, followed by a new set of levels. The sets of levels are, in order, Mr. Wilson's House, Park, Boiler Room, Sewers, and finally, Woods. The end of the woods levels, and the subsequent beating of the final boss, marks the end of the game.[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_the_Menace_(video_game)[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Desert Strike - Return to the Gulf</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Desert Strike: Return to the Gulf is an isometric helicopter shoot 'em up from Electronic Arts. The player is a fighter pilot who must take down mission-critical targets across a number of maps. The player is free to pursue these missions in any order, and must also keep an eye on the fuel, damage, and ammo gauges.[CR]Desert Strike is the first of the prolific Strike series, and was followed with Jungle Strike and Urban Strike on the Genesis. Two more games, Soviet Strike and Nuclear Strike, were released later for 32-bit systems.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]A year after the Gulf War, General Ibn Kilbaba takes over a small Arab emirate and plans to start World War III. Using an AH-64 Apache, the player must open the way for ground troops and finally take on the "Madman" himself.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is played from an isometric perspective in open levels that allow free movement in all directions by scrolling the screen with the movement of the helicopter. Each level consists of many varying objectives that range anywhere from destroying enemy bases and vehicles to capturing enemy troops or rescuing friendly ones. While bases and vehicles are simply destroyed, both friendly and enemy troops must be taken back to base for extraction. The AH-64 Apache has limited cargo space, so multiple trips to and from the base may be necessary. These objectives aren't always linear, and can often be tackled in whatever order the player chooses. This combination of free movement and non-linear structure separated Desert Strike from many of the other contemporary shooters.[CR]There are three weapons of varying strength and usefulness available to the AH-64 Apache: machine guns, hydra missiles, and hellfire missiles, which increase in strength respectively. Each of these weapons has a limited number of ammo which can only be replenished by picking up ammo crates on the mission or by resupplying back at the base. Similarly, the AH-64 Apache only has a limited amount of fuel that will drain slowly over the course of each level. If the fuel runs out, the helicopter crashes and the player loses a life. Refueling works exactly the same as restocking ammo.[CR]Lives are lost when either the AH-64 Apache takes too much damage and is destroyed, or when it runs out of fuel. After three lives have been lost, the game is over. Due to the nature of the game's freedom, each level requires a certain amount of planning and strategy in order to complete all of the objectives while still having enough fuel, ammo, and health to survive.[CR]Ports[CR]Due to its popularity on the Sega Genesis in 1992, the game was then ported to the Amiga, Master System, and SNES in the same year. Two years later in 1994, it was released on the PC. It was also ported to most handheld systems such as the Lynx in 1993, Game Gear in 1994, Game Boy in 1995, Game Boy Advance in 2002, and finally the PSP in 2006 as part of EA Replay.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]Enter the following password:</plot>

				<title_clean>Dino City</title_clean>
				<plot>DinoCity is a traditional platformer-style action game where the player must move their character from left to right across the screen while avoiding obstacles, jumping on platforms, and defeating enemies.[1] Players are given the choice of controlling Rex with Timmy or Tops with Jamie at the beginning of the game as well as at the start of each new level. While Tops can throw darts to damage enemies from a distance, Rex is confined to close combat by punching them or swinging his tail.[2] Each dinosaur character can defeat enemies by jumping on them, and at any point the player may relegate control to their human riders, who can freeze enemies in place by using a special energy device. While controlling the children, the dinosaurs become immobile and may be used as platforms themselves to reach otherwise inaccessible items. The game supports up to two players who are given alternating turns at play each time the other loses a life.[CR]In order to pass each of the game's six levels, players must navigate through a number of screens joined by doors. Each screen resembles a different environment, and can include caves, jungles, grasslands, or ice caverns. Once a player has passed enough screens they must battle a boss character before advancing. If a character loses enough lives, they are given the option to continue up to three times before the game is over. During gameplay a player may collect eggs which grant an extra life if enough are obtained, as well as hearts that restore lost health. The game utilizes a password system that allows players to return to the start of any level from the title screen.[CR]Level Passwords:[CR]8SHTK$S3HNDM 2[CR]HF4N&lt;NBC41KT 3[CR]5SKXT$S9HNZ4 4[CR]XKC5T$SWHNN4 5[CR]5CX6D$SOHF94 6[CR]8SSZ9ESOH4H4 Final Stage[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DinoCity[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Select[CR]Press R + Down, Up, R + Right, B + Up, L + Right, A + Right, X + Right, Y + Up, A + Left, Select + Left, L + Left, Select + Down at the title screen.

				<plot>Dirt Trax Fx is a Motocross racing game in which players can choose between 8 drivers, differing in top speed, acceleration, turning and braking, to compete on 22 different tracks. The tracks feature lots of mounds, ramps, pits and other similar obstacles. Parts of a track might also be covered in water mud or ice. To successfully navigate the motorbike through these obstacles, the shoulder buttons can be used to lean the bike, while pressing up or down changes the angle of the bike. Before the game begins, players can choose between four different bikes ranging from 50cc to 500cc (the last bike needs to be unlocked first). The choice of the bike greatly affects the game's speed as well as the overall difficulty.[CR]Apart from the main race, there is also a "Rad Tag" mode. In this mode, a timer ticks down that can only be stopped by hitting the opponent. The driver whose timer reaches zero first loses.</plot>

				<title_clean>Donkey Kong Country</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The title screen[CR]The first in the Donkey Kong Country series of video games, Donkey Kong Country is a classic side-scrolling platformer featuring Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong. Among the first games to fully utilize pre-rendered 3D graphics for its sprite-based system, this game, and its sequels, was notable both for its particular brand of action platforming and its impressive, lush visuals. Donkey kong Country was developed by Rare and published by Nintendo.[CR]A version called "Donkey Kong Country: Competition Cartridge" was released within the same year as the original game's release. This was a very limited release for certain video game competitions during the 1990s such as the Blockbuster Video World Championship II in 1995.[CR]This version of the game is quite different from the original as it is only playable for five minutes. Within that time limit, the player must gain as many points as possible. There is no title screen, save files, or world map in the game; the player instantly starts on the first level when the cartridge is inserted into the console. When one level is completed, the next level starts. The following levels that the game goes through is Jungle Hijinx, Reptile Rumble, Ropey Rampage, Coral Capers, Winky's Walkway, Bouncy Bonanza, Orang-Utan Gang, and Snow Barrel Blast. At the end of the 5 minutes, the game freezes at its current state in order to allow time for the referee of the competition to take note of the points.A screenshot from the Game Boy Color version[CR]A Game Boy Color port was released on November 4th, 2000. This is essentially the same game, except with some mini-games thrown in. Naturally, the graphics aren't as impressive as the SNES version and the game would begin to slow down to a crawl when there were more than a few sprites on screen at once, but was still considered a technological marvel being able to port a SNES game to Game Boy Color, with the core concepts being intact. There are a few other differences in the game, for example, only one character is onscreen at a time. Also, when an animal character is gained, Diddy or Donkey Kong will leave and the player gets to play as the animal as opposed to Diddy or Donkey Kong. The Game Boy Color version's music was mostly ported over from the eight bit soundtrack of Donkey Kong Land, although certain tracks had been switched around, such as DKL's water level music now being used for an ice cavern level.[CR]The game featured an additional cave level in the Chimp Caverns world, Necky Nutmare. It also featured a scrapbook which the player could fill up by finding extra hidden items in the adventure before printing out the pages, as well as a few minigames: a fishing game with Funky Kong, a barrel- Kremling coconut-shooter with Cranky, as well as some small bonus games with Candy Kong since her save room was unnecessary now that the game autosaved after each level was completed.[CR]Released on June 9th, 2003, Donkey Kong Country on the Game Boy Advance is a very faithful remake of the original. In this game the same various extras of the Game Boy Color version were added; the mini-games and scrapbook where the player had to find hidden scrapbook pieces throughout the game to unlock concept art. The player was also allowed to save after every level, and was able to see their progress on each individual level as well (if they had found the KONG letters, bonus levels, and scrapbook pieces.) A "Hero" mode could also be unlocked by achieving at least a 90% completion rate. This was essentially a hard mode, where the player could only play as Diddy Kong in a yellow color swap suit. There were no D.K. barrels in this mode. The graphics in the Game Boy Advance version are a lot closer to the original than the Game Boy Color adaption, although some of the parralax backgrounds, map details and sprite resolutions have been downgraded, and the weather effects present in some levels from the original were taken out.[CR]The Wii Virtual Console version of Donkey Kong Country is an emulated port of the original game; version 1.3 for NTSC gamers and 1.1 for PAL gamers. As such some players may notice slight differences to their cartridge copy, but otherwise the game is a faithful port. It was released in the U.S. on February 19th, 2007.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The game's storyline was characteristically sparse, in keeping with most games of the time period. Essentially, Donkey Kong's banana hoard has been stolen by King K. Rool, who has appeared on a ship with his reptilian Kremling crew. Along with Diddy Kong, Donkey Kong must fight through several worlds to King K. Rool's ship to fight him and recover his bananas. Other Kong members also help Donkey and Diddy along the way by either offering tips, saving their game or flying the Kongs back to previously visited areas.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Donkey Kong riding on Rambi the Rhino[CR]Compared to Mario's arsenal, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong have rather few moves available to them at the core. They are capable simply of walking, running, performing a rolling attack, and jumping. However, Donkey Kong Country featured a strong level of interaction with the environment, which greatly multiplied the gameplay possibilities in the game: ropes could be swung on, bouncy tires could be rolled or jumped on, and a vast array of various barrels could be picked up, thrown, or busted on enemies' heads. Still other barrels, called barrel cannons or blast barrels, floated in midair and could be leapt into, upon which depending on the type of barrel, either pressing a button or immediately upon entry, the player is blasted out of the end of the barrel. Often times, these barrels moved or rotated along paths, creating timing exercises which must be mastered to progress in the game.[CR]The primary method for dispatching enemies is to jump on them, or to toss barrels into them. Most enemies may also be put out of commission with a rolling attack as well, but some have defenses in this direction. While both Diddy Kong and Donkey Kong may appear on the screen at the same time, only one is actually controlled by the player; should the active character be injured, the inactive character will become playable. Should there be no inactive player, the player loses a life and must start the level over, either from the beginning or the midway checkpoint. Falling into pits results in instant death.[CR]There are also animal buddies in the game, which are found in crates and which the active character may ride to gain access to special abilities. These animal buddies and their abilities are listed below in the characters section.[CR]There are many secret areas in Donkey Kong Country, which may be found by blasting away walls with tough blows from barrels and rhinoceros horns, or jumping in spots above or below the screen to hidden barrels. These secret areas usually contain a chance to earn either extra lives or animal buddy tokens. Collecting three of the same type of animal buddy token will allow the player to play a different sort of bonus level, in which there is a set amount of time to gather as many tokens as the player can while playing as the animal buddy in question--every 100 tokens collected results in one extra life earned. There are also hidden giant tokens in these levels which, upon collection, will split into many smaller tokens to be collected as well as doubling the player's current token score.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The KongsCharacterDescriptionDonkey KongOne of the two primary protagonists, Donkey Kong is a large gorilla who is ideal for tackling larger enemies due to his greater mass and strength. In addition to his rolling attack, he also has an additional special attack if the player holds down on the directional pad and then press the attack button.Diddy KongThe other primary playable character, Diddy Kong is faster and more agile than Donkey Kong. His special attack is a cartwheel which can knock down bigger enemies where jumping on them does no harm.Cranky KongCranky Kong provides "advice" throughout the game to the player and the two younger Kongs. According to the story, Cranky Kong was actually Donkey Kong in the original arcade version of Donkey Kong. This would mean that the Donkey Kong the player controls now is essentially Donkey Kong Jr. from the original arcade games.Candy KongCandy Kong may be visited to save the game, and in the Game Boy Color version, provides Mini Games to obtain tokens.She serves as Donkey Kong's love interest.Funky KongFunky Kong allows the player to transfer between the worlds in the game.The Good GuysCharacterDescriptionEnguarde the SwordfishA fish who can swim underwater, Enguarde enables the Kongs to kill fish and bash into walls through a charging attack.Expresso the OstrichExpresso runs extremely fast, and can sustain limited flight, allowing the Kongs to glide much further through the air than they could do on their own. his tall legs allow him to run over small enemies without being hurt.Rambi the RhinoRambi is large and heavy, making him unwieldy for platforming, but excellent for bowling over foes. He also has a charge attack.SquawksSquawks the Parrot may not provide transportation for the Kongs as in later games; instead, the parrot holds a flashlight to illuminate the way for the player in dark levels.WinkyWinky is capable of jumping extremely high. However, his awkward motion makes him rather imprecise for difficult platforming.The Bad GuysArmyGnawtyManky KongMini-NeckyNeckySlippaZingerThe Aquatic Bad GuysBitesizeChompsChomps Jr.ClamboCroctopusSquidgeThe KremlingsKlaptrapKlumpKrashKritterKrushaRockkrocThe BossesVery GnawtyMaster NeckyQueen B.Really GnawtyDumb DrumMaster Necky Snr.King K.

				<title_clean>Donkey Kong Country 2 - Diddy's Kong Quest</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest a 2D platformer released in 1995 for the SNES, developed by Rare and published by Nintendo. The game consists of many levels divided into different worlds ending with boss battles. As the player clears more and more worlds they'll climb higher and higher on the island called Crocodile Isle until they reach the final boss, Kaptain K. Rool. All the worlds look very different and they all have their own themes. The game also contains multiple bonus stages and secret levels giving the game more diversity than it's sequel.[CR]DKC2 has sold almost 4.4 million copies (making it the 6th best-selling game for SNES) and was released on the Wii Virtual Console on May 21, 2007 for 800 points. It has also been ported to the Game Boy Advance with notable changes in the gameplay, added levels, and an extra boss.[CR]It's worth noting that the grammatically incorrect title is a play on words. The title can be read either as Diddy's Kong Quest or Diddy's Conquest.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story begins as Diddy Kong discovers a ransom note left by long-time villain King K. Rool (now going by Kaptain K. Rool) demanding that the banana horde stolen by the Kong gang in the previous game be returned, in exchange for Donkey Kong. Diddy and his girlfriend Dixie Kong must run, roll and jump their way through the many stages set on Crocodile Isle and the various bosses sent at them from K. Rool. The duo must occasionally call upon their gang of Animal Buddies introduced in the previous game to make their way across more difficult areas.[CR]ItemsBananas: A common item in the DKC universe that come in singles and bunches of 10. Collecting 100 bananas will earn the player an extra life.Banana Coins: Used as currency to purchase services from various members of the Kong family (i.e. Swanky Kong's Bonus Bonanza). In the Game Boy Advance version they can also be used to fight a rematch against a defeated boss. They can be found throughout most of the levels of the game.Kremkoins: Used to bribe Klubba into allowing Diddy and Dixie access to the Lost World. These are given as rewards for completing bonus games that are accessed via bonus barrels. Typically there are two to three bonus barrels to be found in each level.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Kong FamilyDixie Kong: Diddy Kong's girlfriend and one of the protagonists of the game. Dixie is slower than Diddy but can twirl her long ponytail to slow her decent helping her reach further distances. She can also use her pony tail to defeat enemies.Diddy Kong: Donkey Kong's sidekick and boyfriend of Dixie Kong. Diddy Kong is quick and can use a cartwheel attack to defeat enemies.Cranky Kong: Donkey Kong's father and the original Donkey Kong from the arcade game. He helps Diddy and Dixie by giving them tips and hints on levels. He is also the host of the minigame Expresso Racing in the Game Boy Advance version.Wrinkly Kong: Wife of Cranky Kong. She provides a place for Diddy and Dixie to save their game.Funky Kong: Owner of the Funky Flights service which allows Diddy and Dixie to travel to other areas of Crocodile Isle.Swanky Kong: Host of the game show Swanky's Bonus Bonanza where Diddy and Dixie can earn extra lives by answering quiz questions.Candy Kong: Only appears in the Game Boy Advance version as Swanky's assistant.Animal BuddiesRambi: A rhinoceros who also appeared in the original Donkey Kong Country. Rambi is able to use his horn to ram into enemies and has the ability to jump on any type of enemy (including Zingers) without getting hurt. He can also use a special charge attack which increases his speed for a short amount of time and gives him the ability to destroy breakable walls revealing secrets.Enguarde: A swordfish who, like Rambi, also appears in the first game. Also like Rambi, Enguarde possesses a special charge attack that increases his speed for a short amount of time and gives him the ability to destroy breakable walls. He can also use his pointy nose to pierce enemies.Squawks: A parrot who also appears in the original game. Squawks can fly and is able to attack enemies by shooting pellets out of his mouth. He can also aid the Kongs by holding a lantern in his talons to light up dark areas.Rattly: A Rattlesnake who makes his debut appearance in Donkey Kong Country 2. He can jump high and reach areas that the Kongs cannot. His special move is a charge jump that gives him the ability to jump extra high. He can jump on enemies to defeat them and, like Rambi, can jump on any type of enemy.Squitter: A spider who also makes his debut in this game. Squitter has the ability to create platforms made out of web helping him cross large gaps or reach new heights. He also has a web attack that can be used to defeat enemies, and he cannot jump on enemies without getting hurt.Clapper: A seal who, in Lava levels, can cool down the water for a short period of time making it safe to swim in for the Kongs. In one other level he actually freezes the water instead of cooling it down. This allows the Kongs to travel over the water avoiding the Snapjaws who lurk in the waterExpresso II: Not to be confused with the animal buddy named Expresso, Expresso II is an ostrich who is exclusive to the Game Boy Advance version of the game. Cranky Kong bought Expresso II in hopes of turning him into a racing bird. However, he starts out very weak and in order to build up his stats and increase his size the Kongs must collect golden feathers. Once he is strong enough he can be used to race against other ostriches in the minigame Expresso Racing.Glimmer: An angelfish who only appears in one level. He helps light the way for the Kongs in the dark waters of Glimmer's Galleon.Flapper: A parrot who is similar in appearance to Squawks except he is blue instead of green. Like Glimmer, Flapper only appears in one level where he helps the Kong descend through a hive of Zingers.BossesKrow: The boss of Gangplank Galleon, Krow is a large Mini Necky who wears a pirate hat. Krow will first attempt to drop an egg on the Kongs, then attempt to ram into them. He can be damaged by throwing his own eggs back at him. After taking a few hits he will begin ramming into his nest causing several eggs to fall out of it which can hurt the Kongs if they come into contact with them.Kleever: The boss of Crocodile Cauldron, Kleever is a giant sword who is possessed by a lava spirit. Kleever will attack the Kongs by throwing fireballs at them and after a set a number of fireballs have been thrown and cannonball will spawn. This cannonball can be thrown at Kleever to damage him. After being hit several hooks will appear spreading out along the top of the screen and Kleever will begin chasing after the Kongs attempting to slash them. The hooks can be used to avoid this attack.Kudgel: The boss of Krem Quay, Kudgel is a large kremling who looks similar to Klubba. He jumps into the air and attempts to land on the Kongs, when he lands he creates a shockwave which can paralyze the Kongs for a short period of time if they do not jump to avoid it. After doing this a few times he will swing his club then do a small jump which makes a TNT barrel appear. This barrel can be thrown at Kudgel to damage him. When low on health he will begin doing shorter jumps in quicker succession.King Zing: The boss of Krazy Kremland, King Zing is a giant Zinger who is fought using the animal buddy Squawks. In the first phase of the fight he will fly around the room in a pattern, Squawks can hurt him by firing a pellet at his stinger. Once hit he well turn red (making him temporarily invincible) and fire 3 sets of spikes in all directions. After a number of hits, the second phase of the fight will begin. King Zing turn into a normal sized red Zinger and he will be surrounded by normal Zingers. In order to make him vulnerable to attacks, all the Zingers surrounding him must be defeated. Once they are defeated King Zing will turn yellow and can be finished off.Kreepy Krow: The boss of Gloomy Gulch, Kreepy Krow is the undead ghost of the first boss in the game, Krow. He summons three ghost Mini Neckies to attack the Kongs, then one real one. After the Kongs defeat the real Mini Necky a barrel will appear that can be thrown at Kreepy Krow to hurt him. After he his hit he will fly upwards and the Kongs must climb up a ways to reach him. While climbing up, eggs will be falling from the sky which can hurt the Kongs. This pattern is repeated until the Kongs reach the top of his nest where one more hit will defeat him.Kaptain K. Rool: The final boss and main antagonist of the game, Kaptain K. Rool is King K. Rool in disguise. He attacks the Kongs by shooting cannon balls from his gun in various patterns and by sliding from one side of the room to the other. He can be hurt by throwing one of his cannonballs back into his gun causing it to explode in his face. After he is defeated Donkey Kong will break free from his ropes and uppercut King K. Rool into the waters of the Lost World. After beating all the levels of the Lost World, the Kongs can battle King K. Rool again and defeat him for good.MiscellaneousKlubba: A large kremling who guards the entrance to the Lost World. He can be bribed with fifteen Kremkoins in order to gain entrance to the Lost World.

				<title_clean>Donkey Kong Country 3 - Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble is the third and final instalment of the DKC Trilogy. It was developed once again by Rare. In this last edition, neither Donkey Kong nor Diddy Kong are playable. Instead, the playable characters Dixie Kong (from DKC 2) and her cousin Kiddy Kong, who is a new playable character.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong decide to take a fishing vacation after their hard work on keeping DK Isles safe from the clutches of K. Rool. But they mysteriously go missing and it's up to Dixie Kong and her cousin, Kiddy, to find them. Meanwhile, in the northern Kremisphere, the kremlings are back once again but now under the leadership of KAOS, a mysterious robot that is secretly being controlled by one Baron K. Roolenstein. Its up to Dixie and Kiddy to rescue Donkey and Diddy Kong and thwart K. Roolenstein's evil plans.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Boss Time![CR]Donkey Kong Country 3 retains the same gameplay from the previous two installments but with some new additions. One of the new additions is the use of vehicles on the world map screen. Unlike the plane used in the previous games, these vehicles range from a motorboat to a helicopter and help Dixie and Kiddy Kong get to different locations throughout the northern Kremisphere, as well as secret places that would be unreachable otherwise.[CR]The two kongs make their way through various levels like woodland areas and mechanical factories picking up all sorts of items along the way whether it be bananas, coins or balloons representing extra lives. They are once again aided by animals to guide them in defeating the kremling krew and other enemies that are about.[CR]In this edition, the Kong family are joined by the Brothers Bears who are situated all throughout the northern Kremisphere. They have their own dilemmas and will help Dixie and Kiddy in their adventures in exchange for bear coins and certain items found throughout the world.[CR]Hidden throughout the northern Kremisphere are caves that contain an important part of the game, banana birds. In order to free the birds from their crystallised cages, the Kongs have to match the sequence of sounds that play for them when they enter the cave. Some are given to them by the bears in exchange for helping them out. In order to unlock the true ending, the player must obtain all 13 banana birds throughout the land.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]Dixie Kong - Girlfriend of Diddy Kong who can use her ponytail to glide along and reach certain places throughout the land.[CR]Kiddy Kong - Cousin of Dixie Kong who can use his weight to his advantage in certain scenarios.[CR]Supporting Characters[CR]The Kong FamilyWrinkly Kong - Having quit her job as a school teacher, Wrinkly now spends her time exercising, sleeping and playing games in her cave.

It features a brand new world, Pacifica, as well as a new boss, Kroctopus.[CR]The game also sported a completely new soundtrack from David Wise, composer for Donkey Kong Country 2, although the music has been criticised for not holding up to that of the original by Eveline Fischer (now Novakovic).[CR]The port has also replaced the original Swanky Sideshow minigames with some new boat games from Funky, a star-collection game set in a sewer tube with Swanky, and an echidna-blocking game with Cranky Kong. Wrinkly's save caves have been replaced by Cranky's Dojo now that the game allows the player to save at any time on the world map by hitting the start button.[CR]The port has slightly changed physics from the original game which may be noticeable when playing them side by side; most notably that characters will move at a much slower rate in the port, including in the toboggan levels. There are also a few levels which have had objects shifted to fit with these slower character speeds, but sometimes this affects the original puzzles of levels, such as platforms being lowered to be accessible from points unreachable before, and some DK coins being accessible without figuring out a puzzle and collecting them the way the game had originally intended.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The soundtrack for Donkey Kong Country 3 was the first soundtrack in the Donkey Kong Country series to not be solely composed by David Wise. Instead, Eveline Fischer was responsible for most of the composition with some help by David Wise.TracklistSoundtrack coverDixie BeatCrazy CalypsoNorthern KremisphereHangin' at Funky'sWrinkly's Save CaveGet Fit A-Go-GoWrinkly 64Brothers BearSub-Map ShuffleSwanky's SideshowCranky's ShowdownShowdown WinShowdown LoseBonus TimeBonus WinBonus LoseStilt VillageMill FeverJangle BellsFrosty FrolicsTreetop TumbleEnchanted RiverbankHot PursuitWater WorldNuts and BoltsPokey PipesRockface RumbleJungle JitterCavern CapriceRocket RunBoss BoogieCrystal ChasmKrematoa KoncertoBig Boss BluesMama BirdChaseBaddies on ParadeGame Over[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Unlock Lost World[CR]To unlock Lost World, using the jet ski or hovercraft, swim several clockwise circles around four rocks (On the first section of the map) for as many times as you can, until Lost World forms.</plot>

				<title_clean>Doom</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Doom is a science-fiction/horror first-person shooter developed and published by id for the PC on December 10, 1993. As a nameless space marine, players trek through 27 levels (split up into three episodes), where they liberate space stations from demon infestation in both Phobos and Deimos, only to take on Hell. The game's engine (later known as id Tech 1) is known to pioneer new features to the genre, including non-perpendicular walls, complex rooms (known as "sectors") with varying height differences, multiplayer (both co-operatively and competitively, for up to four players at a time) and the concept of packaging the game's content (levels, sounds, and music) into singular files (WAD files) for easier modification and distribution (leading to the birth of the modern mod-making community).[CR]The lore of the game, set sometime into the future, involves the Union Aerospace Corporation (U.A.C.), a multi-planetary conglomerate that has been utilized by the Earth military to secretly experiment on alien teleportation technology discovered on the moons of Mars. As they try to establish a gateway between the two moons using this technology, the experiment goes awry and the demons of Hell use the portals to invade the two moons. As the last man standing guarding the Hangar of the U.A.C. space station on Phobos, the lone space marine must fight through the onslaught to keep them from attacking Earth.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Doom, players progress through each level, blasting away enemies while solving puzzles (involving switches, keycards, and skull-shaped key devices), avoiding environmental hazards (such as crushing ceilings, radioactive acid, and burning lava), and collecting weapons, ammo, and other items (including first-aid kits, body armor, suits that protect from radiation, night-vision goggles, computer maps, and supernatural orbs that grant a special bonus to the player). Unlike id's previous first-person shooter, Spear of Destiny, Doom does not include a scoring or lives system. Players who die can retry the level at the cost of resetting their inventory and stats.Episodes and Difficulties[CR]The game's campaign is split up into three episodes (each with eight normal levels and one secret level):Knee-Deep in the Dead - The only episode playable in the shareware version, the first episode deals with the marine's journey through the base established on Phobos.The Shores of Hell - After defeating the two big bruisers guarding the teleportation gateway, the marine passes through into Deimos. As the invasion continues, the base becomes more distorted with hellish architecture. The second episode deals with the marine's liberation of demons from the Deimos base.[CR]Inferno - Eventually, the marine fights a giant anomaly of flesh and metal (known as the Cyberdemon) in the "Tower of Babel", only to find out Deimos has been teleported to the infernal afterlife, and that the tower connects the moon to Hell itself! The third (and final) episode has the marine blindly wreaking havoc in Hell until he can find the mastermind behind the invasion.[CR]Players who are starting a new game can start at the beginning of an episode (starting with no armor and a pistol with 50 bullets). Starting from the second episode, players can find two new cell energy weapons (the uncommon Plasma Gun and the rare BFG-9000) and two new common enemies (the Cacodemon and the Lost Soul). Players can pick between five (four before game version 1.2) difficulties (known as "skill levels"):I'm too young to die. - Fewer monsters (and more items) than normal. Double ammo granted on weapon and ammo pickups. Players take half damage.Hey, not too rough. - Fewer monsters (and more items) than normal.Hurt me plenty. - Normal difficulty.Ultra-Violence. - More monsters (and fewer items) than normal.Nightmare! - Added in v1.2. Cheat codes are disabled. More monsters (and fewer items) than normal. Double ammo granted on weapon and ammo pickups. Monsters react and move faster, and respawn shortly after death.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]FistFistDamage: 10 per punch, 200 with Berserk PackOne of two starting weapons. The fist is simple and effective against weaker enemies but when a Berserk Pack power up is activated it boosts the attack power of the fist considerably allowing you to tear through and even gib many enemies with ease.From the manual: Can be used to punch enemies.

Shoot it and see for yourself.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Former HumanHealth: 20Total in single player (ultra violence) : 311From the manual: Once a marine, always a marine-- except in this case. These guys may look like your old buddies, but now they're nothing more than pistol-toting bi-pedal maggots. Waste em!Former Human SergeantHealth: 30Total in single player (ultra violence) : 426From the manual: Ditto. Except these guys are meaner and tougher. These walking shotguns will provide you with a few extra holes if you're not careful.ImpHealth: 60Total in single player (ultra violence) : 719From the manual: You though an imp was a cute little dude in a red suit with a pitchfork. Think again. This Imp heaves balls of fire down your throat and takes several bullets to die. It's time to find a better weapon than a pistol if you're going to face more than one of these mutants.DemonHealth: 140Total in single player (ultra violence) : 389From the manual: Sorta like shaved gorillas, except with big heads and lots of teeth. They don't kill easy. Get too close and they'll rip your sorry head off.SpectreHealth: 140Total in single player (ultra violence) : 114From the manual: Great. Just what you needed.

The game engine was largely developed by John Carmack. 22 of the original 27 levels are included, though modified and simplified, and two new maps are included. Music is only included during the title screen and between-level screens. Two player multiplayer Deathmatch and Co-op modes are available through JagLink.[CR]The code developed for this port served as the basis for future ports including the Sega 32X (which was released before the Jaguar version), the 3DO, GameBoy Advance, and PlayStation.Game Boy Advance[CR]Based on the Jaguar port, the GBA version of Doom was released by David A. Palmer Productions in 2001. Five new multiplayer-only maps were designed for this version.iPhone / iPod Touch[CR]An official iOS port of Doom, titled Classic Doom, was released by id Software in 2009. The port is based on the source port PrBoom which allows for OpenGL rendering.Linux[CR]The Linux port of Doom was created by Dave Taylor of id Software and released in 1994. The source code of this port was made available to the public in 1997 and is the basis for all subsequent source ports.MS-DOS[CR]The original version of doom.Playstation[CR]Doom on the Sony Playstation is more of a re-imagining. It features slight variations of levels from The Ultimate Doom and Doom II: Hell on Earth. This version of the game uses modified versions of the Jaguar maps.There was more of an emphasis on mood and atomsphere compared to the PC version and utilized colored lighting. The game's soundtrack differs from the PC version and many enemy and weapon sounds were also changed to make them more intimidating. These changes made for a more darker and atmospheric tone for the franchise which carried forward into DOOM 3.[CR]Enemies from Doom II were added to levels from the first game for an added challenge. Fans of the game in Doom's active modding community have brought it to the PC using the ZDoom source port to add in the various graphical enhancements unique to this version of Doom.Playstation 3[CR]Released in 2012 in a collection called "Doom Classic Complete" which features The Ultimate Doom, Doom 2, Master Levels for Doom 2. This collection also includes the previously exclusive No Rest for the Living bonus episode from the Xbox 360 release of Doom 2. This port features a stripped down version of idtech 5 for networking and other PSN specific code written during the development of RAGE.Sega 32x[CR]Published by Sega in 1994 this version of the game features 17 levels from episodes 1 and 2 but none from episode 3. The port was criticized for not running in full screen and not including the BFG-9000 weapon although it can be acquired using cheat codes. Just like the Super Nintendo version only the front facing sprites for monsters were included thus eliminating the possibility of monster infighting.[CR]When the player finishes level 15 while using cheat codes they are presented with a standard DOS prompt which will remain on screen until the console's reset button is pressed. Only when the player has progressed to level 16 without using cheat codes the gameplay will continue properly. The manual states that the player will start again at level 1 with cheat codes disabled after this point but it does not.Sega Saturn[CR]The Saturn version is very similar to the Playstation version but does not include the colored lighting. The low frame rate compared to the Playstation version has this version lacking Doom's trademark fast-paced gameplay. It was said to include link support for Deathmatch and Cooperative multiplayer but was only included in the European and Japanese releases.SNES[CR]Doom on the Super Nintendo was released in September 1995 by Williams Entertainment is one of the few games to include a Super-FX 2 chip. This version includes 22 levels from the PC version and features the 5 missing levels from the Jaguar version but instead is missing 5 different levels and does not include support for saving your game progress.[CR]Due to hardware limitations monsters can only be viewed from the front making monster infighting impossible, floors and ceilings are not texture mapped and the spectre enemy is not included being replaced by the regular demon instead. Other limitations include not being able to play Episode 2: The Shores of Hell on I'm too young to die (very easy), and hey not too rough (easy), Episode 3: Inferno can only be played on the ultra violence (very hard) and nightmare (hardest) difficulties. Nightmare difficulty was changed to not have respawning monsters although they are still fast like in the PC version. The shotgun does not spread out but instead fires a single projectile equal to a hit from all particles in the PC version.[CR]Automap support utilizes Mode 7 scaling and rotation to allow the map to rotate around the player instead of the player's icon rotating inside of the automap itself a feature unique to this version of the game.[CR]The 2 boss demons, the spider mastermind and the cyberdemon are included in this version of the game which were missing from other ports of that era. Multiplayer support was included for gamers with X-BAND modems.WindowsBill Gates at a Microsoft event in 1995[CR]Known as WinDoom or Doom95, developed for Windows, unveiled in 1995 and released in 1996, this port capitalized on the popularity of Doom and was used by Microsoft to showcase their new DirectX technology. It supports screen resolutions up to 640x480 and features a GUI launcher allowing easy selection of episode, map, difficulty, custom wads, and multiplayer settings.Xbox[CR]This version of Doom was included on the disc with the collectors edition of Doom 3 along with Doom II. This version includes an exclusive secret map in episode 1.Xbox 360[CR]Released in 2006, this port was developed by Nerve Software and was made available for download in the Xbox Live Arcade. Single player contains all four episodes and supports multiplayer (splitscreen or online via Xbox Live) Deathmatch and Co-op with up to four players. The Xbox version includes achievements and leaderboards.[CR]Source Code Release[CR]Also see: Source Port[CR]On December 23 1997, Doom's source code was made available to the public. This has now spawned many new 'Doom' engines, such as Boom, ZDoom, GZDoom (OpenGL), and Legacy, these engines and many like them have been developed to 'update' id Software's original engine and most now support all modern windows platforms, run in high resolutions, have optimized online code, free-look (up/down), jumping &amp; crouching, a console, and cross-hairs.[CR]These engines require the original DOOM.wad or IWADs to run, and are of course able to play modifications of these files such as NeoDoom.[CR]Unofficial Source Ports[CR]These ports were done after the release of idtech 1's Source Code in 1997. Some of these ports may require additional hardware or software to function.Amiga[CR]Doom was ported to the Amiga sometime in 1998 after the release of the source code.Android[CR]There are a variety of ports available on the google play store which can be converted into the full version with the WAD files from the PC version.Sega Dreamcast[CR]The Sega Dreamcast has several source ports available. DoomDC, last updated in 2002 this source port was the first to be released. This version requires the Dreamcast Keyboard to use some functions such as switching weapons.[CR]Another source port is nxDoom which is based on DoomDC. nxDoom runs faster than DoomDC and supports saving, user WADs, .MOD music files, and has all of the games actions mapped to the controller.GP2x[CR]PrBoom and ZDoom were ported to this platform.Nintendo DS[CR]DSDoom is a port of Doom for the Nintendo DS. This version displays the game on the top screen while displaying the UI as well as automap or console output on the bottom screen. This version supports network play with any prBoom server. Music and custom control layouts are not supported.Nintendo Wii[CR]WiiDoom is a port of PrBoom. Doom, Doom 2, Ultimate Doom and Final Doom are supported. The only available control scheme utilizes the Wii Remote and Nunchuck attachment.Sony Playstation 3[CR]PrBoom was ported to this platform. This was the only way to play Doom on the Playstation 3 before the release of Doom Classic Complete.Sony Playstation Portable[CR]The original Doom source code as well as Doom Legacy have been ported to this platform.Tapwave Zodiac[CR]ZdoomZ, a PalmOS port of Linux Doom, runs on the Tapwave Zodiac.Microsoft Xbox[CR]DoomX is a port of the original source code to the Microsoft Xbox. System Link is supported unlike the port included with Doom 3 Collectors Edition.Microsoft Zune HD[CR]Doom for the Zune HD was ported in 2010. Movement is controlled by either tilt or touch controls along with touch buttons for other game actions.[CR]Esoteric Source Ports[CR]Kodak DigitaOS Digital Cameras[CR]A dedicated Doom handheld was created using this port as a hackaday project.Doom 3 Terminals[CR]Perhaps the strangest of them all this port requires a copy of the original release of Doom 3 and a PWAD. Once installed the mod includes a test map with a terminal which runs the original doom. Try it out.Garry's Mod[CR]GMDoom is a partial source port of Doom to Garry's Mod. Weapons, enemies and their behavior can be added in while playing. The mod was released in march 2013 on Steam Workshop.iPod[CR]This source port requires the RockBox alternative firmware. Due to the iPod's media-centric button layout harder difficulties such as ultra violence and nightmare may prove more difficult to play in this versions of the game. Installation instructions can be found here.TI-Nspire Calculators[CR]nDoom supports all retail wads for Doom, Doom 2, Ultimate Doom, and Final Doom.[CR]System Requirements[CR]Minimum System Requirements386sx IBM compatible computerMS-DOS v3.3 or higherVGA (320x200x256) graphics4mb RAMHard Drive - 4.8 MB (Shareware), 12 MB (Mail-order)[CR]Original Release Versions[CR]Shareware VersionIncludes one of the three episodesIncludes network and modem supportMail-order VersionAll shareware featuresIncludes all three episodes (three episodes each with eight levels and a secret level)Includes Plasma rifleIncludes BFG 9000Versionsv0.2 - February 4, 1993 (alpha version)v0.4 - April 2, 1993 (alpha version)v0.5 - May 22, 1993 (alpha version)v1.0 - December 10, 1993 (uses v0.99 engine)v1.1 - December 16, 1993v1.2 - February 17, 1994 (introduced modem support and Nightmare mode)v1.3 - undocumented / never releasedv1.4 - June 1994 (Internet Beta version)v1.5 - July 8, 1994 (Internet Beta version)v1.6 - August 1994 (Internet Beta version)v1.666 - September 1994v1.7 - October 11, 1994v1.7a - November 8, 1994v1.8 - January 23, 1995v1.9 - February 1, 1995 (the final version)[CR]Ultimate Doom, released April 1995, used a slightly modified version of the engine however the version number was not updated.[CR]On December 23 1997 the Doom source code was released, this code has the version number 1.10[CR]Referencing this new version, source port authors (e.g., ZDoom) often began their versions with 1.11[CR]On October 4, 1993 an early beta version of the game was made available to journalists. While this version of the game is similar to the final version (unlike the earlier alpha versions) their are still several key differences most notably the BFG9000 which fired 40 quick bursts of plasma gun ammo. This was changed due to the large number of sprites on screen causing the PC to slowdown. Also, this version has a scoring system. The player could gain score by killing enemies and collecting score giving items such as the Demonic Dagger. The scoring system and scoring items did not make it into the final version of the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hidden Credits[CR]After you see the title screen (says DOOM and has the marine with the shotgun), reset the game and wait to see the title screen again. Repeat this two more times. After the third reset you will see a special credits screen. After that, if you reset it four more times another credits screen. Then after, every fourth reset will show the credits screens (in the same order).</plot>

				<title_clean>Doomsday Warrior</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Doomsday Warrior is a one-on-one fighting game with single-player and two-player modes. In the single-player, the player's character must fight the other six members of the Doom Squad - a group of powerful, brainwashed warriors unwillingly serving an evil god. The player character has come to his senses and defected to the side of good and wishes to save the world from his erstwhile teammates and their leader. The game is presented in such a way that the player can select any of the six warriors to fight in any order before moving onto the bosses after defeating all six.[CR]The game was part of a wave of fighter games to be released in the wake of Street Fighter II. It is known as Taiketsu!! Brass Numbers ("Confrontation!! Brass Numbers") in Japan.CharactersSledge "The Hero of Earth" - The canonical hero, Sledge is a blond human warrior in a red and white outfit that resembles a Super Saiyan Goku of Dragon Ball Z. He's an all-rounder, with average speed and strength, though he's effective at a range. While he appears to fight like Ryu, his moves require holding the opposite direction for a few seconds like Guile or Zangief. (In fact, every fighter's specials work this way.)Layban "Military Deserter" - Another human warrior, but with dark hair and a purple outfit. Layban fights much like Sledge, but with an emphasis on kicks instead of punches. He could be considered the Ken of Doomsday Warrior.Amon "Heavy Metal King" - Amon is a hulking armored warrior in KISS make-up. His wrestling moves emphasize his immense strength, but he is fairly slow as a downside. He's the Zangief of the game.Daisy "Dancing Plant" - Daisy is a very quick fighter who is best attacking with her legs. In that sense, and the fact that she's the only woman, she is the game's Chun Li.P. Lump "Fat Bomber" - Another heavy-set character, P. Lump wears traditional Chinese garb and fights with Kung Fu and unorthodox moves like a head butt. He is the game's E. Honda.Grimrock "Dizzen Lizard" - Grimrock is a quick lizardman fighter who attacks with his claws and tail, making him dangerous and unpredictable. He is essentially the game's Blanka. He has no relation to the game of the same name.Nuform "Living Liquid" - Another unpredictable character, Nuform is a shapeshifter creature with attacks that range from fireballs to sliding kicks. It is the game's Dhalsim equivalent. It resembles Virtua Fighter's Dural or the Supervisor of Rise of the Robots (as well as the T-1000 of Terminator 2: Judgement Day, on whom the previous two characters are also based on).[CR]As well as the playable characters above, the game also features three special boss characters. These characters are unplayable without cheat codes:Shadow "Left Hand of Evil" - Shadow fights exactly like whoever their opponent is. In this sense, it is the "mirror match" that is often a staple of early fighter games.Ashura "Right Hand of Evil" - Ashura is a powerful fighter with six arms that will very quickly defeat any fighter that comes close to him. Like many fighter game bosses, the player's best bet is to use hit and run tactics.Main "Magical Lord" - The final boss of the game, Main has a plethora of ranged attacks to use against the player, so keeping away with the occasional quick assault isn't quite as effective a plan.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] View every characters ending[CR]This is a very wierd trick I doubt anyone else has discovered.  If you have a Super Scope, plug it into the second controller port, put the game in and turn the system on.  You will see a number.  You can use the D pad to make the number go higher or lower.  Press a button after you select the number and you one of the endings of the fighters in the game will play.</plot>

				<title_clean>Double Dragon V - The Shadow Falls</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Double Dragon V is based on a cartoon series.[CR]Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls was the fifth game to be released in the Double Dragon franchise. No longer property of Technos Japan Corporation, Double Dragon V is very different from previous games in the franchise. Double Dragon V was released on August 5, 1994 in North America (for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis) and April 5, 1995 for the Atari Jaguar (by Telegames). Developed by Leland Interactive Media and published by Tradewest, Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls is a 2D fighting game based on the Double Dragon cartoon series, rather than being a side-scrolling beat-em-up like its predecessors.[CR]The game's plot loosely follows the Double Dragon cartoon series that was also produced by Tradewest. In the game, the Shadow Master creates a virus known as the Shadow Plague. In order to prevent the Shadow Master from unleashing the virus into Metro City, Billy Lee and Jimmy Lee must fight a variety of characters in one-on-one tournament battles.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Billy Lee vs. Sickle[CR]Capitalizing on the incredible popularity of the tournament fighting genre in the 1990s (originating from Street Fighter II), Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls is similar to many other fighting games from that time period. Players can use weak, medium, or strong punches and kicks to dispatch their opponents, utilizing a six-button layout similar to Street Fighter II. The Genesis version allows for a three-button layout, where allowing players to press the start button to switch between kicking and punching.[CR]Special moves are activated by holding down one direction, and then quickly shifting directions and hitting a certain button (e.g. holding left for two seconds, quickly pressing down and punch simultaneously will unleash a special attack from Jimmy Lee). This combination of button inputs was criticized by fans and critics who found it strange to have to quickly switch directions without sliding the control pad.The Quest Mode takes players through a story.[CR]There are several modes available in Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls. Tournament Mode is the default single player fighting mode, in which the player can fight through every character in the game in a random order. The multiplayer mode, VS. Mode, is a traditional two-player arena fighting mode, allowing players to choose whichever character they want. There is a second single player mode, Quest Mode, which adds a story, but is essentially the same as Tournament Mode. Quest Mode has two stories available; the Lee brothers fighting the Shadow Master, or one of the Shadow Warriors fighting to become his apprentice. Additionally, there is a mode that allows players to choose two computer controlled characters, and watch them fight each other.[CR]Another feature of Double Dragon V are Overkills, which are finishing moves that give a different losing animation for the defeated character. Each character has a special animation, triggered when they are killed with a specific attack. For example, the Lee brothers' Overkill is a flash of light, leaving the Lee brothers as a skeleton, with only their sword remaining.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Billy LeeBilly Lee[CR]Born on October 23, 1969, Billy Lee likes milk and doesn't like the Shadow Master. He is one of the two Lee brothers fighting against the threat of the Shadow Plague, a virus that the Shadow Master has threatened to unleash on the city. His Overkill involves a flash of light, ending with him as a skeleton with only his sword remaining. He was raised by the Oldest Dragon, and left to find his brother after learning the art of fighting.Jimmy Lee[CR]Also born on October 23, 1969, Jimmy Lee like video games and doesn't like bad hair days. The second of the Le twins, Jimmy Lee is the fair-haired brother. His Overkill is the same as his brother's; he transforms into a skeleton after a flash of light. Jimmy was raised by the Shadow Master, who deceived him into believing that the Shadow Master was his father. When he realizes the truth, he joins his brother Billy to become one of the Double Dragons.JawbreakerJawbreaker[CR]Born on March 23, 1963, Jawbreaker likes food, but doesn't like flossing. Originally from Des Moines, Jawbreaker practices the art of Che-Zit-Tsu. In Jawbreaker's Overkill, he falls to the ground after all of the teeth in his mouth fall out. Naturally, he loves eating, and thus his moves center around this.Icepick[CR]Born on February 20, 1965, Icepick likes Eskimo pies, but doesn't like the greenhouse effect. From Nome, Alaska, Icepick is well-trained in the fighting style of Icekido. In his Overkill, he is chopped in half and then collapses into a pile of ice. Icepick is the most intelligent member of the Shadow Warriors, as well as the team's computer expert.BonesBones[CR]Literally a skeleton, Bones is as old as dust.

He is one of the four characters created specifically for Double Dragon V.Trigger Happy[CR]Born on April 21, 1959, Trigger Happy likes crew cuts, but dislikes ballet. His fighting style, lock and load, mostly involves the usage of a large cannon on his right hand. In his Overkill, the aforementioned cannon explodes, killing Trigger Happy.CountdownCountdown[CR]A cyborg, Countdown's date of birth is listed as Cyborg Type 0041 Alpha. He like New Year's Eve, but dislikes DMV eye tests. Originally from New Orleans, his fighting style is the ancient art of dissin'.

With her Wolverine-like claws, she is adept in the art of Re-Boot-Tsu. In her Overkill, she begins to glow until she disappears completely, leaving only her clothes behind. As a child, she kept getting biotic implants, such as armor plated skin and claws. She is one of the four characters created specifically for Double Dragon V.DominiqueThe Shadow Master[CR]A dangerous woman, Dominique's birthdate is unknown. In her Overkill, she transforms into a pile of maggots. Dominique uses a variety of whip, knife, and high heel based attacks. Dominique is one of four characters created especially for Double Dragon V, as well as one of two secret unlockable characters.Shadow Master[CR]The mortal enemy of the Double Dragons and the leader of the Shadow Warriors, the Shadow Master was born centuries ago. His goal is to take over the entire world, something which he attempts in Double Dragon V. He has a variety of abilities, such as teleportation, shape-shifting, and two powerful weapons (a scythe and a sword).

				<title_clean>Dragon's Lair</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dirk the Daring's fluid animation and unparalleled visual detail helped make Dragon's Lair a hit.[CR]Dragon's Lair was first released as a Laserdisc arcade game in 1983 by Cinematronics, featuring artwork created by former Disney animator Don Bluth. Because of the relatively large storage capacity of the laserdisc, Cinematronics were able to create a game that featured higher fidelity graphics than other contemporary games. It was also a highly influential title of its time, opening the floodgates to several other laserdisc titles, such as Space Ace, Bega's Battle, and Cliff Hanger.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair puts players in the greaves of Dirk the Daring, a knight trying to rescue the Princess Daphne. Daphne has been kidnapped by Singe the Dragon, and is now being held in the castle. Dirk's adventure will have him battling monsters and the castle alike as he attempts to save the day.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dragon's Lair played like an animated Choose Your Own Adventure book.[CR]The gameplay of Dragon's Lair varies wildly from version to version, a common misconception is that the "Quick Time Event" game is the only version of Dragon's Lair in existence, however on platforms like the NES and SNES, Dragon's Lair is a 2D platformer requiring players to navigate multi-tiered stages, finding one of multiple exits to complete a level and progress through the castle to the final boss fight. The QTE-focused game only appears on certain platforms, in this variation of the game players watch and sometimes control Dirk through his adventures though Singe's castle. At very specific intervals during the game, Dirk will be in a situation that will force the player to control him, choosing which to direction to move him in around or having him attack enemies. Each of these sequences would trigger a new scene in the movie to start playing, similar to the way a DVD can have different "chapters" to select at any time. Choosing the right action in these confrontations would cause Dirk to circumnavigate his obstacle with aplomb, while choosing the wrong action would trigger a sequence in which Dirk is killed. The player is helped out by some degree of input clues such as flashing lights letting them know the direction to push. Added help to these sequences was added in the iPhone version which by default causes the on screen controls to flash the correct input, although this feature can be turned of if desired. The limited, simple button pressing gameplay set to cinematic action that would later evolve into the Quick Time Event, featured in games like Shenmue, Resident Evil 4, and Heavy Rain.[CR]In the original arcade version, the castle's rooms were presented in a semi-randomized order. The player would advance to a new room regardless of whether they could complete the previous one, however before the final confrontation with the dragon, the player would be required to replay the scenes they failed. In addition many of the rooms played "in reverse" (meaning, a jump to the left became a jump to the right the second time a scene played) meaning that even if one were to memorize every room in the castle they would still have to keep a keen eye on the layout of each room. The high score table was usually part of a separate cabinet extension.[CR]An experienced player who memorized every input for every scene could complete the game in less than 10 minutes. These experienced players soon realized that the player's score was increased with every successful input, regardless if the scene ended in success or failure. Thus, the score could be inflated by purposely dying before the last move of a long scene, and saving the last "life" for the final scene with the dragon. As new lives were rewarded throughout the game, these players could extend their play time to 20 minutes or more on one credit.[CR]Development[CR]Dragon&#8217;s Lair was the brain child of Rick Dyer, president of Advanced Microcomputer Systems, who, supposedly, realized that video games needed top quality animation during a viewing of the animated film The Secret of NIMH. He also claims that the Atari 2600 classic &#8220;Adventure&#8221; was another inspiration for Dragon&#8217;s Lair. The entire game was animated by Disney Animator Don Bluth at his personal studio. The game was made in less than 7 months for a mere one million dollars (cheap considering the work they were doing with new technology). The animators on the game couldn&#8217;t afford to hire real models to provide an appropriate frame for the Princess Daphne, so Cinematronic&#8217;s team apparently used Playboy magazines as an inspiration.[CR]Xbox Live Arcade Port[CR]On March 19th, 2012 it was announced that Dragon's Lair was coming to Xbox Live Arcade. The port is developed by Digital Leisure and published by Microsoft Studios. The Xbox Live Arcade port includes support for the standard controller, as well as Kinect.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Drakkhen is an RPG released in 1989 for the Atari ST and Amiga. It was originally published by Infogrames, a French company that eventually became Atari SA. It was eventually ported to the MS-DOS with several additions, and then to the Super Nintendo by Kemco in 1991.[CR]The game had a few novel features for the time, including an open 3D overworld (actually just an effect created by vectors and sprite-scaling, similar to the SNES's Mode 7) and a real-time day/night cycle. It received a SNES-only sequel Dragon View, known in Japan as Super Drakkhen. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The prophecy has been fulfilled. The world shall be ruled by the dragons. On an island far away, their lords prepare for the conquest of the lands. There is only one hope for mankind. The emperor sends out four heroes -- warriors and magicians -- to solve the puzzle of tears and prevent the invasion of the Drakkhen.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player needs to explore the environment with their group of adventurers, visiting various castles to solve the quest that been given to them. The player can also choose to wander off the path and explore the countryside, though various dangers await to quickly slay an under-leveled party.[CR]Combat is done automatically whenever the party encounters an enemy. The adventurers wander into the first-person view and fight the creatures they've encountered until either side is defeated or the player decides to flee. Characters switch to this third-person view inside locations as well.[CR]Among the many regular monsters the group can encounter, there are also dragons that can be found by wandering too far away as well as several "special" monsters that can be fought when certain conditions are met such as a colossal panther head that strikes if the group interferes with any graves in any way, powerful beings that descend from space should the party look up at specific constellations, and the chilling "Shadow Man" - a fully black humanoid figure who emerges from the ground to an ominous tune. These creatures are almost certain death, especially to low-level parties, and will often eradicate confused newbies who decide to explore their surroundings.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>A mystical television has challenged 2 kids to complete quests on various worlds. The first world is the Medieval World, land of castles, dungeons, undead skeleton warriors, malicious knights, and lots of keys and doors. The goal is to collect a number of puzzle pieces and get out of the world. Other world themes include Egyptian, Prehistoric, and Futuristic.[CR]Dream TV is a 2-player action/adventure game with only a single player. The player must alternately control both kids throughout the game. The player can either adopt a split-screen view showing both kids, or a fullscreen view that focuses on one kid. The game includes challenges that require the player to use both kids simultaneously, such as a see-saw where both kids need to bounce on either end in order to propel one up onto a higher platform.</plot>

				<title_clean>Dungeon Master</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dungeon Master is a first person dungeon adventure from developer FTL (Faster than Light). The quest is to descend through 14 levels of the eponymous Dungeon to retrieve the Fire Staff - the only weapon capable of stopping the evil Lord Chaos.[CR]Dungeon Master was originally released on the Atari ST home computer in 1987. It was later ported to various other home computers of the era, such as the Amiga, the PC, the FM Towns, the Sharp X68000 and the Apple-II. It would eventually see console ports on the Super Nintendo and TurboGrafx-CD as well. Dungeon Master was eventually followed up with a far more challenging expansion pack, Chaos Strikes Back, as well as a sequel in 1994: Dungeon Master II: The Legend of Skullkeep.[CR]Dungeon Master was a trailblazing RPG in that it created the first truly real-time dungeon crawler. Previous games of the genre, such as Wizardry and Ultima, focused on long turn-based battles and thus were a little too ponderous for many. Dungeon Master's many boons to accessibility made it a huge hit.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The quest begins in the Hall of Champions. Portraits of fallen warriors line the hallways and as the player views these they are able to resurrect them to join the party. Champions must be selected carefully to complement each other as each have different skills and equipment that will be needed on the journey.[CR]The game featured a sophisticated experience system for the time in which it was made. Each character is able to progress in four classes: Fighter, Ninja, Priest and Wizard. Advancement in each is dependent on using the skills relevant to the profession. For example, a character put at the front of the party that attacks enemies with melee weapons will advance in the fighter class. Ninja classes are raised by throwing items, Priest classes are raised by creating potions through magic and Wizard classes are raised by casting offensive spells. At any point the player can simply choose to spam an activity over and over to raise their levels, as with each level raised in any class came additional health, mana and other stats. This helped mitigate the game's occasional difficulty spikes, such as the tough worm monsters on the fourth floor.[CR]As well as the experience system Dungeon Master gave each character a number of additional attributes that needed to be carefully managed throughout the quest. Characters would need food, drink and rest. Food can be occasionally found after defeating monsters, water supplies can be replenished in the occasional fountain and it is important to remember that sleeping wherever enemies were close is always a mistake.[CR]The magic system in Dungeon Master includes various recipes for spells and potions, which requires casting the correct magical runes in order. If combined correctly a spell would result. If not, nothing would occur, but the player would still lose mana from the attempt. Basic spells are provided via scrolls but many are left to the player's experimentation, with knowledge of what each individual rune symbolizes as clues.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bad Ending[CR]Once you get the Firestaff in level 6, go back to the beginning of the game and Lord Order will appear and kill you after saying you didn't discover the true secret of the Firestaff.</plot>

				<title_clean>E.V.O. - Search for Eden</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]EVO: Search for Eden takes place at the dawn of life on the planet Earth. The player is one of many different creatures created by Gaia, the daughter of Sol the Sun, as they try to survive in a hostile, competitive world. As the story progresses, it transpires that the natural course of evolution on this planet is being toyed with by an unknown force. This force has begun to alter creatures using crystals to make them stronger and more likely to dominate the emerging web of flora and fauna. While struggling to survive and evolve the player will come to understand that in order to earn their place by Gaia&#8217;s side they must solve the mystery of who is interfering with the evolution of this planets lifeforms.[CR]The game is a fusion of side-scrolling and RPG gameplay elements. The player defeats enemies by biting, stomping, and eating them to collect EVO points which serve to fuel the character development and evolution.[CR]Ages[CR]Each chapter in the game proceeds to a different "age," each corresponding with a major change in the morphology of the player-character. They proceeded as follows, with the dominant "species" of the character in parentheses:Chapter 1: The World Before Land (Fish)[CR]In this stage, the player assumes the body of an aquatic creature and fights in order to earn the right to leave the water.Chapter 2: Early Creatures of Land (Amphibian)[CR]The player's creature evolves once more, growing legs and becoming an amphibious lifeform exploring dry land for the first time.Chapter 3: Age of Dinosaurs (Dinosaur)[CR]In this stage the player will be able to evolve into a dinosaur. There is also a chance to evolve into a bird if the player choose to jump off a cliff from the top of Mount Brave.Chapter 4: Ice Age (Mammal)[CR]The player is able to unlock a Human body in this era if a cat jaw and a rabbit body already have been evolved. The Ramophitecus body must also be evolved at least 2 to 3 times in order to become Human.Chapter 5: Early Man (mammal continued, eventually human)[CR]The player is stuck in whatever form they chose to evolve into.[CR]The final clue to the mystery of the strange crystals is found in this chapter.[CR]Each age contains an overworld map with several stages to be played. Previously finished levels can be revisited in order to gain more EVO points, as well as occasionally backtracking allowing for extra exposition in the story.[CR]Evolution[CR]Evolution proceeds in two different ways over the course of the game. At the beginning of each age, the player's creature changes drastically to a new form, becoming rather weak. Over the process of each age, defeated enemies drop "meat" which can be eaten to regain health and gain EVO points. These EVO points can be spent to upgrade various parts of the body, with each part having several options to choose from. Each potential evolution has a required amount of EVO points to purchase, and is gained immediately when points are spent.[CR]Body parts that can be evolved include:JawsHornsNeckBodyHands and FeetDorsal FinTailBack of the Head[CR]Upgrades to each of these body parts give a variety of changes to the abilities of the player, from attack damage to health and defense. Each time that a large, story-related evolution is reached, however, all minor evolutions are lost and new ones must be purchased. The evolutions do not follow any set order, allowing the player to upgrade any part of the body to deal with an immediate threat or obstacle.Sales and critical reception[CR]The game was not released to much fanfare, but has generally been recognized as a work of high quality and became something a cult favorite years later.[CR]Its fusion of side-scrolling and RPG gameplay was too repetitive for some, as players who enjoy the side-scrolling genre may not have been interested in the amount of character development normally associated with an RPG. Those willing to endure the occasional grind, however, appreciate the game's unique subject matter and use of evolution as a gamplay device.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Earth Defense Force</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Earth Defense Force is a side-scrolling shooter that was originally released into the arcades. A version was later ported to the Super Nintendo that lacked two player co-op play but had new weapons. The game was developed and published by Jaleco. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The universe has been at peace for the last two thousand years due to the creation of the Union of Federated Planets, which was formed to promote harmony and understanding between all the different races. But recently a mysterious organization known as AGYMA has been plotting to gain power and cause chaos. AGYMA has been provoking nearby planets that used to have feuds until the formation of the Union of Federated Planets, now these once peaceful planets are attacking each other again. If left unchecked, AGYMA could wreak havoc and destroy the now peaceful universe. [CR]However, the Galactic Intelligence Force has infiltrated the AGYMA and learned of their next move. AGYMA plans to annihilate Earth, home to the Union Council, and they've already set up home bases on Earth and the Moon. Of course, for every villain there is a hero and luckily the Earth Defense Force (E.D.F.) is here to save the day.[CR]The player is a member of the E.D.F. and has volunteered to take down AGYMA singlehandedly. Piloting the latest the E.D.F. has to offer, the XA-1, the player will be in command of eight different weapons and two small satellite ships. The task at hand is difficult though; the player will have to pilot their way to their bases and destroy six separate bosses, all on their own. [CR]An interesting note: the back of the US box provides the quote "A super saga of 23rd century satellite warfare!" while the US manual states the game takes place in the year 4129. Conflicting dates indeed.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]There are six stages in the game, each with a boss fight at the end and even some with a mini boss. The player starts out with four ships with each ship being able to sustain three hits, lose all ships and it's game over. Before each stage there's an opportunity to chose from one of the eight available weapons (see below), as well as upon death or after completing a stage. While shooting down enemies the bar at the top of the screen increases - that's XA-1 gaining experience. From level one to five, the ship will become stronger with each enemy killed. The satellites will level up as well, more on that later. It's also possible to change the ship's speed at will.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Stage 1: First Encounter[CR]The first encounter with the AGYMA is a daylight mission over Earth. Fight a mini boss before making it the level boss as well as hundreds of individual enemies just as capable of taking the XA-1 down.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]EarthBound is a role-playing game originally published by Nintendo for the Japanese Super Famicom in 1994 and localized in 1995 for North America's Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Written, directed and produced by notable Japanese author Shigesato Itoi, Earthbound is actually the second game in Itoi's Mother franchise and is known as Mother 2 in Japan. It is also the only entry in the series to see an official international release. The game was considered unique among its contemporaries due to its unusual setting: a quirky modern world that stood in stark contrast to the medieval fantasy and futuristic science-fiction environments common in other RPGs. The series eventually saw another entry in 2006, released only on the Game Boy Advance in Japan as Mother 3; Earthbound itself was re-released in a Japanese GBA compilation called Mother 1+2 to promote the third game's release.[CR]EarthBound was also re-released for the Wii U Virtual Console on July 18, 2013 in North America and Europe. This was the first re-release of the game in North America and the first official release of the game anywhere in Europe. A digital version of the strategy guide originally packed with the North American SNES release was also made available on the Nintendo of America website. In Japan, Mother 2 was made available for Wii U Virtual Console on March 20, 2013 for thirty yen as part of a Famicom 30th Anniversary promotion.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]EarthBound's turn-based combat[CR]EarthBound's gameplay is largely similar to earlier entries in Square Enix's popular Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy role-playing franchises. Players navigate their party from an overhead perspective through an expansive game world, conversing with NPCs, acquiring items and fighting enemies in turn-based battles. However, unlike nearly all other RPGs of its vintage, there are no random encounters; instead, combat is initiated when any member of the player's party touches an enemy in the field. Battles may also begin with a surprise attack from the enemy or a free turn for the player's party, depending on which directions the party and the enemy are facing when combat is initiated. As the party increases their levels, weaker enemies will begin to run away; encountering enemies that are significantly weaker than the party may even result in an instant victory, bypassing combat entirely.[CR]Much like preceding Dragon Quest titles, EarthBound's combat system takes places from a first-person perspective. Both the player's party and the enemy act in turns using physical attacks, PSI abilities or inventory items. Party stats and equipment also play a critical role during battles and heavily influence each character's viability in combat. Stats can be increased by earning experience points from defeated enemies, eventually causing characters to level-up and gain additional predetermined stat points. Ness and his friends wield a variety of relatively mundane weapons throughout the game including baseball bats and yo-yos, and they can equip themselves with protective gear that sometimes grants additional benefits.[CR]Each character also has a certain number of hit points reflecting their overall health. When a character takes damage, their hit points are gradually decremented on a rolling counter. Once a character's HP reaches zero, the character falls unconscious, preventing them from acting in battle until they are revived either by certain restorative items or by paying a doctor's fee at a Hospital. Hit points were well-established as a mechanic to reflect player health in RPGs by the time of EarthBound's release; however, the rolling HP counter used in EarthBound allows players to continue issuing commands to mortally-wounded characters until their counter actually "ticks down" to zero. This uniquely-implemented HP mechanic presents an additional layer of strategy in combat, giving players the opportunity to save their party members from KO status by either healing immediately or defeating all enemies quickly to end the battle.[CR]Inventory space in EarthBound is limited; each player character receives fourteen inventory slots which are divided not only between consumable items, but also any equipped gear carried by the character. With the addition of certain mandatory key items received by Ness early in the story which also occupy precious inventory space, EarthBound's inventory system is notably restrictive when compared to those of other RPGs. These restrictions are somewhat mitigated by Escargot Express, a parcel service managed through Ness' younger sister Tracy that can store several items outside of the party's inventory.PSI Abilities[CR]Ness, Paula and Poo also possess psychic abilities called PSI that can be used inside and outside of battle. These abilities are regulated by a character's PP, or Psychic Points. When a player's PP is drained, their PSI abilities can no longer be used. PP is restored by resting or consuming certain PP-recovering items. Characters will sometimes gain brand-new or improved PSI abilities while leveling up. Jeff does not use PSI, instead relying on his inventions for applying status effects and firing bottle rockets to deal large amounts of damage.[CR]Listed below are the available PSI abilities and their effects:Recovery PSIPSI AbilityLearned By (Lv.)PPEffectLifeup &#945;Ness (2), Poo (15)5Restores 75-125 HP to a single allyLifeup &#946;Ness (20), Poo (15)8Restores 225-375 HP to a single allyLifeup &#947;Ness (39), Poo (46)13Restores all HP to a single allyLifeup &#937;Ness (70)24Restores 300-500 HP to all alliesHealing &#945;Ness (10), Poo (15)5Heals cold, sunstroke &amp; sleepHealing &#946;Ness (24), Poo (15)8&#945; + poison, nausea, crying &amp; strangeHealing &#947;Ness (53), Poo (36)20&#946; + paralysis, diamond &amp; death (75%)Healing &#937;Poo (52)38&#947; + death (100% success)PSI Magnet &#945;Paula (15), Poo (21)0Absorbs 2-8 PP from a single enemyPSI Magnet &#937;Paula (21), Poo (27)0Absorbs 2-8 PP from all enemiesOffensive PSIPSI AbilityLearned By (Lv.)PPEffectPSI Rockin' &#945;Ness (8)1040-120 damage to all enemiesPSI Rockin' &#946;Ness (22)1490-270 damage to all enemiesPSI Rockin' &#947;Ness (49)40160-480 damage to all enemiesPSI Rockin' &#937;Ness (75)98320-960 damage to all enemiesPSI Flash &#945;Ness (18)8Random crying/strange (all enemies)PSI Flash &#946;Ness (38)19&#945; + numbness/deathPSI Flash &#947;Ness (61)24&#945; + numbness/death (better chance)PSI Flash &#937;Ness (67)32&#945; + numbness/death (best chance)PSI Fire &#945;Paula (3)660-100 damage to one rowPSI Fire &#946;Paula (19)12120-200 damage to one rowPSI Fire &#947;Paula (37)20180-300 damage to one rowPSI Fire &#937;Paula (64)42240-400 damage to one rowPSI Freeze &#945;Paula (1), Poo (15)4135-255 damage to one enemyPSI Freeze &#946;Paula (11), Poo (15)9270-450 damage to one enemyPSI Freeze &#947;Paula (31), Poo (33)18405-675 damage to one enemyPSI Freeze &#937;Paula (46)28540-900 damage to one enemyPSI Starstorm &#945;Poo (event)24270-450 damage to all enemiesPSI Starstorm &#937;Poo (event)42540-900 damage to all enemiesPSI Thunder &#945;Paula (8), Poo (15)360-180 damage to one enemyPSI Thunder &#946;Paula (25), Poo (15)760-180 damage to one enemy (x2)PSI Thunder &#947;Paula (57), Poo (41)16100-300 damage to one enemy (x3)PSI Thunder &#937;Poo (55)20100-300 damage to one enemy (x4)Assist PSIPSI AbilityLearned By (Lv.)PPEffectHypnosis &#945;Ness (4)6Puts one enemy to sleepHypnosis &#937;Ness (27)18Puts all enemies to sleepShield &#945;Ness (12), Poo (15)6Shields one allyShield &#931;Poo (15)18Shields all alliesShield &#946;Ness (34), Poo (16)10Power shields one allyShield &#937;Poo (51)30Power shields all alliesPSI Shield &#945;Paula (6)8Psychic shields one allyPSI Shield &#931;Paula (26)24Psychic shields all alliesPSI Shield &#946;Paula (51)14Psychic power shields one allyPSI Shield &#937;Paula (60)42Psychic power shields all alliesBrainshock &#945;Poo (24)10Makes one enemy feel strangeBrainshock &#937;Poo (44)30Makes all enemies feel strangeParalysis &#945;Ness (14)8Paralyzes one enemyParalysis &#937;Ness (29)24Paralyzes all enemiesOffense Up &#945;Paula (21)10Raises one ally's offenseOffense Up &#937;Paula (40)30Raises all allies' offenseDefense Down &#945;Paula (29)6Decreases one enemy's defenseDefense Down &#937;Paula (54)18Decreases all enemies' defense[CR]The game's various "Shield" abilities apply different effects when used.

A meteorite crashes into the foothills behind Ness' house late one night, waking Ness and his family. Ness hikes up to the crash site and finds his nosy neighbor Pokey pestering several police officers assigned to investigate the impact crater. After returning home, Ness is woken again later that night by a loud knocking at his front door; Pokey bursts in to explain that his younger brother Picky is missing and coerces Ness to help look for him. Accompanied by his dog King, Ness and Pokey reach the meteorite and find Picky napping nearby; however, as they begin to leave, an insect-like creature named Buzz Buzz emerges from a beam of light.[CR]Buzz Buzz has traveled back in time from ten years in the future to warn Ness about Giygas, an interstellar warlord that has conquered Earth in Buzz Buzz's own time. However, the "Apple of Enlightenment" has predicted that four children are destined to change history by defeating Giygas in the present. Buzz Buzz accompanies Ness back to Pokey's house, but along the way the party is suddenly confronted by a Starman Junior, one of Giygas' agents sent back in time to assassinate Buzz Buzz and his newfound allies. Buzz Buzz demonstrates considerable psychic abilities during their battle and easily defeats this powerful enemy; he also explains that Giygas has already begun to influence the evil that exists inside other living creatures and even inanimate objects, causing them to become hostile towards anyone that stands against Giygas.[CR]Ness safely escorts Pokey and Picky home, but Buzz Buzz is tragically killed by Pokey's mother after being mistaken for a dung beetle. With his last breath, Buzz Buzz entrusts Ness with an artifact called the Sound Stone. Ness must visit eight &#8220;Your Sanctuary&#8221; locations scattered across the world and record their melodies, which will allow Ness and his friends to defeat Giygas.OnettGiant Step, the first "Your Sanctuary"[CR]Ness ventures into town the next morning in search of the first melody at Giant Step, one of Onett's local landmarks. He also learns that the Sharks, Onett's gang of street punks, have recently become much more aggressive. The path leading to Giant Step has been locked by the police under orders from Mayor B. H. Pirkle, who asks Ness to deal with the Sharks in return for the key. Ness fights his way through the Sharks' hangout at the local arcade and confronts their leader, Frank Fly, as well as his homemade tank "Frankystein Mk. II". Frank immediately reforms after his defeat, pledging his support to Ness and promising to keep the Sharks in line.[CR]After retrieving Pirkle's key (and promising not to hold the mayor responsible for any accidents), Ness battles through the cave leading to Giant Step and defeats its guardian Titanic Ant, receiving the first "Your Sanctuary" melody as a reward. However, an irate police officer scolds Ness for trespassing as he leaves the cave and directs him to report to the Police Station. Ness is attacked by a group of crooked cops lead by Captain Strong at the station; after beating them up, Captain Strong radios his officers at the roadblock, instructing them to re-open the road south to Twoson.TwosonBiking around Twoson[CR]Soon after leaving Onett, Ness begins receiving telepathic messages in his dreams from someone named Paula pleading for help. The town of Twoson is also buzzing about Paula's recent kidnapping, eventually leading Ness to lock horns with Mr. Everdred, the crime boss of Burglin Park. Everdred reveals that Paula was taken to a place called Happy Happy Village by followers of a strange blue-worshiping cult led by a man named Carpainter. Ness attempts to head through Peaceful Rest Valley to reach the cult's base, but the path is blocked by a large pencil-shaped object. Returning to Twoson, Ness befriends the unkempt inventor Apple Kid and receives his newest invention, the Pencil Eraser, which removes the obstruction.[CR]After reaching Happy Happy Village, Ness finds the small cabin where Paula is imprisoned. She gives Ness the Franklin Badge for protection against Carpainter, who also holds the key to her cell. Pokey suddenly appears outside the cabin and reveals himself to be Carpainter's lackey before sending more cultists to attack Ness. With the Franklin Badge's lightning-reflecting capabilities, Ness returns to the Happy Happyists' headquarters and soundly beats Carpainter, who claims to have begun acting strangely after acquiring the Mani Mani Statue from Lier X. Agerate. Carpainter's cult immediately dissolves, allowing Ness to easily free Paula from the cabin. Before returning to Twoson, the pair visit nearby Lilliput Steps, the second &#8220;Your Sanctuary&#8221; location, and defeat Mondo Mole to record the location's melody.[CR]Bus service to the next town, Threed, resumes after Ness and Paula return to Twoson; however, the connecting tunnel is filled with ghosts which prevent buses from actually reaching Threed. Their only lead is Everdred, who had asked Ness to return to him after rescuing Paula. When Ness meets Everdred again, he gifts a large wad of bills to the party worth exactly $10,000. Ness and Paula visit Twoson's Chaos Theater, a music venue currently hosting a group called the Runaway Five. One of the band's frontmen gives Ness free tickets to the show and explains that the Runaway Five is trapped in Twoson by a phony contract drawn up by Mr. Poochyfud, the theater manager. Ness hands Everdred's cash to Poochyfud, who excitedly rips up the contract. The grateful Runaway Five members offer Ness and Paula a lift to Threed before continuing onto their next venue in Fourside; the band's loud music prevents ghosts from attacking their tour bus.Threed &amp; WintersZombie Paper's remarkable effects[CR]Zombies run amok in Threed, a gloomy town where even the sun has stopped shining. Ness and Paula question the terrified locals who have retreated into the center of town as a last defense; they mention a secret tunnel in the town's graveyard that seems to be the source of the undead. The party investigates the graveyard and find the passage blocked by a pair of zombie sentries. When they return to town, Ness notices a suspicious woman loitering outside the Threed Sunset Hotel. Following the woman inside leads Ness and Paula straight into an ambush, and they are quickly rendered unconscious by several zombies. The pair awaken in an underground cell, causing Paula to call out telepathically in desperation.[CR]Paula's psychic call reaches across the ocean toward Winters, a snowy country far to the north of Eagleland, and is heard by a young student named Jeff attending Snow Wood Boarding School. Jeff wakes up in the middle of the night and immediately sets out to find Paula; with the assistance of his best friend Tony, Jeff climbs over the school gate and begins his journey south. He also meets the gum-loving Bubble Monkey, who joins Jeff's party. The pair soon reach the northern shore of Lake Tess, the habitat of a mythical creature named Tessie. Strange winds begin to blow, prompting Bubble Monkey to blow a bubble that lifts him towards Tessie's emerging head. Jeff and Bubble Monkey ride Tessie to the southern shore, passing through Brick Road's simple dungeon as well as the famous Stonehenge before Bubble Monkey leaves to pursue an attractive female monkey. Jeff finally reaches the laboratory of his father, Dr. Andonuts, where the two share an awkward reunion after several years. Dr. Andonuts also gives Jeff the Sky Runner, a flying saucer capable of long-distance travel. Jeff bids his father farewell and flies to Threed to rescue Ness and Paula from their cell under the graveyard, accidentally wrecking the Sky Runner in the process.[CR]Ness and his friends continue their search for a way through the graveyard, eventually defeating a strange monster south of Threed known as Boogey Tent. The animated circus tent was guarding a jar of Fly Honey: the favorite food of the zombies' leader, a disgusting entity named Master Belch. Apple Kid also calls Ness to notify him about the delivery of his next invention, an anti-zombie weapon called "Zombie Paper". Ness spreads the sticky paper inside the circus tent in the center of town, trapping all of the zombies inside the tent by the next morning and opening the path through the graveyard.[CR]The party battles through the subterranean passage and emerges near Grapefruit Falls, the location of Master Belch's secret base. Without a password, Ness is denied entry to the base and instead visits nearby Saturn Valley, home of the odd but friendly Mr. Saturns. One Mr. Saturn gives Ness a hint to reach Belch's base: stand still for three minutes. The party returns to the base and easily defeats Belch by distracting him with the Jar of Fly Honey, rescuing several enslaved Mr. Saturns along their way. After resting in Saturn Valley's hot springs, Ness and his friends battle the Trillionage Sprout at Milky Well, the third "Your Sanctuary" location, and receive its melody before trekking back to a much brighter and safer Threed.FoursidePokey is always one step ahead[CR]Heavy gridlock on the highway forces the party's bus to stop in Dusty Dunes Desert. They detour on foot across an expanse of scalding desert sands and eventually reach the metropolis of Fourside, a bustling city controlled by reclusive business tycoon and mayor Geldegarde Monotoli. Pokey has also reappeared in Fourside and now works closely with Monotoli as his business aide. After returning to Dusty Dunes to clear out a mole-infested gold mine, the appreciative mine owners give Ness a large Diamond as a reward. Coincidentally, the Runaway Five have once again been cheated by a crooked manager, this time at Fourside's Topolla Theater, and the band is in debt for one million dollars. Ness' Diamond more than covers their debt and the party is treated to one last performance of the band, who promise to help Ness and his friends someday soon in return for their incredible generosity.[CR]Fourside's multi-story Department Store reopens its doors soon afterward, but Paula is kidnapped during a sudden blackout when the party tries to exit the building. Ness and Jeff reach the top floor and defeat the Department Store Spook, who reveals that Paula is being held by Giygas' minions inside the heavily-guarded Monotoli Building. With no way to bypass Monotoli's security, Ness and Jeff hit the streets of Fourside for leads. Their investigation leads them to popular local hangout Jackie's Caf&#233;; after questioning the patrons, the boys hear a commotion outside and find Everdred lying injured in an alley. The crime boss explains how he had stolen the Mani Mani Statue from Carpainter in order to sell it to Monotoli, but Everdred was betrayed by Monotoli and left for dead. Everdred also gives Ness a hint on how to reach the world of Moonside through the Caf&#233;, which supposedly leads to Monotoli himself.[CR]Ness and Jeff emerge in Moonside, a dangerously-twisted version of Fourside where the inhabitants spout gibberish and nothing is as it seems. After getting their bearings, the boys wind through the labyrinthine streets and reach the mirror version of the Monotoli Building at the city's center. They find Monotoli cowering in front of the evil Mani Mani Statue, which attacks the party with powerful PSI abilities before being destroyed by Ness and Jeff. The moment the statue breaks, the pair find themselves standing in an empty warehouse behind Jackie's Caf&#233;; apparently the world of Moonside was only an illusion generated by the Mani Mani. Although the source of Monotoli's power has been destroyed, Monotoli himself escapes from the Caf&#233;, leaving the party without any further leads towards rescuing Paula.[CR]Apple Kid soon calls Ness to inform him about his latest invention, a Gourmet Yogurt Dispenser, that is being sent via Escargot Express' "Neglected Class". Unfortunately, the courier responsible for the delivery arrives empty-handed, but he mentions the package was lost down a hole somewhere in Dusty Dunes Desert. This hole turns out to be the Monkey Cave, a large simian colony watched over by the prophet Talah Rama, who discusses the party's destiny before turning Apple Kid's yogurt dispenser over to Ness. One of the monkeys also teaches PSI Teleport to Ness, allowing the party to instantly warp between previously-visited areas.[CR]Ness and Jeff return to Fourside and meet Electra, a housemaid who works in the Monotoli Building. She is thrilled to finally locate a yogurt dispenser and invites Ness to Monotoli's private penthouse on the forty-eighth floor. The duo arrive and easily gain access to the penthouse; however, a Clumsy Robot blocks the door leading to Paula and unleashes a salvo of powerful attacks. Suddenly, members of the Runaway Five rush into the room and switch off the robot, allowing Ness and Jeff to proceed and confront Monotoli, who apologizes profusely for the kidnapping and immediately releases Paula. Monotoli even offers his own private helicopter for the party's use, but it is stolen by Pokey in a dramatic escape; Monotoli explains that Pokey is heading for Summers, a coastal resort town. The party hitches a ride back to Threed on the Runaway Five's tour bus so that Jeff can make repairs to the Sky Runner. After a brief stopover in Winters to visit the fourth "Your Sanctuary" location at Rainy Circle, Dr. Andonuts upgrades the Sky Runner's range so that it can reach Summers.Summers &amp; ScarabaBrick Road as Dungeon Man[CR]The Sky Runner does not survive its second crash-landing on Summers' sandy beaches; Ness and his friends emerge relatively unscathed and begin exploring their surroundings. Finding evidence of Pokey's recent presence, the party soon wanders into the neighboring port town of Toto and finds a charter boat captain that can sail across the sea to Scaraba, Pokey's next destination. However, the captain can't sail until his wife leaves the Stoic Club, an avant-garde and exclusive club for intellectuals in Summers. Ness obtains the club's secret phone number and makes reservations; after finding the captain's wife, she agrees to resume her business as a street vendor selling Magic Cake. One bite of the confection sends Ness into a strange dream-like state, where he observes a young man in foreign clothing undergoing intense training.[CR]Meanwhile, in the far-distant country of Dalaam, Prince Poo is on the brink of completing his special "Mu training". After a particularly intense session of deep meditation, Poo's master acknowledges his pupil's success and instructs the young prince to accompany Ness, a child hero from Eagleland who has recently arrived in Summers. Poo immediately teleports to Summers and pledges his loyalty to Ness and his friends; Poo's ruby also allows the party to enter a special exhibit inside Summers' Cultural Museum, where they learn about a certain Pyramid in Scaraba that happens to be of great interest to Pokey. Ness soon receives a strange call from the curator of Fourside's Dinosaur Museum, Mr. Spoon. He implores Ness to retrieve the signature of Venus, the hot new singer at the Topolla Theater. Venus obliges by signing a banana peel, allowing the party to enter a hidden manhole in the Dinosaur Museum leading into Fourside's sewers; at the sewer's end lies the fifth "Your Sanctuary" spot at Magnet Hill. A key found at Magnet Hill also opens the path to Pink Cloud in Dalaam, the sixth "Your Sanctuary", where the powerful Thunder and Storm brothers conjure up devastating lightning attacks.[CR]With only two melodies remaining, Ness and his friends charter a boat and sail to Scaraba, but they are attacked by the fearsome Kraken, scourge of the seven seas. They sink the monster and make port in Scaraba before crossing the searing desert to reach the Sphinx. After solving its riddle, the party battles through the Pyramid and retrieves the Hawk Eye, an ancient gem that can pierce through any darkness. The wise Star Master greets the party upon exiting the Pyramid and asks Poo to accompany him, offering special training in a new PSI technique called "Starstorm". Poo is whisked away while Ness, Jeff and Paula continue through southern Scaraba and eventually reach Dungeon Man, Brick Road's ultimate creation; in fact, Dungeon Man is literally Brick Road himself, who was transformed by Dr. Andonuts into a living dungeon after meeting Jeff in Winters.[CR]Dungeon Man's interior proves to be a lengthy trek, but the trio eventually reach Brick Road's face embedded in a wall, who agrees to accompany Ness and his friends for awhile before getting wedged between several nearby palm trees. Although he can no longer move, Dungeon Man still offers to assist the party with an old submarine he had kept in his collection. Jeff repairs the vehicle and the group sets off across the ocean towards the stinking swamps of Deep Darkness.Deep Darkness &amp; Lost UnderworldFire Spring, the final "Your Sanctuary"[CR]Mobility is a luxury in Deep Darkness, a jungle so thick that no sunlight reaches the ground. Using the power of the Hawk Eye, Ness and company slowly forge ahead and battle a revitalized Master Belch (now calling himself Master Barf); Poo returns during the battle and demonstrates his new Starstorm technique, putting an end to Barf once and for all. The party also stumbles across Pokey's crashed helicopter before discovering Tenda Village, a tribe of diminutive green creatures afflicted with crippling shyness. The tribe's chief mentions a certain book that might alleviate their condition but offers no leads on where to find it.[CR]As the party leaves the village, Apple Kid calls again to inform Ness about Dr. Andonuts' recent disappearance just before being abducted himself by an unknown assailant. His counterpart Orange Kid calls immediately afterward and mentions Apple Kid was last seen near Dr. Andonuts' lab; several more abductions have taken place by the time Ness reaches the lab. Apple Kid's pet mouse explains how his master was taken beneath Stonehenge by aliens and passes on the Eraser Eraser, Apple Kid's last invention, which clears the path to the aliens' underground base.[CR]Several varieties of hostile aliens roam beneath Stonehenge including Giygas' elite force of Starmen troops. Deep inside the alien base, the party discovers the abductees encased in glass tubes before encountering Starman DX, the base's leader. Defeating this powerful psychic shuts down Stonehenge Base and releases the human captives, including Apple Kid, who mentions a book he recently returned to Onett's Library titled "Overcoming Shyness". Ness warps to Onett and locates the book, giving much-needed confidence to the taciturn Tenda tribe and opening a new passage underneath the village leading to the seventh "Your Sanctuary", Lumine Hall.[CR]Another hole at the end of Lumine Hall drops the party into an enormous subterranean cave known as the Lost World, an area filled with prehistoric creatures. A splinter tribe of less-shy Tenda also inhabit the area; inside their protective enclosure, the party meets a talking rock who expounds upon the nature of the world's "Your Sanctuary" locations before directing Ness towards Fire Spring and the final melody. Lava flows and suffocating heat are nothing compared to the firey enemies that attack Ness and his friends here, culminating in a grueling two-part boss battle against the blazing Carbon Dog and the nearly-invulnerable Diamond Dog. Once both dogs have been brought to heel, Ness reaches the sanctuary spot and finally completes the Sound Stone's melody, causing him to suddenly fall into a deep slumber.MagicantNess's Nightmare in the Sea of Eden[CR]Ness dreams of himself as an infant exhibiting his psychic abilities for the very first time. The scenery changes, and Ness finds himself in his pajamas wandering amidst the surreal and colorful landscape of Magicant, a world of dreams inside his own mind. The images of several familiar characters such as Pokey and Everdred also appear in Magicant, and Ness' family offers him a place to rest. The Star Master explains that Magicant is a reflection of Ness' psyche, and that Ness must confront the evil that exists inside himself. Flying Men, symbols of Ness' courage, fight alongside Ness as he winds down the spiraling path leading into the Sea of Eden, a representation of his subconscious.[CR]Mighty Kraken guard the shallow Sea of Eden and the strange golden object that lies at its center, which turns out to be a nightmare image of the Mani Mani Statue. Ness battles the familiar manifestation of evil and destroys it, overcoming the hatred in his own heart and unlocking his true psychic potential. The Sound Stone he once held disappears, and Ness awakens back in Fire Spring to see Paula, Jeff and Poo standing over him. After a short reunion, the party steels their resolve and teleports to Saturn Valley to begin preparations for the final battle.[CR]Upon returning to Saturn Valley, the team finds that Dr. Andonuts has constructed a spatial warp device called the Phase Distorter II; the original Phase Distorter was recently stolen by Pokey. After an unsuccessful test run, Dr. Andonuts determines that Zexonyte, an exotic rare element, is necessary to complete the new device; however, Zexonyte does not occur naturally on Earth and can only be found in meteorites. Ness and his friends teleport back to Onett and find the town in total chaos; powerful aliens terrorize the darkened streets and the local residents have barricaded themselves indoors. After checking on Ness' family, the party pushes on through Onett's foothills and retrieves a chunk of the still-glowing meteorite.[CR]Dr. Andonuts installs the Zexonyte while Ness and company rest up and replenish their items. After saying their goodbyes to the residents of Saturn Valley, the team climb aboard the Phase Distorter II and warp to a strange yet familiar cave in the Lost Underworld. They discover the wreck of the original Phase Distorter nearby, but Pokey is nowhere to be found. Yet another machine piloted by Dr. Andonuts soon appears inside the cave: the Phase Distorter III, which can warp both time and space. Giygas cannot be defeated in the present, but the chosen four may stand a chance by fighting him in the distant past. Unfortunately, time travel destroys organic matter, so the party agree to have their consciousnesses transferred into four humanoid robots before embarking on the last leg of their journey.EndgameExploring the Cave of the Past[CR]The Cave of the Past proves to be a harrowing gauntlet of the game's most powerful enemies, but Ness and his friends continue forward. Eventually the rocky terrain gives way to a pulsating organic chamber containing what looks like a gigantic eyeball. When the party approaches, the eye suddenly dilates, revealing Ness' own face in the center. Pokey appears as well to explain that despite the Apple of Enlightenment's prediction, Giygas cannot be defeated. Giygas is no longer just a supremely-evil being; he has become evil itself. True to his word, the party's attacks have no effect as Giygas begins his devastating psychic assault. Ness and his friends regroup and focus their energy toward Pokey, who is soon forced to retreat. Before leaving, Pokey switches off the "Devil's Machine", a device that had kept Giygas' incalculable power in check. This reveals the true face of their enemy: a swirling, nebulous mass of evil power with no discernible form or consciousness.[CR]Giygas' attacks in this state are indistinct, yet overwhelmingly powerful; there is no defense against them, psychic or otherwise. As the party endures the onslaught, Pokey reappears to taunt Ness at the brink of his defeat and mentions that at this point even praying would be useless. Ironically, Paula's "Pray" command turns out to be the key to victory; her prayers are somehow sent out across time and space, reaching the hearts of those people whose lives were touched by the party's positive energy. As the game's various characters across the world begin to pray, their energy is directed back towards Giygas, dealing increasing amounts of damage. Eventually, even the player is called upon to pray for the safety of Ness and his friends, causing a ludicrous amount of critical damage against Giygas. The evil entity spits incomprehensible gibberish in his death throes and slowly dissolves into a familiar red static, finally ending Earth's long war against Giygas.[CR]The battered mechanical shells of Ness, Paula, Jeff and Poo lie motionless on the ground after their victory, but their souls manage to return to their bodies in Saturn Valley, where they receive a hero's welcome. Poo returns to Dalaam's throne, Jeff reunites with his father Dr. Andonuts, and Ness agrees to escort Paula back to Twoson before returning home to his family in Onett, where they view a photo album compiled during his journey.[CR]After the credits roll, Ness is once again awoken in the middle of the night by loud knocking. This time Picky enters and hands over a letter addressed to Ness from Pokey, which reads: "Come and get me, loser! Spankety spankety spankety!"[CR]Cast of Characters[CR]Playable CharactersFour children destined to save the worldNess - The main protagonist of the game. A plucky, if a little quiet, boy with untapped psychic potential that began manifesting as early as when he was an infant. He lives at home with his supportive mother and (presumably) hard working father, who is never actually seen in the course of the game. When a meteor crashes near his house in the suburbs of Onett he goes to investigate with his selfish, rude neighbor, who thinks Ness is his best friend, and his life changes forever. After a visit from Buzz-Buzz, a bee from the future, he is called to arms against the intergalactic warlord Giygas. Ness' primary psychic attack takes the name of whatever is listed as the players favorite thing, the primary default name is "Rockin".Paula - An extremely powerful psychic raised by her parents in the Polestar Preschool in the city of Twoson. She calls to Ness in his dreams, saying she's in danger, and trying to give him hints as to where she is, but she doesn't know exactly where that is. When Ness reaches Twoson, it turns out she's been abducted. Ness gives chase, leading him through a treacherous mountain to the other side of a large river. When Ness arrives, all he sees are cultists espousing Happy Happyism. Investigation later leads him to Paula, after which the cultists turn hostile. Ness defeats the Carpainter, using the Franklin badge provided by Paula to deflect his lightning, and she agrees to come with him afterward. She lends her powerful psychic attacks, as well as her unpredictable "prayer" action. She attacks using a frying pan, and can equip ribbons.Jeff - A super-genius at a private school in Winters. After an unfortunate run-in with some zombies and other undead menaces in Threed, Paula uses her psychic powers to reach out and call Jeff. With his best friend's aid, he breaks out of the oddly secure school after looting several cookies and barely-working weapons. He makes his way to Threed, with the help of a gum addicted Bubble Monkey, the legendary Nessie, and his father, who fails to recognize him, Dr. Andonuts' spaceship, he crashes through the ground in Threed, and using a brilliant invention, liberates the trapped duo. There are items throughout the game that only he can use, most notably the super-powerful bottle-rockets, and he can even wield guns in battle.Poo - A disciplined martial artist who is on the brink of completing his training when he is introduced to us. Unlike other party members, who are summoned psychically, Poo is brought into the dapper trio after Ness eats some suspect "magic cake" at the Stoic Club in the resort town of Summers. Poo lives in the mystical floating country of Dalaam, and as he goes to complete his "Mu training," the spirits of his ancestors arrive and destroy his body, taking away everything he has. His acceptance of the loss completes the training, and he uses his teleport skill to join Ness and company. Not only is he powerful unarmed combatant with his fists, but can find get special items that only he can use. He briefly leaves the party to learn the mighty Psi-Starstorm.Supporting CharactersNess' Mom - A sweet and caring woman who supports Ness in all his endeavors and loves meeting his friends. The party can visit her anytime to rest and receive a hearty helping of Ness' favorite food.Tracy - Ness' sister. Shortly after Ness leaves home, she gets a part-time job working for Escargot Express and can store or deliver items for the party's use.Ness' Dad - Represented by a ringing telephone, Ness' absentee father supplies the party with cash based on defeated enemies; he can also save the game.King - Ness' dog. While very brave when he initially joins the party, King gets scared once Ness reaches the meteor site and runs back home, where he remains for the rest of the game.Buzz Buzz - A sentient insect who has traveled through time to warn Ness about his devastated future. Just before his untimely death he passes on the Sound Stone, an artifact which gives Ness the power to defeat Giygas.Apple Kid - A young inventor with a shabby appearance and a serious lack of funding. Apple Kid's research yields several useful items throughout the course of the game.Dr. Andonuts - The somewhat-negligent father of Jeff who doesn't even recognize his own son immediately, but does provide several useful inventions throughout the game.Brick Road / Dungeon Man - A man obsessed with RPG clich&#233;s who has constructed a short dungeon to challenge would-be adventurers. He appears to be friendly, giving the party helpful items and opportunities to rest, as well as signs to guide them along the way. After being transformed by Dr. Andonuts into a living dungeon himself, Dungeon Man eventually becomes wedged between two trees in southern Scaraba, but he doesn't seem too disturbed by the development.Picky Minch - Pokey's younger brother. In reality, he is actually more responsible and much braver than Pokey. His role as support for the party is brief, but he can be helpful on the way back from the meteor crash site near Ness' house.Mr. Saturn - Strange creatures that inhabit Saturn Valley. After being freed from slavery inside Master Belch's secret base, the Mr. Saturns support Ness and his friends during their final battle against Giygas.Major EnemiesGiygas - An alien warlord who has set his sights on Earth. He is also an impossibly powerful psychic; in the future, Giygas has already succeeded in conquering the known universe. According to Mother's backstory, Giygas (or Giegue) was raised by a human named Maria. When Maria's husband stole the secrets of PSI from Giygas' race, Giygas swore vengance against humanity. He was stopped by Maria's great-grandson Ninten, the protagonist of Mother, and his friends. Giygas was ultimately defeated by his own emotional connection to a song taught to him by Maria; after his defeat, he resolves to seek out evil so strong that it would harden him against such weakness. Evidently he succeeded, becoming himself a nebulous mass of pure evil.Pokey Minch - Ness' selfish, overweight neighbor and outspoken acquaintance. After hearing Buzz-Buzz's grim warning about the future, Pokey quickly joins what he calls "the winning side" and abducts Paula in the name of Giygas. He is extremely cowardly and even pretends to reform during the course of the game, only to immediately taunt Ness again before fleeing.Frank Fly - The leader of Onett's gang of Sharks who also serves as Ness' first major boss fight. Frank uses a pair of knives to attack, as well as lowering Ness' Guts with nasty remarks. Once he's defeated, Frank climbs into his homemade robotic tank "Frankystein Mk. II" for a surprise rematch. After destroying Frank's tank, Frank immediately reforms and will restore the party's HP and PP at any time, offering words of encouragement to Ness and his friends.Mani Mani Statue - This strange gold horned statue resembling an Academy Award "Oscar" statuette seemingly stalks Ness and company throughout much the game. Wherever they go, the statue is always close behind, emitting a disturbing aura. Not until the land of Moonside is the Mani-Mani revealed for what it truly is: a symbol of evil. The statue makes one final appearance in Magicant as Ness' Nightmare.Master Belch - A hideous blue blob utterly dedicated to Giygas who is responsible for the plague of zombies that overrun the town of Threed. He possesses a crippling addiction to "fly honey" and has kidnapped several Mr. Saturn to aid in the manufacture of the substance. Master Belch later reappears in the Deep Darkness as the palette-swapped Master Barf.[CR]North American Retail Release[CR]EarthBound's box definitely stood out on store shelves due to its size.[CR]Before even plugging the game in the system, players were greeted by an amazingly large box for EarthBound. The reason for the large size was very simple: Nintendo included an official player's guide for the game inside every copy of the game. It was a full color and full length guide, with pages adorned by clay sculptures of many of the enemies in game. Similar clay sculptures were made for the official Mother 3 fanguide, created by the devoted fans at Starmen.net and Fangamer.[CR]Also included in the guide were six scratch and sniff cards, with pictures of some of the grosser enemies of the game, Master Barf included. Also included was a mystery scratch and sniff card, where the purchaser could send in a guess to Nintendo about what they were smelling. The correct answer? Pizza. Players who correctly guessed the answer found a package from Nintendo weeks later, containing an Earthbound branded air freshener, which smelled like pizza as well and had an image of the Mach Pizza delivery man.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]EarthBound's soundtrack was produced by Hiroshi Kanazu, Keiichi Suzuki, and Hirokazu Tanaka and released only in Japan by Sony Records. It doesn't contain all of the tracks from Earthbound but only most of the best ones. The last 3 songs are not in the game at all but they are interesting remixes (shown as "PSI Mixes") of other songs in the game. Due to popular demand in Japan this album was re-released with Mother 1+2 in 2004[CR]1.[CR]"Prologue"[CR]Hirokazu Tanaka[CR]&#12503;&#12525;&#12525;&#12540;&#12464;[CR]1:05[CR]2.[CR]"Theme of Onett"[CR]Keiichi Suzuki[CR]&#12458;&#12493;&#12483;&#12488;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]1:20[CR]3.[CR]"Theme of Twoson"[CR]Suzuki[CR]&#12484;&#12540;&#12477;&#12531;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]1:22[CR]4.[CR]"Theme of Saturn Valley"[CR]Suzuki[CR]&#12469;&#12479;&#12540;&#12531;&#12496;&#12524;&#12540;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]0:49[CR]5.[CR]"Theme of Winters"[CR]Tanaka[CR]&#12454;&#12451;&#12531;&#12479;&#12540;&#12474;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]3:46[CR]6.[CR]"Theme of Threek"[CR]Suzuki[CR]&#12473;&#12522;&#12540;&#12463;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]1:33[CR]7.[CR]"Theme of Doko Doko Desert"[CR]Tanaka[CR]&#12489;&#12467;&#12489;&#12467;&#30722;&#28448;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]0:53[CR]8.[CR]"Theme of Fourside"[CR]Suzuki[CR]&#12501;&#12457;&#12540;&#12469;&#12452;&#12489;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]1:47[CR]9.[CR]"Theme of Moonside"[CR]Tanaka[CR]&#12512;&#12540;&#12531;&#12469;&#12452;&#12489;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]0:57[CR]10.[CR]"Theme of Ramma"[CR]Suzuki, Tanaka[CR]&#12521;&#12531;&#12510;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]1:57[CR]11.[CR]"Theme of Summers"[CR]Hiroshi Kanazu[CR]&#12469;&#12510;&#12540;&#12474;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]1:02[CR]12.[CR]"Theme of Scarabi"[CR]Suzuki, Tanaka[CR]&#12473;&#12459;&#12521;&#12499;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]3:05[CR]13.[CR]"Theme of the Dungeon Man"[CR]Kanazu, Tanaka[CR]&#12480;&#12531;&#12472;&#12519;&#12531;&#30007;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]1:15[CR]14.[CR]"Theme of the Cursed Jungle"[CR]Suzuki[CR]&#39764;&#22659;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]1:38[CR]15.[CR]"Theme of the Gumi Village"[CR]Suzuki, Tanaka[CR]&#12464;&#12511;&#12398;&#26449;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]0:58[CR]16.[CR]"Theme of the Underworld"[CR]Suzuki[CR]&#22320;&#24213;&#22823;&#38520;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]1:35[CR]17.[CR]"Theme of Magicant"[CR]Tanaka[CR]&#12510;&#12472;&#12459;&#12531;&#12488;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]4:43[CR]18.[CR]"Theme of the Great Underworld"[CR]Tanaka[CR]&#26368;&#20302;&#22269;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]1:31[CR]19.[CR]"Theme of the Final Battle"[CR]Tanaka[CR]&#26368;&#32066;&#25126;&#38360;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]4:06[CR]20.[CR]"Theme of Love &amp; Peace"[CR]Suzuki[CR]&#24179;&#21644;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]2:07[CR]21.[CR]"Ending Theme"[CR]Suzuki, Tanaka[CR]&#12456;&#12531;&#12487;&#12451;&#12531;&#12464;&#12398;&#12486;&#12540;&#12510;[CR]9:31[CR]22.[CR]"Room Number (PSI Mix)"[CR]Tanaka[CR]&#12523;&#12540;&#12512;&#12490;&#12531;&#12496;&#12540; (PSI MIX)[CR]4:00[CR]23.[CR]"Hula-hoop (PSI Mix)"[CR]Tanaka[CR]&#12501;&#12521;&#12501;&#12540;&#12503; (PSI MIX)[CR]3:35[CR]24.[CR]"Another 2 (PSI Mix) ~ And Goes On"[CR]Tanaka[CR]ANOTHER 2 (PSI MIX) ~and goes on[CR]5:14[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Ness' name is an anagram for SNES, or just a reference to Nintendo's first system, the NES.The character name Lier X. Agerate is wordplay of Liar Exaggerate.The towns of Earthbound have numbers in their name according to the order Ness travels to. ONEtt, TWOson, THREEd, FOURside. These places may also mean that their sum is ten. Like in SUMmers and TENda Village.According to Mother franchise creator Shigesato Itoi, Jeff's friend Tony is gay.The invention called the Sky Runner was originally called the Sky Walker, but it was changed to avoid copyright issues with Star Wars, which features characters with the surname Skywalker.Itoi claims much of the game is based on his personal experiences. For instance, the final boss's dialogue is based on a recollection from his childhood of accidentally wandering into an exploitation movie and witnessing an onscreen rape. The movie The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty (an obscure Japanese mystery film) is said to influence Giygas.The game contains several Beatles references. For example, there is a yellow submarine whose color is "purely coincidental" and an non-player character who gives the player a pop quiz "A Beatles song, XXXterday. Can you fill in the blanks?" with the choices being 'Yes' or 'No'. There are several alleged samples from Beatles songs in some of the game's music.Internal code was written to check for genuine Super Nintendo devices, by detecting the total RAM count. Upon failing these checksum tests, the game is modified to show an anti-piracy message at start-up. While playing the game in this state, the world is populated with exponentially more enemy encounters than normal. Should the player make it all the way to the final boss, the game intentionally freezes before the fight begins, and upon restarting the game, all save data is erased. These effects can be replicated using a cheat code device.There is a girl in Magicant who, in the English localization, introduces herself as Nico before inviting Ness to sing, dance, and play with her. This character is not named in the original Japanese text. Localization editor Marcus Lindblom was given permission to insert his newborn daughter's name in the game.[CR]				[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Exit Mouse in the Cave of the Past[CR]Note: This only works in the Super Famicom version of Earthbound(Mother 2).[CR]In Mother 2, you could use the Exit Mouse in the Cave of the Past, which was never intended obviously, since the feature is missing in Earthbound.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Exit Mouse in the Cave of the Past[CR]You can use the Rock Candy in battles an unlimited amount of times to increase your stats. You have to have it in one of the two very bottom spaces of one of your characters' inventories, and you have to use it with any condiment (preferably something like Sugar Packets or Jars of Delisauce, because they will increase one of your stats by 2 instead of one). This will allow you to get greater boosts in stats when you level up.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] $50 Easy in Twoson[CR]Outside of the hotel room in Twoson, there will be a man sitting at a table. Constantly speak to him (his response will change each time) until he decides to hand you $50 so you can leave him alone. It takes about 20 sessions of talking for him to fork it over, but it's well worth it, plus it'll make up for the night you spent at the hotel.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] $50 Easy in Twoson[CR]If you go into a room with a large amount or any amount of enemies in it, you can exit the room and re-enter it and the amount of enemies changes sometimes even taking them all out of that room.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Earthworm Jim is a side-scroller shooter from Shiny Entertainment and the first game in their Earthworm Jim series. The player assumes the role of the eponymous annelid who is able to shoot in multiple directions with his space blaster, with the ultimate goal of saving the galaxy from Queen Slug-for-a-Butt. The game is best known for its surreal sense of humor and fluid animations.[CR]Earthworm Jim premiered in the October of 1994 for multiple platforms. It saw a sequel the subsequent year: Earthworm Jim 2. In 2010, Earthworm Jim received HD rereleases for modern consoles.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Jim was just an ordinary earthworm who, early one morning, was running from some crows when an indestructible, high-tech super suit (created by the evil genius Professor Monkey-for-a-Head) fell onto him from the sky and, by some wonderful coincidence, the opening of the suit landed on him, and in he went, transforming him into the amazing annelid we've all come to love. Then he took out his gun and exploded the crows who had been chasing him.[CR]The suit had been dropped by a space ship that was being attacked by Psy-Crow, an evil henchman for the Evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Pus-Filled, Malformed Slug-for-a-Butt (or Queen Slug-for-a-Butt in short). The suit was originally designed for her to help her take over the galaxy (...though she probably could never fit in it). Psy-Crow comes to earth to look for the suit but only finds the scorch marks made by the impact of the suit and the exploded crows. He radios Queen Slug-for-a-Butt and they talk about their evil plans for her sister, Princess What's-Her-Name (this game likes its hyphens). Unbeknownst to Psy-Crow, Earthworm Jim was hiding and heard everything. Mustering up some new-found courage, Jim decides to embark on a quest to rescue the beautiful princess.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Jim begins his quest to rescue Princess What's-Her-Name in the game's first level, "New Junk City". There, Jim is introduced to concepts that will be seen throughout most of the course of the game. This includes the use of chains, rope, moss, etc. to climb horizontally, attempting to avoid the peril of landing on spikes, and swinging from hook to hook via Jim's head (using his worminess as a whip). Each level has its own unique gameplay elements to cope with as well. This level in particular includes obstacles such as bouncy piles of tires and zip-lines the player has to use to get Jim to his destination.Jim firing his blaster[CR]Jim will almost immediately encounter baddies at the start of the game. His weapons include a little red blaster and his own earthworm body. Either weapon can be used almost at any time, though on occasion one can be more effective than the other (the gun can stun a crow, but it takes a little longer to kill than by just using the whip, which only takes a single lash. However, the crow must be at the right distance or it's ineffective). Jim's blaster has a full automatic fire rate although it's ammo is capped at 5000. Additional ammo can be picked up throughout the level (the little blaster symbols floating around). Should Jim run out of ammo, the blaster will recharge up to one hundred bullets by itself. There are also Mega Blaster bullets that can be found in a few places in every level. Each Mega Blaster upgrade is good for one shot, delivering a large, devastating beam that destroys any lower enemy with one touch.[CR]Though a platforming game at heart, each level has its own special twists to the formula, breaking up the run-and-gun-and-jump model to deliver on such things as riding hamsters or bungee jumping.[CR]Planets[CR]New Junk CIty[CR]Jim starts off his adventure in this junk yard which he must get through to defeat both Billy the Bin and New Junk City's owner, Chuck.Andy Asteroids?[CR]Jim jumps on his Pocket Rocket and races with Psy-Crow to the end of the level, avoiding asteroids along the way.Psy-Crow[CR]A level that the player only has to complete if Jim loses against Psy-Crow in the Andy Asteroids? level, Jim must have a one on one battle with the mad crow himself to continue.What The Heck?[CR]Planet heck is a strange hell-type planet. This is where Evil the Cat lives and where the player must defeat the likes of lawyers and an un-meltable snowman. The player must complete the level while listening to horrifying elevator music.Down the Tubes[CR]Down the Tubes is an underwater level in which Jim must ride giant hamsters, knock over Bob the Killer GoldFish and complete the infamous tube race.Snot a problem[CR]Major Mucus is out to get Jim! Compete with him in a 3 round battle in which Jim and him both bungee jump down to infested waters and fight by swinging into each other and seeing which cord breaks first.Level 5[CR]The 5th level takes place in Professor Monkey for a head's lab. Watch out though, Jim may just lose his suit, make sure to get it back.Who Turned Out The Lights?[CR]A hidden area found in Level 5 which is completely blacked out besides spotlights, the enemies' eyes and doors.For Pete's Sake[CR]Jim has to escort a cute, tiny puppy named Peter through a level that consists of holes, tentacles and meteor showers. Peter is a small cute timid little dog, but when very frightened he becomes a raging monstrous Hulkish beast.Intestinal Distress[CR]The level takes place in the intestines of a strange creature and at the end of the tunnel Jim must face off against Doc Duodenum. The level is missing from the SNES and PC versions of the game.Buttville[CR]It's all come down to this, Jim is nearing the end of his journey! At the end of stage, prepare to face off against the appropriately named The Evil Queen Pulsating, Bloated, Festering, Sweaty, Stinky, Pus-filled, Malformed, Slug-for-a-Butt.[CR]Avatar Awards[CR]The XBLA version has 2 avatar awards to be earned.Earthworm Jim Suit - Complete a bonus level.Earthworm Jim T-Shirt - (Achievement: Bin Collector) Beat Billy the Bin in New Junk City.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Earthworm Jim has an awesome soundtrack which consists of -Banjo RaceSnot a ProblemParty TimeFallingWhat the HeckButtsvilleBass MixJunkitBos AnneildPsy-crowDarkworm RagSubmergedYou're the bestEnd theme[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Cheat Codes[CR]Pause the game before entering these codes:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Cheat Codes[CR]Press pause and then press:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Strange Death[CR]This is a very simple code, but it's kind of funny. When you are at the Buttville stage where you must use the helicopter head to fly downwards: There are two different paths to take in order to complete the stage. Take the left one, but don't leave yet, just stand on the ground near the exit. Now, run into the thorns until Jims health reaches from 20% to 30%. Now when you get hit this time- the second you get hit, run to the exit where you get warped to the next stage and Jim won't be dead yet. You'll appear in the next stage,now quickly run as soon as the stage begins, and it looks like Jim has a heart attack or something because he dies for no reason- this is most likely because the game couldn't calculate the damage taken by the thorns fast enough to make Jim die in the previous stage.</plot>

				<title_clean>Earthworm Jim 2</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Earthworm Jim 2 takes place right after the first game with our favorite worm hero, Earthworm Jim! He is once again caught up in another adventure as his old foe, Psycrow has taken interest in Jim's love interest, Princess What's Her Name. It's up to Jim to stop his enemies yet again in order to save his love, or in any other case, become the hero and save the day (again). But this time, Jim is not alone as his best friend Snot (a booger) joins him on his quest by making Jim stick to certain parts of any level and swing him into action. Along with his trusty Plasma Gun and a new Manta Shield, Jim must traverse into strange new levels and stop Psycrow before it's too late![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Earthworm Jim 2 has the same basic controls as the first game but with a few extra features added in. One of the first few things is that Jim does have a new friend called Snot and he can use him as a grapple like hook to get to some extra parts of the level. But in order to use Snot, make sure to find green spots on top of certain areas in the level. Replacing Jim's copter from the last game, Jim can use Snot to float down to other areas in order to catch himself.[CR]There is also some added items for Jim to collect and other weapons in this game. Jim can now collect Can O' Worms this time around by going into hidden areas in the level as well as collect health that goes up to 200%. Also as an added bonus, Jim can now collect Flags so that if you do collect all three flags in a given level, you unlock a password so that you can enter the level again.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]With the age of technology upon us, Jim now must travel to new, strange and often times, creepy, levels in order to get to Psycrow and save his love. But Jim must face many dangers in his path of justice and a hero has to start somewhere in the game and nowhere involves the beginning of any game then with pigs.Anything but Tangerines[CR]The start of Jim's crazy adventure begins in a distant planet of some kind where he encounters one of his foes, Bob the Goldfish and Number 4, his trusty cat friend with muscles the size of a few planets. Jim must use pigs in this level in order to bypass the many traps and falling grandmas in order to face Bob and defeat him in an epic battle of wits (or in this case, Bon's wits vs. Jim's small I.Q.).Lorenzo's Soil/Lorenzen's Soil[CR]Depending on what version of EWJ 2 you have, you might get a different name for this level in the game. Jim is deep underground and has a drill laser gun with unlimited ammo to get out of the dirt. However, he must collect clocks in order to stay alive. By the time you reach the end of this crazy place, Jim must face Pedro Pupa, a larvae on a unicycle in order to move on on his journey.Puppy Love Parts I, II and III[CR]Throughout the game, Jim must stop and ponder what he has to do in life but Psycrow has other plans by kidnapping the nephew's of Peter Puppy, Jim's best friend with anger management issues like no other. Using a giant marshmallow (where he found it, I don't know) and bounce the puppies back into Peter's home. Psycrow will throw in a bomb in there as well so make sure Jim can manage to get it to Peter. But don't drop any puppies, you really don't want to see Peter that mad and tear Jim's head of his super suit.The Villi People[CR]Jim's Now a Blind Cave Salamander!: As the title says, Jim has become a blind cave salamander and this level just gets the vote for making it the most interesting and weird level in an Earthworm Jim game. Just throw in a chance to be on a game show to actually get some prizes and this level has it all. Well, actually, it really does have a game show towards the end of the level and the questions are just plain weird and doesn't make any sense but hey, this is an Earthworm Jim game.The Flyin King[CR]Looks like Major Mucus hasn't learned his lesson since he and Jim fought in the first game and now he is back and greener then ever. Jim rides his trusty rocket and must move a bomb from one side of the level to the Major himself but it is no easy task when you got ships and people coming at you. Jim must be careful for if that bomb explodes at any time, he must go back to the beginning and do it all over again.Udderly Abducted[CR]Well, as the title suggests, aliens are trying to take all the cows on the planet and it looks like Jim has to stop them. The only way for Jim to even go past a checkpoint in the game is to literally pick up one of the many cows and milk them to get the checkpoint gate open. But you can't level them for too long however cause if you do, the aliens will take them away. And to make matters worse for Jim, some cows are bombs and you must soak them with water before taking them to a checkpoint. Jim isn't getting any love around here, that's for sure.Inflated Head[CR]Looks like our favorite evil cat has returned from Heck to bring Jim some pain. Evil the Cat runs the Carnival of Scars and will stop at nothing to defeat Jim. Jim uses the power of hot air to inflate his head to go high into the level and reach the end. Jim must dodge many neon lights and light bulbs or he will be sent down a few levels or even towards the beginning of the level again.ISO9000[CR]By the time Jim reaches this level, he really wants this adventure to end. Jim must traverse into the world of the office worker and jumping filling cabinets in order to pass the level. Jim must always go into paper shredders to progress in the level. And did i mention that towards the end, you must stop and trap a running door in order to move on in the game? Yup, nothing like that in any game you know huh?Level Ate[CR]This is by far a level most people might not want to stay forever. As the name suggests, Jim must traverse in the world of food and a never ending salt shaker floating in the air and dropping salt you. Lucky you, you run into some running snails to prevent yourself from getting hurt like crazy. But once you get to the end, you must face Flamin' Yawn on a giant pizza box. Yup, only Jim can have these kinds of adventures.See Jim Run, Run Jim Run[CR]This is it. Jim finally made it towards the end of the game and now must face Psycrow in an epic battle of foot racing? Sure enough, a race towards the end of the level is the goal and Jim must beat Psycrow in a race in order to get the hand of the Princess. Jim must destroy many traps and hope to stay ahead from his foe or Jim's adventure might end on this dangerous trip.[CR]Game Boy Advance Version[CR]While Earthworm Jim 2 had many critics loving the game, a few scratched their heads in confusion and anger when they released the game on the Game Boy Advance/game-boy-advance/60-4/, which contained many problems from the original game. Instead of having a great game for the portable system, you get a game that wasn't even tested right and a very buggy game, many saying that it is the worst game to ever be ported in the Earthworm Jim series (and that says a lot considering how well Earthworm Jim 3D was received).[CR]		[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Button Codes[CR]Pause the game, then press:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Warp to Levels[CR]Press START, enter the following code:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Manta Shield[CR]Press Up+X simultaneously and you will use the Manta Shield. You will be invincible for a few seconds. This can be used as many times as you want.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Manta Shield[CR]About halfway through Level Ate, you will find three sets of forks positioned just to the right of a horizonatal piece of bacon. Use the Snott-Chute to float between the bacon and the left fork. You will enter a secret level called ''Forked''</plot>

				<plot>Elite Soccer lets the player choose from 24 National teams including the U.S., England, France, Brazil among others, in a chance to play in the World Cup tournament and win the coveted trophy.  Players can also choose to play in a Knockout-style tournament where instead of a round robin type of play like in World Cup, they instead play one game and advance to the next like a regular tournament.  There is also a two-player mode that allows friends to compete head-to-head.[CR]The main gameplay is the same as others with an overhead view with a third-person perspective for penalty kicks.  The rules and regulations are up to date and can actually be changed to suit the players style of choice.  They can also choose weather conditions, skills of goalies or even the choice to play either indoors or outdoors.  Players can also edit their players including appearance and stats wise to suit their liking.</plot>

				<plot>A generic football game, among the many back in the day, Emmitt Smith Football has the standard Exhibition and Season modes along with multiple camera angles.  It also features a 360 degree TV-style instant replay for bone-crunching and ground-breaking plays that are performed.[CR]The one thing that sets it apart from others is the ability to create and save (using battery back-up) 64 unique plays that can be accessed at any time during a game along with the standard pre-set plays. While it does not have NFL or NFLPA licenses, it does feature then former Dallas Cowboys running back star Emmitt Smith, who is also on the front cover of the box.</plot>

				<title_clean>Equinox</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Equinox is an isometric platforming and puzzle game for the Super Nintendo. It is the sequel to the NES game, Solstice. The player assumes the role of Glendaal, who is the son of the main character from Solstice, Shadax. Shadax has been captured by his former apprentice, Sonia. As the only person suitable for the task, Glendaal is asked in a letter from his father to stop Sonia. In order to do this, he must embark on a quest through eight dungeons of increasing difficulty, on eight different continents. In each dungeon, there is a guardian who must be defeated before the next continent (and thus, the next dungeon) can be accessed.[CR]In Japan the game is known as Solstice II.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Equinox is a hybrid of platforming and puzzles, in the sense that many of the puzzles arise from situations caused by its platforming element. For instance, Glendaal may need to reach a key or a potion on a ledge that at first appears to be out of reach until blocks are moved around the room, creating a functional staircase. As in standard platforming games, the player may jump and move around in any direction, although the isometric nature of the game makes moving in any but 4 directions a bit difficult. However, the game rarely abuses this fact. The isometric view is often exploited to such an effect as to have the player guessing the height off the ground that certain ledges are.[CR]The game is split into two distinct portions: the world map and the dungeons. On the world map, Glendaal is limited to jumping and playing a harp. The harp is used, when one progresses deep enough into the game, to teleport between certain locations. On the world map, trolls and bats appear, and will trigger a combat sequence similar to the dungeon mode of the game. Trolls and bats drop healing items and magic regenerating potions, respectively. Also, when a troll is defeated for the first time with a newly found weapon, the player's life gauge is increased.[CR]The dungeon portion of the game has a tighter control scheme and allows the player to use spells and weapons. Spells include a basic healing spell, effectively turning magic into health, as well as damage spells that hurt all enemies in a room. Weapons range from knives to axes to swords, although all weapons are thrown when used. Effectively, this makes all weapons ranged, even though in reality they are all melee in nature. While in the dungeons, players may find apples (which restore health), and potions (which restore magic). There are also keys, which unlock gates, leading to new areas to explore in the dungeon. These keys can only be used in the same dungeon they are found in. However, keys can be used for any door that is the same color as the key.[CR]Enemies in the dungeons range from ghosts to blobs, and they call come in multiple colors (representing difficulty). When the player defeats all of the enemies in a room, and acquires all of the items as well, enemies never reappear there. If an enemy comes into contact with the player, the player "dies" and returns to the point of entry to the room, as long as there are life points remaining. Because of this, rooms often need intelligent strategies to overcome, as any damage results in a restart, losing life each time.[CR]In order to progress through a dungeon, a player must find 12 tokens. These tokens are blue, shiny orbs located at difficult-to-reach spots throughout the dungeons. Once 12 tokens in a dungeon are found, the player must find a special room, wherein the dungeon guardian is summoned. The guardians are extremely difficult bosses that follow regular movement and attack patterns. Some of these bosses summon lesser monsters as well. Once the guardian is defeated, their spirit is no longer able to haunt the land, and the player can move on to the next region.[CR]Items[CR]Items in Equinox all come in four colors. These four colors help distinguish the potency of items (in the case of potions and apples), or simply distinguish usage (in the case of keys). You can only pick up items once; items never regenerate. Items come in the following colors, in order of potency:[CR]Green &lt; Blue &lt; Red &lt; WhiteKeys[CR]Keys are found throughout the dungeons of the game. A player may find dozens of keys in a single dungeon. Keys come in all four colors, but the colors only reflect the doors they are able to open.Potions[CR]Potions are found by slaying the bats on the world map, and in the various dungeons. A green potion is capable of filling a single point of magic, while a white potion fills all empty magic points.Apples[CR]Apples are found by slaying the trolls on the world map, and in the various dungeons. A green apple is capable of filling a single point of health, while a white potion fills all empty health points.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>ESPN Baseball Tonight</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]ESPN Baseball Tonight is a baseball game from Park Place Productions (Stormfront Studios developed the PC port) and published by Sony Imagesoft (now 989 Studios). It features the ESPN (the TV network) license and the MLB license, but not the MLBPA license.[CR]Like a few baseball games out at this time, the game features a lower perspective of the field while pitching/batting, almost level with the batter's POV. The screen doesn't transition to an overhead view while fielding, unlike many other baseball games. Along with the traditional tournament and exhibition modes, the player can try their hand at a Home Run Derby and receives a score based on how many homers they hit.[CR]ESPN Baseball Tonight was originally released on the Sega CD in 1993. It received additional versions for the core Sega Genesis system, the Super Nintendo and PC MS-DOS, all in 1994. It would be followed by other ESPN-branded sports games, the next being ESPN Sunday Night NFL in August 1994.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Steal Home with 100% Success[CR]When you are at bat and have runners on 1st and 3rd, send the runner on 1st to steal, followed immediately by the runner on 3rd. The catcher will without exception throw to try and get the runner at 2nd out, and the game AI does not have the 2nd baseman throw home to try to get out the player stealing home.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]ESPN National Hockey Night is a hockey game for the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis and Sega CD released towards the end of 1994. It is licensed by the NHL and features all the actual team names. It is also based on the ESPN TV show of the same name that aired between 1992-2004, and features the voice and digitized likeness of host Bill Clement.[CR]The game is the first to provide two different angles of the rink. Players can opt for a horizontal perspective that was popular with earlier hockey games or a vertical perspective which had become the norm for the EA Sports NHL series. The game features all 26 teams of the NHL and allows for up to four players (at least for the SNES version) to take part in Exhibition, Tournament and Season modes.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>ESPN Speedworld</title_clean>
				<plot>ESPN Speed World is a Super NES and Sega Genesis video game that involves the player controlling NASCAR Winston Cup stock cars as they do laps around various oval tracks, road courses, and superspeedways. All stock cars in the game have the capability to go up to 200 miles per hour (approximately 322 kilometers per hour). The object of the game is to get as close to first place as possible. This game uses Dr. Jerry Punch and an interactive pit crew to simulate the feeling of racing during the 1993 Winston Cup season. Like in most racing games, being in the top positions gives the player more points than being in the bottom positions. Stock cars can be customized with a choice of colors and styles.[CR]Sponsors in addition to automobile manufacturers are absent due to licensing difficulties. The real-life drivers of this era are also missing because the game only has an ESPN license and not an official NASCAR license. The Sega Genesis version shows more realistic detail in the car decals and advertising billboards than the Super NES version of the game.[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN_Speed_World[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Eurit</title_clean>
				<plot>Eurit is an action game that was being developed by Radical. The game is basically a souped up version of childhood games of Tag and Capture the Flag. The game features a split-screen and is an ideal two player game. A near complete beta of this game was discovered by DreamTR, and it is probably one of the best unreleased games for the snes.[CR]The story behind the game is that the ruler of the galaxy decides that he will retire. In order to find a suitable replacement, he sets up a tournament where wizards and warriors compete to determine who shall be ruler. Throughout the game, you travel to many worlds across the galaxy to prove your might.[CR]There are four characters to chose from at the start of the game. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses, based on their speed, spellcasting agility, and magic capacity. Through my playthrough, I used the average character.[CR]The gameplay is very addictive, and relatively easy to get into. Basically, one of the characters starts off being "it". The person who is it cannot capture flags, so they must chase down the other character and touch them. Once you are not it, you can collect flags necessary to win the stage. [CR]Complicating the game is the obstacles you face. To proceed through the level, you basically have to build platforms. There are many levels with enemy creatures that usually require a number of blasts with your gun to kill. Speed tiles send you running really quickly, which can either make you quickly escape your foe, or send you far away from him.[CR]Probably the most compelling gameplay feature for experts is the magic system. Before each level, you learn a new magic spell. Some spells are mundane, like destroying a platform, but others can devistate your opponent, like the spell that causes all the creatures in the level to attack your opponent. Powerup balls throughout the level allow you to charge your magic meter.[CR]The music is pretty typical "sci-fi game" fare, comparible to games like Blackthorne, B.O.B., and The Lost Vikings. The sound effects are somewhat muted, though the voice that tells you "player 1 is now it" is really well done. The graphics aren't anything too special, but they do the job.[CR]On the whole, I liked this game. Had it been released, it would be an instant 2-player classic. The controls are a bit touchy, though not terrible. I really liked the thrill of chasing your opponent down and make him "it".[CR]One caveat about this prototype is when you die. Although there is a password system, the game tends to crash after the death scene. I guess that is why they call it a prototype. Or perhaps it is just a problem with the emulator.[CR]I asked Darren Schebek, a programmer who worked on the game about why it was never released:[CR]"Radical tried very hard to find a publisher for Eurit (it was an original project being developed in-house), but in the end decided that the SNES market was kaput and canned the project very close to the end of development in order to cut their losses. Instead, they adapted the game for the newer platforms. The new, pseudo-3D version became Grid Runner on the PS1, Saturn, and PC. They later created another game[CR]DreamTR owns a prototype of this game, and has taken some shots of it. Oddly enough, the prototype cart says "property of Electronic Arts", suggesting that they may have been interested in publishing it.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Exertainment Mountain Bike Rally/Speed Racer is a pack-in compilation of two racing/driving games: Mountain Bike Rally (best known as Cannondale Cup) and Speed Racer in My Most Dangerous Adventures, both of which were released separately the month following this release. Both games have been configured to work with Life Fitness's "Exertainment"-brand stationary bike, which came built with an electronic component that could be linked to the Super Nintendo. The player's own exertions on the bike would power the protagonists' vehicles within the two games.[CR]The game is exceptionally rare, as only so many Exertainment bikes exist (and, as electronic stationary bikes, were very expensive even at the time) and this game was only available as a pack-in. It commands high prices from collectors as a result.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>This is a baseball game featuring 12 fictional teams, plus the player can also create 2 custom teams. Game modes include an Exhibition mode, an All Star game, a Pennant Race, and a Watch mode.[CR]While Exhibition mode can be either a one or two player affair, the All Star game is strictly for two players to compete in. When playing, batting and pitching are both done from a behind the batter viewpoint.[CR]The pennant race involves 6 teams playing each other throughout a season consisting of a number of games chosen by the player.[CR]Watch mode lets the player watch two computer controlled teams play each other.[CR]Options include either having automatic or manual fielding, having errors and/or wind on or off, and being able to either skip or watch opponents pennant games. There is also the Cold Game option, which lets a baseball game end when a team is winning by the  chosen amount of runs.</plot>

				<title_clean>F-Zero</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Title Screen[CR]F-Zero is a futuristic racing game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on August 23, 1991 (November 21, 1990 in Japan, June 4, 1992 in Europe). One of the few launch titles for the SNES, it is the first game to utilize of the platform's psuedo-3D technology, known as Mode 7, which uses the rotation, scaling, and perspective effects to give players the illusion that they are racing in a real-time 3D racetrack.[CR]The game takes place in the year 2560, where wealthy, intergalactic billionaires create a new brutal form of entertainment based on old Formula One races. The races, named F-Zero, used the latest technology (allowing machines to hover above the large track at incredible speeds). The player picks one of four pilots (including famous Captain Falcon, charismatic Dr. Stewart, alien Pico, and wily Samurai Goroh), each with their own machine that differ in both acceleration and maximum speed, and attempts to qualify in each of the fifteen circuits (split into three leagues: Knight, Queen, and King).[CR]F-Zero received a multitude of sequels for subsequent Nintendo platforms (including F-Zero X for the Nintendo 64 and F-Zero: Maximum Velocity for the Game Boy Advance) and obscure console expansions (including the BS F-Zero Grand Prix series for the Satellaview and F-Zero X Expansion Kit for the Nintendo 64DD). Each game in the series further expands the game's story and lore while adding a variety of crazy tracks (including those in full 3D).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In F-Zero, players must maneuver their incredibly-fast F-Zero machine around five laps of each circuit, avoiding various hazards (such as rough roads, slip zones, land mines, magnets, and the track's barriers) and other F-Zero machines (including critically damaged racers, which explode upon impact) while attempting to overtake and maintain a winning ranking among their computer-controlled rivals.Basic Controls and Handling[CR]Players use the B button to accelerate, the X or Y buttons to brake, the left and right parts of the D-Pad to steer left and right, and the L and R buttons to shift the machine's weight to the left or right (letting players slide around tight corners with ease).[CR]When the machine is in the air (due to hitting a jump plate), players can use the left and right parts of the D-Pad to steer the machine and the top and bottom parts of the D-Pad to adjust the machine's tilt, shortening or lengthening the jumping distance. Holding down on the D-Pad while landing a jump (in which the machine's rear is below its front) prevents an "impact shock" of landing incorrectly (which would cause the machine to decelerate).Speed Boost Arrow[CR]After each lap is completed, the player is awarded with a manual four-second turbo boost (called the "Super Jet", shown as the S symbol in the bottom-right of the screen), which can be triggered by pressing the A button. Players can only stock three Super Jets at one time.[CR]Several tracks also include helpful characteristics such as Ramps, Shortcuts and Speed Boost Arrows to help the drivers improve their time.Vitality[CR]Each F-Zero machine has a vitality gauge, called "Power", which is drained each time the player's machine hits various obstacles, such as the track's barrier and opponent machines. As the gauge depletes, the machine begins to visually malfunction, both the machine and the gauge flashing and twitching. If the gauge is fully depleted or the player falls off the track, the machine crashes in a loud, fiery explosion and the player is immediately disqualified from the race.[CR]Scattered throughout each circuit is a special "pit stop" strip. Players who drive over it slowly replenish the machine's vitality (due to a large floating machine that "heals" it).Disqualification[CR]When a player joins a league, they are given two "spare machines", which serve as the game's "lives". Players who are disqualified from a race must use up another machine in order to retry the race. If the player has no more machines, then the player ends the league with a Game Over.[CR]Players can gain an extra spare machine for each 10,000 points accumulated. Players gain points by completing laps and races, with better placement gaining more points:PlacementScore Per LapScore Per Circuit1st900 pts.2,500 pts.2nd600 pts.1,500 pts.3rd400 pts.1,000 pts.4th or Below200 pts.Disqualification, see below.[CR]Players can get disqualified from a circuit in one of two ways: destruction of the machine and elimination due to a poor position in the rankings. Each race is an "elimination race" for the player machine only, in which the player (starting somewhere in the top four) must finish each lap above a certain threshold (15th for the first lap, 10th for the second lap, 7th for the third lap, 5th for the fourth lap, and 3rd for the last lap).[CR]The game includes four difficulty settings: Beginner, Standard, Expert, and Master. Each setting increases the speed and aggressiveness of the opponent machines. Master difficulty is only unlocked after completing a league on the Expert difficulty.[CR]Playable Machines[CR]The game allows players to pick from one of four powerful F-Zero machines, each with their own strengths and weaknesses (in terms of the maximum speed possible with the craft, the quickness of the craft's acceleration, and the craft's strength against other machines and obstacles): Fire Stingray, Blue Falcon &amp; the Wild GooseBlue Falcon - Piloted by famous bounty hunter Captain Falcon, the Blue Falcon is a well-balanced machine.Golden Fox - Piloted by the former medical doctor Dr. Stewart (known in the instruction manual as Dr. Stuart), the Golden Fox sacrifices both top speed and strength for the quickest acceleration.Wild Goose - Piloted by Pico, a cold-hearted alien ex-soldier, the Wild Goose is stronger and faster than the Blue Falcon but has weaker acceleration.Fire Stingray - Piloted by renegade bounty hunter Samurai Goroh, the Fire Stingray has the fastest top speed and strength, but has very slow acceleration.[CR]Once a player enters a league with a specific machine, they cannot change the machine at any time during the league.[CR]Circuits[CR]The game is split into fifteen circuits, which are split into three separate leagues (Knight for novice racers, Queen for intermediate racers, and King for expert racers). Certain circuits are extensions or slight modifications of a previous circuit (e.g. there are three versions of the track at Mute City)[CR]Players can play seven of the fifteen tracks at any time in Practice Mode, which eliminates disqualification and other F-Zero machines (giving a pure time trial experience).Mute City - A vast glimmering metropolis (and the center of the universe in terms of economic, political, and cultural activity), Mute City hosts the starting circuit in all three leagues (all minor variants of the same simplistic circuit).Big Blue - Built on a tropical planet that is 99% covered with water, Big Blue is the second circuit in the Knight league. A large portion of the track is covered in slippery water.Sand OceanSand Ocean - Built on a planet whose entire surface is covered in sand dunes, Sand Ocean is the third circuit in the Knight league. The track itself contains a lot of narrow hairpin turns which require careful navigation.Death Wind - Built on a dangerous mutated planet haunted by vicious wild storms, Death Wind is the fourth circuit in the Knight league and the second circuit in the King league. The first version consists of a simple, narrow loop (where speed is key). The second version builds upon it with dangerous corners. Both versions include a dangerous wind (pushing the machine in one particular direction) and "dash zones", which sends the machine forward at incredibly-fast speeds.Silence - Built on a purple desolate planet where not a single noise could be heard, Silence is the final circuit in the Knight league. The track itself contains a fair amount of square corners and is one of the few circuits to include landmines.Port TownPort Town - A famous intergalactic trade center and space harbor, Port Town hosts the second circuit in the Queen league and the third circuit in the King league. It is the first circuit to include track-separating gaps (requiring major jumping air) and dangerous magnets (placed on the side of the track). The second version extends the first with narrow turns.Red Canyon - A rocky canyon favored by bandits, Red Canyon is the third circuit in the Queen league and the fourth circuit in the King league. Red Canyon includes dangerous zig-zag areas, landmines, and "down-pull magnets", which pull airborne machines to the ground. The second version builds upon the first by including a dangerous set of turn and a deadly "leap of faith" shortcut.White Land - Built on a popular snow-covered tourist spot, White Land is the fourth and final circuits of the Queen league. Unlike other multi-circuit areas, both versions are completely different. Both tracks are covered in rough snow and dangerous, slippery ice. The first track contains an area with a set of "down-pull magnets", while the second track contains a very wide gap that cannot be traversed with standard-velocity jumps.Fire Field - Set on top of a dangerous sea of magma, Fire Field is the final circuit in the King league (and the final circuit of the game). Consisting of dangerous turns, the track features an area where side-pull magnets are in the middle of the track. It also features a "pit stop" fork in the track, where taking the outer path leads to the power recovery strip (and a dash zone for catching up).Knight LeagueMute City IBig BlueSand OceanDeath Wind ISilenceQueen LeagueMute City IIPort Town IRed Canyon IWhite Land IWhite Land IIKing LeagueMute City IIIDeath Wind IIPort Town IIRed Canyon IIFire FieldPractice ModeMute City IBig BlueSand OceanDeath Wind ISilenceWhite Land IPort Town II[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Have you ever dreamed of being a Formula 1 racer? Have you fantasized about modifying your car to go faster and turn sweeter than any of the others? Have you imagined taking your F1 racer all around the world and becoming the best racer ever? Then look no further, because at least you can play a game where you can do all that, 'cause you know it's never gonna happen in real life. I mean honestly, did you really think it would?[CR]F1 ROC is a fun racing game that lets you customize your racer and make it better than the other cars on the track. The graphics of this game were good for its time, however it's not the best SNES game as far as graphics go. The music is alright however, much like in other racers, the music only plays on the title and menu screens and is silent during gameplay. Despite that this is a fun racer that I highly recommend.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]F-1 ROC is a fun and simple game to play. Start the game by choosing if you want to play Grand Prix or Single race. With Single race you get to choose which track you run, and then you spend a predetermined amount of money modifying you car. You car, however, does not keep its modifications for the next race.[CR]In Grand Prix however, you race on all the tracks from America to Japan and even countries like Portugal. You earn money depending on what place you finish the race in, and with that money add modifications to your car such as a better engine, suspension, tires, and other car parts. Then all you do is get racing and have a blast. So sit down, log in, and have fun.

				<plot>The player must save money in order to enter races and to research better racing equipment. The player must go through the C division, Formula 3000, and eventually to Formula One. In order to accomplish all this, the player must practice really hard and win all the races in a circuit. It all starts out with strange courses, but it eventually leads back to the familiar Formula One courses once the player has won all the Group C and Formula 3000 races. Once the player is in Formula One, he must choose one of three teams. Engines to choose from include Ford, Honda, and Ferrari.[CR]In addition to all this, the player must race all the courses in a certain order and can no longer choose the order in which to do those races. The Formula One portion of the game uses a season standings system in addition to keeping the times of individual races. The object of the game changes from simply winning the races to acquiring as many points as possible in order to win the championship.[CR]Banging up the car, frequently usage of the pit stop, and careless mistakes will destroy championship hopes just like in the real Formula One. Not even cheat codes can guarantee a top ranking in the overall standings, just winning individual races and utilizing strong overtaking moves while preserving the body and tires of the player's chosen vehicle.[CR]Processing Chip:[CR]The game cartridge included a ST010 chip; a chip created by Seta for general functions and handling the intelligence of the computer cars. This chip offered unprecedented realism in the way that computer controlled-cars could perform aggressive manoeuvers with the speed and accuracy of real Formula One drivers. In addition to this, the chip allowed the game's artificial intelligence to perform tricks that were impossible to do with other racing video games released either during or before 1993. Only through the release of the Sony PlayStation and the Nintendo 64 did the level of artificial intelligence in the console system made this special chip obsolete.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Codes[CR]Enter these codes as your name:[CR]SETAUSA Start with $10, 000 Cash[CR]Special[CR]Enter these with controller 2 on the main menu:[CR]X, X, X, X, Y, Y [CR]Access Hidden Game #1[CR]Y, Y, Y, Y, X, X [CR]Access Hidden Game #2[CR]L, R, L, R, L, R, L, R, L, R, R [CR]Sound Test[CR]Up, X, Right, Y, Down, B, Left, A, A [CR]Time Attack Mode[CR]A x 4, B x 14 [CR]Track Select[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_ROC_II:_Race_of_Champions[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]Enter these codes as your name:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]Enter these with controller 2 on the main menu:</plot>

				<title_clean>Faceball 2000</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The November 1991 issue of Nintendo Power where Faceball 2000 was reviewed.[CR]Faceball 2000 is a first-person shooter developed by Xanth Software and published by Bullet Proof Software for the Game Boy on December 10, 1991 and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on September 1992. Based on MIDI Maze for the Atari ST, Bullet Proof Software acquired the console publishing rights to the game and released the game in America, Europe and Japan. Players move around a mazed arena as giant floating happy faces, shooting large orbs at enemies to "tag them out". The game was also published for the Game Gear in Japan on December 17, 1993 by Riverhill Software. The Game Boy and Game Gear versions featured local multiplayer via the use of link cables (up to sixteen players on the Game Boy version and two players on the Game Gear version), while the SNES version featured two-player split-screen multiplayer. The four player link cable, which was only packed in with Nintendo&#8217;s F1-race, was necessary for playing the multiplayer.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]An early level of Cyberzone mode.[CR]The game is a first-person shooter, where the player controls a floating head inside of a giant maze. The goal is to eliminate enemy heads by shooting large orbs.[CR]The game features two normal modes and one hidden mode. The first mode is called Cyberzone, in which players must eliminate a set number of opponents before an exit opens up and they can progress to the next level of increasing difficulties. The second mode is called Arena, in which players can choose from a variety of enemies and stages to play on, with the goal of defeating all the enemies. The final, and hardest mode, is called Cyperscape. Instead of having to eliminate a set number of enemies, Cyberscape is much more maze-focused, not having a map for players like other modes. This mode can only be unlocked by entering a code in the player select screen. All modes can be played with two players.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hiddem Warp Rooms[CR]Start a Game in ''Cyberscape'' mode. On Level 1 (''Find the Exit''), when you see the exit (It's a flashing wall) shoot it 5 times. You'll magically warp to another part of the level with a Speedup Pod, an 9 Extra Lives Pod, and exits to levels 10, 15, 20, and 25. [CR]If you shoot the Nine Lives Pod three times, there will be a key inside. Take it and another part of the room will open, with a Speedup Pod, a Automag Pod, a Level 3 Armor Pod, Warp doors to levels 30, 35, 40, and a Rover enemy. [CR]You'll note that like the Nine Lives Pod before it, the Armor Pod didn't disappear when you took armor from it. Travel around the corner and you should face a dead end. (The exit to level 40 will be at a 90-degree angle to this wall, on the right.) Shoot that wall once, and then touch it. Travel back around the corner to the former Armor Pod, Touch it once, and then shoot it twice to get a key that will open that wall. On the other side are Automag, Speedup and Armor Pods, as well as two Bouncers and warps to levels 60 and 65. [CR]Finally, go near the East wall of this room. (It's near the small ''block'' on your map.) Move slightly to the left of the center, then touch that part of the wall five times, then shoot it once to open the final secret portion of the level. Just inside the Room is a warp to Level 71, but also Two Ninjas, a Guard, a Vampire, and a Kamikaze... [CR]</plot>

The young boy in your family likes to target you for his mischief.  He sets up volleys of tennis balls and lets loose a vacuum cleaner on you which you must avoid.  The cat and other obstacles await you in your house while you collect bones for power.   [CR]After all the trouble you cause in the home, you are sent to Obedience School and you have to run a gauntlet of gung-ho instructors and ferocious Dobermans in the heavily-guarded compound.  If successful at escaping, you reach a forest filled with wild animals.[CR]You can use flips, spins and barks to make your way through the various obstacles.  A special ball when found will trigger a bonus game that will also teach you how to fetch.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Family Feud is an adaptation of the TV game show of the same name, in which two families (five members each) must guess the results of a poll with questions like "What food is commonly eaten at breakfast?". If a team correctly guesses all the answers, or correctly guesses one answer after the other family has given an incorrect answer three times, they win the round.[CR]These particular versions were all published by GameTek for various systems, but were functionally similar. The first game to be published by GameTek was the 1991 version for the NES, which was developed by Beam Software (which has since been rebranded as Krome Studios Melbourne). The SNES and Genesis versions were released in October 1993, developed by Imagineering Inc and Eurocom Entertainment Software respectively. The 3DO version from 1994 was also developed by Eurocom Entertainment Software -- this version used digitized actors and clips from the show.[CR]This Family Feud is not to be confused with the many other games that have had that title, a complete list of which can be found on the Family Feud franchise page.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Fatal Fury</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Fatal Fury (also known as Fatal Fury: King of Fighters, and known in Japan as Legend of the Hungry Wolf: The Battle of Destiny), is a 2D fighting game developed and released by SNK for arcades (using the Neo Geo MVS hardware) and the Neo Geo AES on December 20, 1991.The first fighting game released for the Neo Geo (and the first fighting game developed by SNK), Fatal Fury was designed as a spiritual successor to the original Street Fighter (by its creator, Takashi Nishiyama). Developed around the same time as Street Fighter II (and released a half a year later), Fatal Fury introduced a special "dual line" system (where most stages allow players to fight between the foreground and the background areas). It also introduced the concept of team fights (as a second player joining in must help the first player defeat their opponent before the versus match begins) and mid-match stage changes (changing either the time of day or the weather). The game would later receive numerous sequels throughout the Neo Geo's life cycle.Set in the fictional American city of South Town, Fatal Fury follows American martial artist Terry Bogard, his younger Ninjitsu brother Andy Bogard, and their Japanese Muay Thai kick boxer friend Joe Higashi as they enter the "King of Fighters" tournament (which is not to be confused with the tournaments in the King of Fighters game series) to seek revenge on its sponsor: underworld crime boss Geese Howard.[CR]The game was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (removing the dual line system, team fights, and bonus rounds) and the Genesis (removing two opponents) during 1993, both by Takara. These ports made the other characters playable but removed or changed some of the other features (both versions removing the standard bonus rounds and team fights, the SNES version removing the dual line system, and the Genesis version removing some opponents) Other ports during that era include the Sharp X68000 (on May 21, 1993 for Japan only) and the Neo Geo CD (by SNK on September 9, 1994). The original version was also included in two compilations: Fatal Fury: Battle Archives Volume 1 (for the PlayStation 2) and SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1 (for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and Wii) compilations, and was digitally released for the Wii (via the Virtual Console on September 21, 2007), PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Portable (both via PlayStation Network on December 21, 2010, later made available for the PlayStation Vita).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Fatal Fury plays like a traditional fighting game. The player has three attack buttons: Punch, Kick, and Throw. Each character have special moves whose input commands are shown during the course of the game (after every bonus round) as opposed to being given in an instruction card in the game's cabinet.The game introduced a unique and novel fighting game concept to the franchise: that fighters can fight on two different areas (known as "lines" or "planes") instead of just one. This allows characters to dodge attacks and projectiles completely rather than block them. While this was heavily expanded in later games, this game does not allow the player character to freely move among the lines. Instead, the player character can knock the opponent to the other area and follow up with a quick roll or a jump kick. Some stages have only one area, with the other area blocked off by obstacles (in which knocking the opponent into the obstacles bounce them back to the main area).After every two matches, the player is allowed to participate in a bonus round in which they arm wrestle a machine by mashing the Punch button as fast as possible.Fatal Fury is the only fighting game in the series where if a second player joins in the middle of a fight, the fight is not interrupted so that the two players could battle. Instead, before the actual versus battle takes place, both players fight the CPU opponent in a two-on-one fight.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Despite there being 11 total fighters in this fighting game, only three are playable in the arcade version. The other fighters are only playable on the SNES and Genesis ports in their Versus Modes only (although the SNES version only allowed the second player to play as the other players).Hwa Jai and Billy Kane are not included as fighters in the Genesis port. Instead, the matches against the second and fourth initial opponents in the campaign are first "interrupted" with match against one of the other remaining protagonists.Playable CharactersTerry BogardAndy BogardJoe HigashiCPU Opponents[CR]After initially choosing one of the three protagonists, players must then choose their first opponent to fight:Duck KingRichard MeyerMichael MaxTung Fu Rue[CR]Defeating their first opponent then cycles them through the other three initial fighters.

				<title_clean>Fatal Fury 2</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Fatal Fury 2 (known in Japan as Legend of the Hungry Wolf 2: The New Battle) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by SNK for arcades (using the Neo Geo MVS hardware) and the Neo Geo AES on March 5, 1993.The second installment of the Fatal Fury series, Fatal Fury 2 heavily improves the fighting mechanics of the original (including a traditional control layout with four basic attack buttons, the ability to move freely between fighting areas with special commands, and a less restricted character roster) while introducing some mechanics from Art of Fighting (including dashing and powerful situational super moves). A major update to the game, titled Fatal Fury Special, was released later in the year.Set after the death of crime boss Geese Howard in the original Fatal Fury, a new worldwide "King of Fighters" tournament is held by mysterious German nobleman Wolfgang Krauser seeking the fighter responsible for the defeat. Along with the three original protagonists (Terry Bogard, Andy Bogard, and Joe Higashi), players can pick one of five new fighters to progress through the tournament, including Japanese ninja Mai Shiranui, Korean taekwondo master Kim Kaphwan, and Australian wrestler Big Bear (formerly Raiden from the previous game).Along with the standard Neo Geo CD port (by SNK on September 9, 1994), the game received a worldwide port to both the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Genesis in 1994 by TAKARA. Japan-exclusive ports were also released for the Sharp X68000, PC Engine CD-ROM&#178; (requiring the Arcade Card add-on), and Game Boy (where all characters are redone in a "super deformed" style). The original Neo Geo version was also included in the Fatal Fury Battle Archives Volume 1 compilation for the PlayStation 2 and was digitally released for the Wii (via the Wii Virtual Console) on June 30, 2008. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Neo Geo's Four Button Configuration Unlike the previous game, Fatal Fury 2 now makes full use of the Neo Geo's four-button configuration by removing the dedicated throw button and separating the Punch and Kick buttons to Light and Strong. Throws are now performed by holding forwards or backwards on the joystick while both fighters are close and pressing Strong Punch.New techniques to the series include dashing backwards (by tapping backwards on the joystick twice), crouch walking forwards (by holding down+forward on the joystick), and taunting (by pressing Strong Punch from afar). Also new are "Defensive Attacks", which allows players to counter-attack a whiffed attack by holding forward and pressing Light Punch while blocking, and "Desperation Attacks", powerful super moves that can only be executed when the player's life gauge is nearly depleted (as indicated by a flashing red life gauge).The "dual line" fighting system from the original Fatal Fury also applies to the game. However, players can now move freely among lines. When both players are in the same line, pressing both Light Punch and Light Kick simultaneously lets the player jump to the opposite line. From there, either player can follow up by performing a special attack (by pressing either Punch or Kick button with certain joystick combinations) or by rolling harmlessly (by pressing either Up or Down on the joystick). Players can also knock other players into the opposite line with a "Strong Attack" (by pressing both Strong Punch and Strong Kick simultaneously). Only the first three boss characters have "one-line" stages with obstacles.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Fatal Fury 2 contains eight playable characters and four CPU-only boss characters, which can only be playable in the SNES, Genesis, and Game Boy versions with a cheat code. Much like the Street fighter 2, Fatal Fury 2 made a point of picking fighters from around the world, selecting many different nations for fighters to represent. Fatal Fury 2 was notable for introducing popular characters Mai Shiranui, and Kim Kapwhan. These characters would go on to become regulars in the popular King of Fighters Series.CharacterNationalityList of Special MovesStageTerry Bogard AmericanPower WaveBurn KnuckleRising TackleCrack ShootPower Geyser* Andy BogardAmericanShadow SliceRising Dragon PunchSonic SplitFlying CrunchChoReppadan* Joe HigashiJapaneseSlash KickTNT PunchTiger KickHurricane UpperScrew Upper* Mai ShiranuiJapaneseCherry DreamDragon Flame FandangoDeadly Ninja BeesButterfly FanSquirrel AttackCho Hisatsu Shinobibachi* Kim KaphwanSouth KoreanFlying SliceMoon Cresent SlashFlying KickHouou Kyaku*Big Bear AustraliaGiant BombSuper Drop KickFire Breath* Jubei YamadaJapaneseNihon Seoi DashBody DropCookie CutterDynamite Izuna OtoshiCheng Sinzan TaiwanTempest BlastBelly BlastBone Crusher blastBakuri Hoh*[CR]Unplayable Boss Character[CR]In the MVS version of Fatal Fury 2 the boss characters are unplayable.

				<plot>The game that started the best-selling series licensed by football's world governing body, this first installment in the long running series used a dimetric (colloquially known as "isometric") viewpoint, previously unusual in football games but quickly imitated by several titles. The televisual presentation, one of the unique points of the early EA Sports titles, with hosts introducing the matches, was another thing making the game stand out from a market dominated by Sensible Soccer and Kick Off games.[CR]Based on international teams (with fictional player names), their abilities in each skill area rated out of 10 to give the player an overall impression of how good they are. The options available follow the standard set: fouls and offsides can be toggled on and off, the match length can be set, and if the timer operates  continuously, or only while the ball is in play. Gameplay privileges quick runs, short passes and blistering shots outside the penalty box, and set pieces are controlled by moving a box into the target area for the ball, and then passed, lobbed or kicked directly. On the tactical side, formations can be selected, with 5 different strategies also available (although not all of these combinations make sense) as can the team Coverage - the areas which defenders, midfielders and strikers cover.</plot>

				<plot>"Aiming to be the first football simulation that is realistic in the true sense of the word, FIFA Soccer 96 was extremely popular at the time of release. It was hailed as the first really successful FIFA release, and opened the way for yearly revisions of the concept.[CR]There were a number of factors that made FIFA96 stand out from the crowd of other football sims. Firstly, the game's commentary was revolutionary at the time -- the renowned British commentator John Motson comments all the incidents and happenings on the pitch in real-time. The ambient commentary is varied, and systems with more than the minimum memory level get extra commentary phrases.[CR]The Virtual Stadium technology has numerous pre-defined camera angles. The game even has a SVGA mode for better-than-minimum system[CR]FIFA96 boasts eleven leagues from all around the world, ranging from the unknown players of the Malaysian league to the celebrated stars of the English and Italian leagues. 59 International teams are also featured, and it's possible to match the teams you want to against each other through friendlies, or you can also choose to play domestic tournaments or International ones such as the World Cup. If you're not satisfied with the composition of the various teams, you can create your own dream team through the custom team creator.</plot>

				<title_clean>Fighter's History</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Fighter's History is a fighting game developed and released by  Data East for the arcades in 1993. The game featured basic, smooth gameplay mechanics and the standard six-button control scheme made famous by  Street Fighter II. (Things that other fighting games at the time did not implement well.) The game topped the Japanese arcade charts at the time, causing  Capcom to take notice and bring Data East to court. Despite the rest of the world shunning the game over its similarities to Street Fighter II, it was ported to the  Super Nintendo worldwide a year later, adding features such as a Turbo speed setting and the ability to play as the two boss characters. The game also spawned two sequels:  Karnov's Revenge for the  Neo Geo in 1994 and Fighter's History: Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu for the Super Nintendo in Japan in 1995.[CR]One of the main features of this game is that in order to dizzy an opponent, the player must attack the opponent's weak position (which differs per character and can be head, chest, or legs). Clothing representing the weak position glow as it's attacked until it breaks, dizzying the opponent. Lawsuit[CR]Coincidentally, Data East USA has been in court involving a fighting game in the 1980s, claiming that  Epyx licensed and distributed  World Karate Championship (better known as International Karate), which they believe infringed on their fighting game (Karate Champ). The game names were similar, combatants wore white and red outfits, referees looked the same in-game, the moves were similar, and the scoring mechanisms were the same. However, the court judged that these similarities encompassed "the idea of karate" (they were the elements of a karate video game) and was not protected by copyright. Due to this, Data East lost the case.[CR]Capcom USA attempted to sue Data East USA in 1994 with similar claims, claiming that Fighter's History infringed on  Street Fighter II. Capcom identified the similarities into four categories: representation of the playable characters, representation of the special moves, control sequences for the special moves, and miscellaneous (such as "V.S." screens, attract mode, and tracking a player's vitality). The court ruled that the miscellaneous similarities were commonplace and not protected by copyright (in a similar vein to the previous Data East lawsuit). The court also ruled that while the control sequences for the special moves were similar, they were not a form of expression protected by copyright. As for the representation of the playable characters and special moves, the court found three characters (Matlok, Feilin, and Ray) and five special moves in Fighter's History were similar but not virtually identical to characters and moves found in Street Fighter II. Because of this analysis, Capcom lost the case.[CR]This case marks a decline of Capcom's close grip of the fighting game genre, as it provoked other fighting games to be less restrictive in terms of emulating the mechanics of what is known as the "traditional fighting game".[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Ray McDougal (USA) Makoto Mizoguchi (Japan)Liu Feilin (China)Ryoko Kano (Japan)Matlock Jade (UK)Samchay Tomyamgun (Thailand)Lee Diendou (China)Jean Pierre (France)Marstorius (Italy)Clown (France) (boss) Karnov (Russia) (boss)[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Final Fantasy - Mystic Quest</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Chopping down a tree.[CR]Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was released on October 5, 1992 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in the US. The game was touted as a simplified role-playing game for entry level players. This was done to appeal to people not familiar with the role playing genre, so they could then "graduate" to Squaresoft's other RPGs like Final Fantasy IV or the then-upcoming Secret of Mana. The game was eventually released in its native Japan the following year with the title Final Fantasy USA: Mystic Quest.[CR]The game begins with the player controlling a young adult named Benjamin during an adventure to reclaim stolen crystals that represented the world's elemental powers. Unlike most of the Squaresoft RPGs of the time, there are no save points; players are allowed to save at any time. Party size is limited to two with Benjamin and a secondary character slot that rotates as the story progresses. In place of random battles, the player is able to see enemies on the field without the need of an item until a specific point in the game, but all enemies are stationary and incapable of roaming. Also unlike most RPGs, players are not allowed to free roam the world map, making the gameplay mostly linear. The player is required to follow guided paths, some of which could be blocked off until tasks are completed. Characters can jump, and use weapons outside of battle lending it an action-adventure type of gameplay also not found in other Final Fantasies. Mystic Quest includes many puzzles during the gameplay. Mystic Quest does not have the tradition of random enemies like the rest of the Final Fantasy franchise, instead the player battles stationary enemies within dungeons. The player has the choice whether to attack the enemy or not, and can prepare beforehand with restorative items. The battle screen appears after approaching an enemy, turns are awarded back and forth with the fastest character getting the most turns. Players can battle, run, or "control" during the battle menu. Control can allow the player to manually control their allies or have the CPU control them. Battle is influenced by statistics like speed, accuracy, or attacking power. Characters gain experience points and gold pieces from winning battles. The game also includes battlefields that the player can enter and attempt to clear out ten battles against pre-set enemy encounters which rewards the player with a large cash prize or even a unique item.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR] Soundtrack cover [CR]The Soundtrack for Final Fantasy Mystic Quest was composed by Yasuhiro Kawakami and Ryuji Sasai.[CR]01 - MYSTIC RE-QUEST I[CR]02 - MYSTIC RE-QUEST II[CR]03 - Mystic Quest[CR]04 - Hill of Fate[CR]05 - World[CR]06 - Beautiful Forest[CR]07 - Battle 1[CR]08 - Victory Fanfare[CR]09 - City of Forest[CR]10 - Fossil Labyrinth[CR]11 - Battle 2[CR]12 - Middle Tower[CR]13 - Shrine of Light[CR]14 - Rock Theme[CR]15 - Fanfare of Friendship[CR]16 - Dungeon of Ice[CR]17 - Dungeon of Waterfall[CR]18 - City of Fire - Faeria[CR]19 - Rock 'n' Roll[CR]20 - Lava Dome[CR]21 - City of Wind - Windaria[CR]22 - Mountain Range of Whirlwinds[CR]23 - The Crystal[CR]24 - Last Castle[CR]25 - Battle 3[CR]26 - Mystic Ballad[CR]27 - Ending[CR]28 - RE-MIXTIC QUEST[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Battlefield Reset[CR]When fighting in a battlefield against an enemy that can selfdestruct, make sure all but that one enemy is dead. Also, make sure your hp is low enough for the selfdestruct to kill you as well. Wait for the enemy to selfdestruct and kill both of you. The battle will end, you will gain all the experience, gp, and even the battle count will decrease, and then it will ask you to try again. Do so and repeat the previous steps until you see that you have won the prize for defeating all the enemies. Win the next battle and exit. The battlefield icon will look like one that has been cleared out and the battlefield will now say: Battlefield Round 255 of 10.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Battlefield Reset[CR]In the menu screen, press START and SELECT at the same time.  You should then get a box telling you which version number all the chips in your SNES are.  Afterwards, the text in the menu screens might act a bit wacky.  Just exit the menu and enter it again to fix it. [CR]Weird little trick for Square to put in the game, eh?[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Battlefield Reset[CR]Usable with any battlefield that gives Experience points as a reward.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Battlefield Reset[CR]Fight in the battlefield until you have one battle left. Then, go anywhere else, and fight enemies until your experience needed for the next level is within the range that the battlefield gives. (i.e. If the battlefield gives around 200 exp. per battle, get your needed exp. to within 200.)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Battlefield Reset[CR]Then, go back and finish the battlefield. You will gain the level with the exp. gain from the enemies, get the exp. reward, then gain another level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Battlefield Reset[CR]This glitch will completely skip getting the fire crystal and/or getting Reuben for the first time.To start, you need your items to be in this order for consumables, Seeds, Cure Potion, Refresher and Heal Potion last. Best way to get this order set up is to get the Seed in Bone Dungeon, getting the Cure Potion right after killing the Flamerus Rex. Get the Refresher in the Ice Pyramid's first room, waiting to get the Heal Potion in the room where you get the second chest armor (It's the right chest of the bottom two.) Okay, now once you beat the Ice Golem, get the coin and make way to Fireburg and go into the Hotel.Use up the last of your seeds so none are left and talk to the npc behind the counter on the right, they sell seeds, set it to buy 0 (ZERO) seeds and accept, open your menu and you'll see the zero seeds, use one and you'll see your Cure Potions turn into the Sun Coin, the final coin to get through Doom Castle.Okay, next thing we'll want to do is talk to the person sitting at the table just to the left and up a bit, they're selling Cure Potions, you want to buy 19 and then open your menu again, actually look at your items, you'll see you've lost both coins you've collected at this point from the first two dungeons, but now, where they were, you now have the last two coins.All you have to do from here is leave fireburg, go back to the focus tower, and enter the next area.Reuben will still pop out of your ass for the little scene at the bridge, but...eh, broken game is broken.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Battlefield Reset[CR]On American versions of Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest, there is a particular glitch regarding the Life spell. Like in most Final Fantasies (and the EU/JP versions of this game), it is intended to be able to do extreme damage to undead enemies. However, a few flags got mixed up in the US versions of the game: in this version, you can use Life to kill non-undead enemies, although you can't damage undead enemies at all with this spell.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Battlefield Reset[CR]When you lose a partner and gain a new one, the new partner will retain resistances from your previous partner if you never turned off the game in between.  Stats are also affected, but do not remain exactly like the previous partner.The new partner will continue to have the incorrect stats and resistances until you restart the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Defeating Doom King Easily[CR]Once the battle with Doom King has begun, cast Cure on him, and you'll do massive damage to the boss. You'll do about  10,000+ to him. That's an easy win against the final boss, dont you think?[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Defeating Doom King Easily[CR]Go to any town, and if you find a treasure box, open it. Go out of town, then go back in. Open the box again and the item will be available. This can be of great help when you are stocking 99 of each item. </plot>

				<title_clean>Final Fantasy II</title_clean>
				<plot>This is the fourth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was known as Final Fantasy II internationally, because the  second and third games were never released outside of Japan.[CR]The military country of Baron is one of the strongest in the land, with a proud army and a majestic air force known as the Red Wings. But, while their armies are kind and loyal, the recent actions of the King are anything but. The young Captain of the Red Wings, Cecil, is ordered to steal a crystal from a village of innocent magicians, and when he questions the actions of his King, Cecil is immediately thrown out of the country and sent off to kill strange monsters. Little does he realize the price the King's actions will pay, and what the true secret of the crystals, and their powers, truly is...[CR]This is the first Final Fantasy game that introduced the famous ATB (active-time battle) system: during the battles, you have a time indicator for each party member that tells you when this character is able to act. If it takes you too long to select a command for this character, the enemy will act without waiting for your turn. The game abandons the job system that was implemented in the  first and the  third game in favor of pre-set character classes (paladin, white mage, ninja, etc.) assigned to each party member.[CR]The PlayStation version adds a new rendered intro and ending.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 250 of a weapon![CR]OK, this glitch is a way to get 250-255 of a weapon. However, make sure you follow my directions EXACTLY how I say to, or else the trick will not work. [CR]To start the trick, you need the Avenger sword, which you can find in the Sylvan cave in the underground, I think. [CR]First, equip Cecil with arrows in his GOOD hand, and the any kind of bow in his BAD. Get into a battle (preferably an easy one), and make sure that nobody does anything. If a character's turn comes before his, have them parry (press right and the parry option will come up). Once it gets to Cecil's turn, enter the item screen. Grab the arrows he has equiped and bring them down to an empty slot. Without leaving the window, select the Avenger sword and move it up to his BAD hand. [CR]From there, press B to exit the items window and his commands will disappear because the Avenger sword causes the person with it equiped to be berserked. Don't have any other characters do ANYTHING! Just let Cecil beat up all the enemies. [CR]After the battle, go to the Equip screen for Cecil. Move the Avenger sword to an empty slot, and then without leaving the screen move the sword you would like to duplicate 250 times into his GOOD hand (the one with the numbers). De-equip, and re-equip, and voila! You should have a sword with a circle and a number next to it in your inventory. If not, make sure you followed my directions EXACTLY. [CR]This works well for duplicating the excalibur, and having Edge throw it for massive damage. Happy gaming![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 250 of a weapon![CR]This has to be done right after the battle with Golbez in the underworld, right after the battle you get Rydia back. You cast Warp and you return to the Crystal Room with the Crystal returned. Doing this makes you completely eliminate the quest of the Sealed Cave.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 250 of a weapon![CR]Once you have the Sylph spell, simply arrange Rydias spell list so that Sylph is in the top-right corner. Whenever you cast the spell, Rydia will not lose any MP. Note, though, that if Rydia does not have at least 25 MP (the normal casting cost), you will not be able to select the spell for casting.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 250 of a weapon![CR]Unlike the duplicate weapon trick, this glitch DOES NOT work in the PlayStation re-release (Final Fantasy Chronicles).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 250 of a weapon![CR]The Mage and Bomb summon spells are very random to achive after a battle with either a bomb or mage.  Hunting them down can very time consuming especially with a low encounter rate.  A good way to enhance the chances of receiving it is with multiple kills in only one battle.  You will need a lot of phoenix downs for this.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 250 of a weapon![CR]In a battle with either a mage or bomb (there must at least be two), memorize the party's attack order.  With one member, select to kill the enemy.  The next party member should IMMEDIATELY select a phoenix down and place it on the enemy.  The result will be the enemy is killed and then resurrected by the next party member.   You may repeat this for as many phoenix downs as you have, then finish the battle.  The amount of treasure you earn will be a lot greater, and you will most likely earn a bomb or mage spell in the process.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 250 of a weapon![CR]I'm sure most of you remember that if you use weapons, armor, or accessories made out of any metal or any silver in the Dark Elf's cave.  However, there's a little glitch that can be exploited if you don't feel like using wooden gear or your bare hands to fight.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 250 of a weapon![CR]Simply put, make sure all metallic/silver equipment is unequipped before the start of any random battle.  Then when you get into battle, equip your metal weaponry(and shields, if you want) and you won't be paralyzed for that battle!  Just remember to unequip the items after the battle and before the next battle and you can dominate your way through the Dark Elf's cave!  As far as I know, this works in the Playstation and WonderSwan re-releases, too, but I know for a fact it works in the original FFII and FFIV carts.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Item Duplication[CR]Firsly make sure you have the item you want to duplicate, and enter a battle and select the item option of the person with the item you wish to duplicate. Then Scroll down to a blank space on the item list and press A to place a glove there, scroll back up to the equipped items then press A on the one you'll be duplicating, then press B to leave the screen.  [CR]Next, hold the L and R buttons to run from the battle, press X to see the subscreen, select Equip and the character who has the item, press A on empty spot the item used to occupy, then press A on the actual item that's now in the items list. You will now see that your character has two of the selected item equipped.</plot>

				<title_clean>Final Fantasy III</title_clean>
				<plot>This is the sixth entry in the  Final Fantasy series. It was called Final Fantasy III because three of the five previous installments of the series were never released outside of Japan.[CR]1,000 years ago, the War of the Magi occurred. People remember it as one of the most horrible tragedies in history. Since the War of the Magi, magic has been all but forgotten, technology began to grow, and people returned to seemingly normal lives. The only true worry people had was the Empire, whose leaders were looking to revive the great force once known as "magic".[CR]But then...something happened that would change the course of history forever...[CR]The Empire had heard word of the remains of a mystical being, known as an "Esper", being found in the mining town of Narshe. Quickly, three soldiers were dispatched to find this Esper and bring it to the Emperor. One of the soldiers, a young girl, triggers a power in the Esper that will begin one of the most dangerous series of events ever. And the only ones who can help her are a rag-tag band of rebels and heroes, whose very hearts and souls are the only ones that can save the world from the mad plans of the Empire.[CR]The game maintains the ATB (active time battle) system of the two previous  Final Fantasy games, spicing classic turn-based combat engine with a real-time element. The customization system combines character-specific classes with free-flowing character development. By finding various Espers and equipping them on characters, you can improve their parameters in different ways and choose the magic spells you want to learn for each character.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]The 0 HP Character Glitch provides a means by which a character can achieve 0 HP, but still remain alive according to the game and thereby also be invulnerable (as KO'ed characters cannot be targeted or harmed). This will last until the character is healed by some means, such as a Potion or Cure in the field. There are several ways in which to do this.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]The most feasible method of doing so requires the use of Doom and Jump. When a character afflicted by Doom has Jump, have them use Jump as their Doom counter nears zero. If the counter reaches zero while the character is in the air, and after that point but before the execution of the actual Jump attack the battle ends, then the character will be invulnerable.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]Another feasible method requires the use of the Zombie and Petrified statuses and cures for these. When a party member is Zombified, they should then be Petrified. Then you should cure their Zombification through a Holy Water and their Petrification through any desired means. This will also induce the glitch.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]This glitch will allow you to obtain the Blackjack at an early point in the game, should you so desire. To execute this glitch, you must first save the game in the overworld at the first possible opportunity: this point (which can be shifted, but is ideally done early) is the point in the game where you'll have the Blackjack. From this point on, you must play the game without saving until you reach the Floating Continent: at this point, you must travel along it until you can get onto the Blackjack. Get on it and fly around for a while in it without landing - 10 minutes is sufficient - and then return to the Floating Continent. There, get a Game Over.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]You will then restart gameplay from the point of the initial save, with one key change: you are aboard the Blackjack! Several features will be restricted to you, such as entering the interior and re-entering the airship after landing it. This has a number of benefits despite this. For example, you can fly to an area in the game to skip all events up to that point (Zozo being the latest allowed). You can also bring temporary characters - such as Leo or Banon - to other, early points in the game by flying.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]Put Gau and Relm in the same party.  Have Gau jump on an opponent.  Fight until he comes back, but before he does his little speech, have Relm sketch him. If your game is glitchable, then there is a chance at switched up character sprites and/or many items added to inventory after the battle.  I recieved 255 MagicBoxes and 255 Atmas Weapons this way the 5th time I did it.  (Note this only works on the early carts.  Will not work on all carts.)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]Equip Celes with a Cursed Shield. If she absorbs (with runic)a spell the shield makes her weak against (fire is what i used) she gets back double the mp of the spell.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]When fighting the Wrexsoul in Cyan's dreams at Doma in the World of Ruin, there is a glitch involving his Gi Nattak attack. In this attack, the Wrexsoul will possess one of your four characters for a time until he kills them. If, in that time, you defeat all of the enemies allying him, you will automatically win the battle despite not having killed Wrexsoul himself. (Note: You will not gain any of the rewards normally associated with Wrexsoul's defeat.)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]To execute this glitch, you must put Reraise on an undead enemy: this can be done through Rippler to trade Reraise from someone, at least most reliably. Then you must use  an instant-death attack or spell on the same foe: the foe will die, then return to life, and then die again because Reraise auto-revived it and Life is Death for the undead. This causes the game to consider that the foe was killed twice, doubling the received rewards.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]To begin with, sell everything that the intended character you wish to put something on can equip. Next, put the desired "equip anything" item in the final bottom-rightmost slot of the items menu, slot #256. This item can be literally ANYTHING you want, even things that cannot be equipped, such as the Drill item. After doing this, press Optimize and the item will stay there and can be equipped by the person with no equipment in any particular area of their equipment. For example, the aforementioned Drill can be taken on as a helmet. Depending on the item, a huge variety of stat changes can occur: once again, the Drill actually makes your Defense and Magic Defense go to 255, meaning almost every attack only deals 1 damage![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]Normally, two pieces of equipment - the Force Shield and Cursed Shield - are supposed to grant status ailments in battle. The Cursed Shield is the one you'll want to most use with this glitch, since it only grants bad ailments, whereas the Force Shield grants the positive one in Shell. If you equip the Cursed Shield in the middle of battle - not before, DURING - you will instead be granted immunity to all of the ailments it gives, which is most of the ailments in the game![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]On all versions of the SNES cartridge, the evade% stat has no effect.  [CR]All algorithms use MBlock% to calculate dodging/blocking an attack, magical or physical. [CR]128% is where MBlock% is maxed at effectiveness (higher isn't worse, it just isn't any more effective) [CR]Therefore, equip your characters to 128 MBlock% or higher and you'll be nearly invincible (block or dodge any unblockable attack.)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]Let us assume you have a tile you wish to bypass: this tile can be a tile which triggers an event - such as a boss - or you simply a wall you wish to walk through. If you open the menu and quickly press the direction in which you desire to move as it loads, you can walk in the direction chosen,  but the game's hit detection will fail, allowing you to walk into and through walls with repeated use and to also bypass various event battles.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]The most famous instance of this glitch is known to many fans as the "Moghan glitch", in which Locke is able to bypass the guards in South Figaro and head to South Figaro Cave without Celes and in turn instead have Moghan. However, this glitch is also abusable in a number of other instances.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]When you have Vanish and Relm, go into battle, have one other character cast vanish on a desired opponent then have Relm Sketch that opponent and QUICKLY run away, check your items and voila! *Note, may not work on all carts. 1/1000 chance of freezing the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]Normally, Jump is only intended to double the damage earned from spear-class weapons; however, this can be extended to any weapon so long as the wielder can hold two weapons. If you equip two weapons, one of whom is a spear, the second weapon's damage also is doubled by Jump. Other exploits can be derived from Jump's accumulation of active weapons' properties; for example, if someone uses Mug while someone is Jumping, all Jumps from there on will also have the effects of Mug.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]Typically during a pincer battle - a battle in which enemies are on both sides of the party - there is supposed to be only one singular row, rather than the front and back row. Despite this, you can still select the Row option in battle: everyone will initially be in the front row, and now in the back row, quickly halving the damage each take, even though there was no true position change.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]To prevent Organyx from breaking, you can put it in a character's right hand, then also equip them with the Dragoon Boots but without the Dragon Horn. The sword will now never break because it was encoded improperly for this situation, where it is meant to check the left hand here.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]In a battle, have Cyan use Retort, then cast Imp on him. Then use an attack that kills him without triggering Retort, such as magic, or killing him in one hit. Now revive him and use the Fight command with anyone. Cyan will counterattack every move that is made, including his own. In other words, Cyan will attack his enemies over and over again, uninterrupted, until they are all dead.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]First start by getting one of your groups onto a save point.  Now cycle through the groups until you arrive back at the one on the save point.  Switch groups one more time and go to the party screen and the "Save" command should be useable (and you can even use Tents!).  Even after walking around and getting into a battle, the Save command should still be available.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Level Ups[CR]Note: you must have a turbo controller to do this trick[CR]&lt;br/&gt;When you make it to the Lete River, set your window commands to "Short" and switch Banon's "Health" and "Attack" then switch the commands back to "Window" so you can have Banon's Health as the default command.  When you get to a point where you have a choice of going "Straight" or Left set your controller to turbo and tape down the A button.  Leave your game on overnight and you will likely be around level 50-60.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Level Ups[CR]First you need the Vanish spell and the Doom spell. (X-Zone could also work) Cast Vanish on the enemy and then cast Doom on the vanished target. This also works on about 95% of bosses![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Level Ups[CR]As the world is collapsing on the Floating Continent, and you have six minutes to get off, make your way to the very end where you can jump down to the airship. Instead of jumping, wait and do not move. When there is five seconds left on the clock Shadow will appear and jump down to the airship with you instead of dying. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Level Ups[CR]When you're supposed to catch some fish for Cid, be sure to catch the fast ones that moves around in the water and give those to Cid so he can live. If you catch the slow ones and feed them to Cid, he'll die because the slow ones are the sick fish and the fast ones are the healthy ones.</plot>

				<title_clean>Final Fight</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]CPS arcade version[CR]Final Fight first appeared as a 1989 arcade game released by Capcom for their CPS hardware. It is a side-scrolling beat-em up with attacks consisting mainly of simple punching and kicking, as well as grabs, throws, aerial attacks and special moves which clear the area around the player while draining a small amount of health. Knives, swords and pipes can also be used. In the original arcade release, there are three playable characters: Cody, Haggar , and Guy.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Damnd Taunting Hagger[CR]The story revolves around a street gang known as Mad Gear kidnapping Jessica, who is Haggar's daughter and Cody's girlfriend. Instead of giving in to the gang, Haggar, Cody, and Cody's training partner, Guy, take to the streets of Metro City to destroy the gang and rescue Jessica. The player fights through the streets, through the subway system, through a wrestling ring, and eventually fight all the way the leader of the Mad Gear gang's mansion. The final boss is the leader of the Mad Gear gang on a wheelchair with Jessica on his lap rolling around and shooting the heroes with a crossbow. The trio eventually beat him out of his chair and kick him through the large window he is standing next to.[CR]Hardware[CR]An original Final Fight arcade machine[CR]Final Fight was originally on Capcom's CPS arcade hardware. It featured a dedicated cabinet with a control panel that had two buttons and a 8-way joystick. Although three characters where selectable only two player could play at a single cabinet. Cabinet Colors varied but where typically black, with large character graphics where featured on the side.[CR]Ports Sequels and Emulation[CR]The SNES version of Final Fight[CR]The SNES version, released in North America in 1991, disappointed many because it dropped the co-op play, removing arguably the most attractive element of the game and it also removes Guy as a playable character. Though a second version was later released in 1994, called Final Fight: Guy, where Guy was a playable character and Cody was not. This version was available as a rental-only game from Blockbuster video stores.[CR]It was recently discovered that two variations of Final Fight: Guy exist- the common "orange box", and the rarer "black box." There is a lot of confusion as to where these black box version came from, and very few have ever been found. Theories express that it could have been the original color of the box until an exclusive deal was later made with Blockbuster or that it was a Canadian variant, despite it being marked as available in the US. This small variation can make these versions of the game very valuable from a collector's standpoint.[CR]Two sequels, Final Fight 2 and Final Fight 3, were released on the SNES in 1993 and 1995, respectively.[CR]The game was re-released on the Game Boy Advance as Final Fight One. Final Fight: One featured small dialog exchanges before boss fights, unlockable features, and the Street Fighter: Alpha versions of Cody ,and Guy.[CR]Final Fight: Double Impact was a PSN and XBLA game that was attached with Magic Sword.[CR]The game was also released as part of the 'Capcom Arcade' on iOS ( iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad) in 2011.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]Haggar[CR]The big slow strong character of Final Fight. His optimal weapon is the pipe, and has a piledriver and spinning lariat. He is the mayor of Metro City as well as Jessica's Father.Cody[CR]The middle of the road character of Final Fight. His optimal weapon is the knife, he is the only character able to use the knife without throwing it. He uses a jumping spin kick, and is Jessica's boyfriend.Guy[CR]The fast character of Final Fight. His optimal weapon is the Katana. He uses a jumping spin kick similar to Cody's. Guy is a friend of Cody's[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Metro City as it appears in Final Fight (CPS arcade version)[CR]There are six stages in the first Final Fight all taking place in Metro City.Stage one - SlumStage two - SubwayStage three - West SideStage four - Industrial AreaStage Five - Bay AreaStage six - Up Town[CR]Bonus Stages:The first bonus stage takes place in a gas station in between level two and three, where the player destroys a thugs car as fast as they can within the time limit.The glass panes factory is the second bonus stage, it takes place between level five and six, where the player is to destroy all of the glass panes in the factory within the time limit.[CR]Boss Characters[CR]Damnd[CR]Damnd is the first level boss, as well as the character that Haggar talks to in the attract screen.[CR]*In the SNES version his name was changed to Thrasher.Sodom[CR]Sodom is the Second level boss. He uses two swords that can be knocked out of his hands and used against him. He would later appear as a playable character in Street Fighter Apha.[CR]*In some regions he is known as Katana.Edi.E[CR]Edi.E is the third stage boss. The gum he spits out at the start of the fight can be eaten to regain health.Rolento[CR]The boss of the fouth stage. He is fought on a elevator while enemies and weapons fall down from above.Abigail[CR]Abigail is the boss of the fifth stage. He appears to be a palette swap of Andore with a different head.Belger[CR]Horace Belger is the sixth and final boss. He starts in a electric wheelchair with Jessica in his lap. The chair breaks after a significant amount of damage or a single throw, and Jessica is tossed aside.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bonus credits[CR]If the player initials entered for the top 3 high scores are CAP, COM, GUY and in that order, you will begin a new game with 5 credits instead of 3.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bonus credits[CR]Hold L+R and press the Start button at the title screen.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Final Fight 2 is the sequel to the 1989 arcade beat-em-up,  Final Fight. Released by  Capcom for the  Super Nintendo in 1993. The game features Mike Haggar as the returning character from the original.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR] Haggar, piledrives his way to victory.[CR]After the fall of the Mad Gear gang in the original game, two of the original heroes, Cody and Guy, go their separate ways.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super SWIV is the sequel to Silkworm and SWIV, both of which were originally Amiga games. It is known as Firepower 2000 in the US. As was the case with its predecessors, Super SWIV is a top-down vertical-scrolling shoot 'em up that focuses on a helicopter rather than a spaceship or a plane.[CR]The game supports 1 to 2 players, whereby Player One would control the Helicopter, whilst Player Two could control the Jeep, or vice versa. The Helicopter is capable of flying over obstacles so by picking the Jeep the player had a large disadvantage and could often get stuck on a building and subsequently die, due to the screen constantly moving upwards. To compensate, the Jeep is capable of firing in many directions.[CR]It was also released on the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis under a different title: Mega SWIV, albeit with reduced quality audio and graphics. A different level design is incorporated into the Mega Drive version, but the general premise is the same.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]During the game, pause and press the following buttons on the appropriate stage to skip ahead one stage:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Power Up[CR]At the beginning of Level 1, steer to the far right to find a yellow container.

				<plot>A long time ago the kingdoms of wind, fire, earth and water[CR]competed for the Trialight, a weapon created by the Arch Mage Wylde that can only be used by a Firestriker. The kingdom of wind won and united the four kingdoms. Wylde however, was not satisfied with peace and conjured four monsters to overthrow the united world. Now, only the kingdom of wind remains and the player takes control over the last Firestriker to free the other kingdoms and defeat the monsters.[CR]Even though Firestriker looks like a typical SNES RPG, it is in fact an action game that has more in common with a pinball-game than with any other genre. The Trialight is a ball of fire that basically behaves like a pinball. The player controls the Firestriker who can freely walk across the screen and strike at the Trialight to control its movement. Levels are filled with obstacles, destroyable block and monsters. Monsters and blocks can only be destroyed by the Trialight. The goal of each level is to maneuver the Trialight towards the exit of the screen. The exit is usually blocked by destroyable obstacles and sometimes certain conditions (such as killing all monsters or destroying certain objects) have to be fulfilled before a level can be completed. If the Firestriker is killed or the Trialight falls off the screen, the player loses a life. Additionally to the Firestriker, the player can use the shoulder buttons to control a magician who (in single player mode) stays at the bottom of the screen. The levels consist of several screens and are entered from a world map. As the game progresses, the player will also fight several bosses and free other Firestrikers whose special abilities are necessary to complete the game.[CR]Firestriker also features a two-player cooperative mode as well as a duel-mode for up to four players.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Go to Next Level or Instantly Kill Current Boss[CR]Enter the code in the middle of the game (Action Scenes Only)</plot>

				<title_clean>Flashback - The Quest for Identity</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Flashback: The Quest for Identity is a sci-fi 2D action-adventure platform game in the style of Delphine's earlier Out of This World. Like Out of This World, the game's most notable feature is its use of rotoscoped animation, which allowed for extremely fluid representation of the main character's actions, like running, jumping, climbing, rolling, turning, drawing his gun and shooting.[CR]The game was originally released for the Commodore Amiga, a home computer very popular in Delphine's native France. It was ported to MS-DOS, SNES, Genesis, Atari Jaguar and the Acorn Archimedes the following year. In 1994 a CD-ROM version was created and released on the Sega CD, CD-ROM, CD-i, 3DO and FM Towns. Many of the ports were developed in part or wholly by Tiertex.[CR]Flashback was followed by a 1995 sequel, Fade to Black. It was also remade in 2013 as Flashback. The original has also been rereleased on several systems.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Flashback starts off with the main character, Conrad B. Hart, being chased by some armed men who openly fire their weapons at him. After being chased for down a corridor Conrad commandeers some sort of flying motorbike and escapes the complex he was in. The men give chase however in a much larger ship and eventually catch up and shoot Conrad out of the sky. They search the crash area for a brief time but fly off either believing Conrad was dead or just unable to find his body.AmnesiaFlashback features rotoscoped cutscenes.[CR]Conrad awakens the next day in an alien jungle on a planet known as Titan. It becomes apparent he has no memory of events prior to the chase. Upon awakening he notices that he knocked a cube-shaped object off a ledge and sets out to retrieve it. The cube contains a message recorded by the protagonist before he lost his memory. He gives no clues as to what has happened but tells him to seek out his friend Ian who is located in New Washington. Conrad then proceeds to take on the dangers of this jungle to find Ian. After battling enemies in the form of robots and mutants with other obstacles such as turrets and strange fires Conrad eventually comes across a hole in the ground that acts as an entrance to New Washington. An old man who sits near this hole trades an Anti-G Belt that negates the effects of gravity to some extent, for some credits allowing Conrad access to his next location.[CR]A short while after arriving in New Washington Conrad discovers Ian being held by a couple of New Washington Police Officers. After battling these men off Ian places Conrad in a machine that recovers his memories. It is revealed that Conrad had discovered a race of aliens was blending in with the human population on Earth in large quantity implying an eventual take over of the planet. His revelation had caught the attention of this alien race who would try to assassinate him. After they failed the first time it prompted Conrad to record the Holo-Cube message found earlier in the game and to send a copy of his memories to Ian. The game's manual would also explain that the alien race is called Morphs and killed Conrad's girlfriend. One night the aliens finally captured Conrad and took him aboard their ship. On this night they erased his memory but failed to secure him as Conrad would awaken and flee his captures, leading to what was witnessed at the beginning of the game.Employment[CR]With his memories restored Conrad decides he needs to return to Earth. With little money however, this was never going to be as easy as it sounds. Ian suggests that Conrad should take part in a TV Show where he must fight Cyborgs for a chance to win a ticket to Earth. As it would be too dangerous to compete under his own name Conrad has to get false ID papers. Ian sends him to a contact named Jack, who demands 1,500 credits for the papers. Since he doesn't have that sort of cash on hand Conrad partakes in multiple odd jobs available in New Washington.[CR]First he is hired by Titan Spaces Lines for an apparently easy job of collecting and delivering a parcel. Just outsides the parcels destination he is attacked by a member of the NWPD but overcomes him and delivers the package.[CR]The second mission comes from Virtual Crop that requests Conrad escort a VIP to their research center. It is made clear that the mission will require a firearm ad the area traveled in will be dangerous. The warning is well advised since mutants infest the area in addition to malfunctioning Security Spheres. Like previously though Conrad succeeds.[CR]Titan TV hires Conrad for the third mission. They report that a Model Cy-Borg 2.1 has escaped with the possible assistance of an outsider. It carries a virus which could spread to all other functioning cyborgs. A police officer informs Conrad that the Cy-Borg wants to make a deal. This turns out to be a trap however and Conrad kills the Police Officer for access to 2.1&#8217;s lair. Once in his hideout Conrad eliminates 2.1.[CR]The penultimate New Washington mission is accomplished for Titan Senior Advisory Board. Sabotage to the generator that supplies power to New Washington means the city is on the verge of blowing up. Conrad has 90 seconds to locate the sabotaged area and repair it. With only seconds left Conrad repairs the generator and saves New Washington.[CR]With only one mission required to gain the necessary credits for the false papers, another party hires Conrad to eliminate the mutant threat that is lurking in all the Restricted Areas. After accomplishing this task Conrad meets Jack one more time who now hands over the papers allowing entry into the game show.[CR]The game show of requires participants to fight their way through eight different levels of deadly situations. Littered throughout every level are Cy-Borg 2.1s, Sentry Spheres and mines. Conrad manages to fight through all levels and win a ticket to Earth.Back on EarthEarth[CR]Conrad believes The Morphs have a hidden base within a night club on Earth but upon arrival is attacked by the local law enforcement and security measures. After some time he locates the nightclub. He breaks in through an upper level thus causing more security measures to become active making his job of finding the Morphs more complicated.[CR]After much tribulation Conrad finds himself in a vent shaft above a group of Morphs that are discussing their plans. They reveal that soon their invasion will begin since millions of their kind are ready to teleport in and destroy humanity. Conrad&#8217;s vent then proceeds to collapse under his weight and he is discovered. It is decided that he will be thrown into the dungeon with plans for interrogation.[CR]After he wakes up in his cell Conrad discovers he is unarmed and that Cy-Borgs have been sent to his cell to carry out the interrogation. Unexpectedly though Conrad makes a quick burst for the door and evades the Cy-Borgs. Luckily enough his gun was not too far away and he is able to destroy his would-be interrogators. Further into their lair Conrad finally confronts the Morphs in combat. With their ability to take and lose shape whenever they want Conrad has a difficult time but overcomes everyone he meets. With the realization that the Morph invasion is close with no time to report it, Conrad teleports to the Morph home planet with the intention of stopping their conquest.[CR]On the planet Conrad tries to assist a human prisoner who is in possession of explosives. Unfortunately the man is killed by a Morph upon his release but lives long enough to give Conrad the destructive device. Conrad discovers a diary on the planet that reveals a captive human scientist managed to enter the theory of molecular research into a Titan computer. This theory was taken up by Conrad who made glasses revealing the aliens living among the human population. It is also revealed that The Master Brain, positions at the center of the planet, controls all morphs, destroying him will end the race. The device Conrad holds was created by the scientist and is powerful enough to destroy the entire planet.[CR]With other options being non-existent, Conrad decides to put the scientist's plan into action. He travels all the way into the planet&#8217;s core. After battling more Morphs the Master Brain is killed. After dropping the Atomic Charge into the foundations of the planet Conrad races against time to escape the planet in a docked ship before the planet explodes.[CR]Conrad only just makes it, with the ship just out of reach from the destructive force of the Atomic Device. Conrad soon learns though that he is in a galaxy unrecognized by the ship&#8217;s systems. With the possibility of being lost in space forever Conrad places himself in cryogenic suspension to be awakened if he is ever discovered.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Genesis version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 9,9,9,8 in addition to the Editor's Choice Gold award. They added, "...one of the best games ever made for the Genesis. The action is non-stop, and it really feels like you're playing a movie!...get a joystick, because the generic Sega controllers aren't precise enough to handle the diagonal motions necessary for some of the specialized techniques".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The Great Poobah has retired and is looking for a successor. Since there are so many candidates, it is decided that the person who finds the Great Treasure of Sierra Madrock will become the new Great Poobah.[CR]The player takes control over Fred and Barney who also participate in the treasure hunt in order to make Fred the New Great Poobah.[CR]The Flintstones: The Treasure of Sierra Madrock is a side-scrolling platformer that includes several board game elements. On a world map, Fred and Barney  throw dices to determine how many fields they can move. [CR]There are different fields that hold different challenges.[CR]Most fields require you to finish a side-scrolling platforming level. Fred and Barney can jump, club their enemies and climb trees or stone pillars. Holding down the jump button lets them hover in the air for a short moment. Throughout the levels, different power-ups and items can be found: clamps are used as money, apples replenish some health, 100 stars grant an extra life to Barney or Fred and an empty Heart frame increases their life bar.[CR]On fields marked with a skull, a boss has to be defeated. [CR]Heart fields hold bonus games in which you have to collect as many items as possible within the time limit.[CR]At amusement parks, several mini-games can be played to win items or extra lives. Mini-games include: Memory; Balls O' Fun", where you can win items by throwing a ball at them; a mini-game in which you have to stop monkeys from climbing down trees and stealing your items by hitting them with coconuts and others.[CR]In Cafes you can buy food to replenish your health.[CR]In stadiums you can participate in special challenges (3D cart races for example), in order to gain new abilities such as double jumps.[CR]While stadiums, cafes and amusement parks can be revisited, all other levels only need to be finished once.[CR]Fred and Barney are not the only characters that move about the playing field. You will also run into their wives Betty and Thelma as well as other characters that are also looking for the treasure. When Fred or Barney encounter their wives, they are dragged a few fields back. Other characters give them useful items if you can beat them at a challenge (usually a race).[CR]Other notable features are a password system and a competitive 2-player mode.</plot>

				<plot>Baseball player Frank Thomas licensed one of the first baseball games to use motion-captured 3D graphics and multiple camera angles. 28 stadia have been rendered in 3D, and each has its own visible and significant differences. [CR]There are 6 distinct game modes, allowing for single exhibition matches as well as full seasons on the playoffs. There is also a Home Run Derby mode, allowing the player to pelt the ball out of the ground for points. [CR]You can choose pitchers and batters, based on their statistics and form. Bowling options are set to define the delivery, with fastballs and curveballs as well as more precise setting of pace and height. Fielding is optional - it's best to leave this to the computer at first You can always alter the infield and outfield depth and shift.</plot>

				<title_clean>Frogger</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Frogger is a top-down, multi-stage action game. The player controls frogs home, while avoiding obstacles. The arcade game's popularity lead to many ports, remakes, and sequels.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Frogger about to cross the road.  [CR]The objective in Frogger is controlling frogs home using a four-way joystick. Gameplay is timed, and successful completion requires navigating several contiguous stages in each level.[CR]First, the frog must cross a highway while avoiding various automobiles. Lanes of traffic operate in alternating directions, and at different speeds. Getting squashed by a vehicle causes the player to lose one life, and restart the level.[CR]A median separates the highway from a river. In later stages, the median is occupied by a snake which will also cause the player to lose a life if touched. The river contains alternating lanes of turtles and logs, moving in alternate directions, and at different speeds. The turtles move in groups of two or three, and every other group submerges regularly. The player must navigate over the turtles while above water to reach logs in various configurations, and repeat the process until reaching home.[CR]Timing is critical as the player navigates the frog into one of five home slots. Missing the slot, or reaching the edge of the screen before leaping home loses the player one life, and restarts the stage. Once a home slot is filled, the stage restarts, and play resumes until all home slots are filled, causing the next level to start.[CR]Score is kept as each frog progresses toward home, points are tallied. Additionally, optional bonus points are gained by rescuing a lady frog atop a log by hopping over her, and bringing her into a home slot without dying. Further bonus points are earned through catching briefly-appearing flies in home slots, and finishing stages early.[CR]Later stages present the player with additional challenges from faster moving obstacles, faster submersing turtles, alligators occupying home slots briefly, snakes moving along logs, and trickier log configurations.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The popular 1990s show Seinfeld had an episode almost entirely dedicated to Frogger. In the episode George Costanza learns that a pizza place he visited frequently as a child is closing down which will lead to the unplugging of a Frogger arcade machine and the loss of his high score. At the end of the episode, from a top down view identical to the game, we see George maneuver the arcade cabinet through traffic to reach the other side of the street.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Gemfire is a strategy game from Koei, set in a fictional fantasy medieval nation. It borrows elements from previous Koei strategy series like Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Nobunaga's Ambition. Players raise armies of knights and cavalry and supplements them with fantastical creatures like dragons and gargoyles in order to take control of the nation of Ishmeria.[CR]The game was released on MSX, NES, SNES, Genesis, FM Towns Marty, the NEC PC-9801 and MS-DOS PCs. The NES, SNES and Genesis versions were released in the US. In Japan the game is known as Royal Blood, or Super Royal Blood in the case of the SNES version.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Gemfire takes place on the fictional, war-torn island of Ishmeria. The Gemfire is a crown adorned with seven jewels, each one containing a powerful being. Six of the seven jewels are wizards, the seventh being a vengeful fire dragon. The wizards were sealed inside gems as they fought to save Ishmeria. Their ultimate sacrifice trapped the dragon in a ruby, but they could not escape the spell. The King of Ishmeria turned the seven gems into a crown and used its power to bring peace to the island. When he died, his son Eselred took power.[CR]Eselred used the crown to exact a tyrannical rule. His daughter, Princess Robyn -- encouraged by the whispers of Pastha the water dragon (who once fought alongside the trapped wizards) -- destroyed the Gemfire to thwart her father's oppression.[CR]Breaking the crown scattered the gems to the far corners of Ishmeria where the island's rebellious families found and used the wizards inside to aid their quest to overthrow Eselred and unite the country in peace.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]When the game starts, players have their choice of four scenarios: Erin &amp; Ander, Flax's Shame,Terian's War, and Gemfire. While Ishmeria's shape never changes, these four scenarios change which families are in play and what provinces they control at the start of the game.[CR]Gemfire's gameplay is a mixture of stat management and basic turn-based strategy. Between battle sequences, players manage their crops, troop counts, and loyalty. Waging and winning battles depends on having adequate food stores and finances.[CR]While managing stats, the player's provinces are randomly selected. The home province, where the head of the chosen family resides, controls alliances and appointing vassals to outlying territories. All controlled places can build their troops, protect their land, and hire fifth units. They cannot make or break alliances, but they can persuade vassals from other families to defect.[CR]Each character has a unique set of stats, or character facts. Their influence over battle and cultivation is determined by their Leadership, Command ability, Charm, and Fame. The higher the score, the better they perform.[CR]Leadership: ability to protect and develop a province.[CR]Command: ability on the battlefield[CR]Charm: Charming leaders are better at persuading alliances and new recruits.[CR]Fame: Fame grows with good deeds and is important for carrying out secret missions and recruiting vassals.Battle[CR]When provinces go to war, a chess-like battlefield appears. Each side controls five units. Four units are human and the fifth is either one of the Gemfire wizards or a hired monster. The human unit totals depend on the overall hired troop number. If the ruler had 100 troops before going to war, each unit would have 25 solders. It is possible to go into battle without a fifth unit.[CR]Like chess, each piece on the battlefield has a designated range of movement. Horsemen and some fifth units move three spaces. Most units only move two. Archers, riflemen, and some fifth units can attack one space away from where they stand.[CR]The dragon, much like the Queen in chess, has the greatest range of movement and attack radius. Any enemy within a three-by-three grid from the dragon can be attacked.[CR]Battles are won if one side captures their opponent's flag, eliminates all enemies in play, retreats, or runs out of food. Capturing a base sometimes awards the victor a chance to take food or money from the loser, and in some cases capture the opposing ruler. If the ruler is captured, they can be recruited, released back to their family, or banished from the game entirely.The Island[CR]Ishmeria is broken up into 30 provinces divided among 10 families, some with a greater presence than others. Since there are 10 families and only six playable wizards, not all families control a piece of the Gemfire. To make up for this, players can hire bands of monsters to stand in as their fifth unit.FamiliesFamily NameBackgroundLankshire[CR]The King's family and unplayable. The lords loyal to Eselred are some the strongest in the game, boasting high leadership and combat percentages. They control the dragon, which is the most powerful fifth unit in the game.[CR]While many of the Lankshire vassals are powerful, Eselred himself has the lowest combat percentage in the game. He compensates for this by choosing the most fortified province as his home and maintaining a high troop count.BlancheRuled by Erin. Commands Zendor, the wizard of lightning. Erin is at war with his brother Ander, the leader of the Lyle family. Sometimes controls two Gemfire wizards at the start of the game.LyleRuled by Ander. Commands Pluvius, the master of the stars. Ander is at war with Erin and is the second-most powerful leader in the game. In two scenarios, the Lyle family controls two of the Gemfire wizards.CoryllRuled by Lars. Commands Empyron, the wizard of fire. The Coryll family control the southern corner of the island and risk having their lands destroyed by an active volcano. They are perpetually at war with the Flax family.ChrysallisRuled by Garth. Commands Chylla, the wizard of ice. Controls a small island outside of Ishmeria that is connected by a bridge. This is the most difficult family to play.FlaxRuled by Erik. Commands Scylla, the wizard of wind. They are at war with the Coryll and positioned uncomfortably between the Lankshire family and the Lyle.MolbrewRuled by Leander. Commands Skulryk, the wizard of "clouds" as the manual puts it. Skulryk emits a poisonous cloud in the shape of a skull when he attacks. The Molbrew family is small and peaceful. On most maps, they are part of the Blanche family.TateRuled by Terian. They are in a power struggle between the Blanche and Lyle families and are the least likely to surrender, no matter how out-matched they are in battle.TordinRuled by Gweyn. A small, weak southern family that is often taken over within the first few years of war. Gweyn changes alliances from Tordin to Blanche across scenarios.TudoriaRuled by Eadric. Eadric is rumored to be the bastard son of Eselred. In the Gemfire scenario, he controls the southern lands.DivasLead by Prince Loryn. Loryn was once loyal to the Lankshire family but lost faith in Eselred. This family is trapped between the Blanch and Lankshire territories and is quickly overtaken.Temperature Zones[CR]Different area of Ishmeria experience different types of weather that can change province stats.[CR]Arctic Provinces 1-5:[CR]At the end of the year, wintry weather storms over the north.

				<title_clean>George Foreman's KO Boxing</title_clean>
				<plot>Featuring heavyweight champion George Foreman, this is a boxing simulation where players, taking the role of Foreman, go through a series of twelve rounds against different boxers to win the championship title belt.[CR]Played from an third-person perspective using a view from right over the shoulders over the boxer, players can move left and right to dodge incoming punches, block and throw left and right punches. The standard punch is a cross, but by holding the Up-key pressed, jabs can also be thrown.[CR]By avoiding punches and hitting them, a superpunch often becomes available, inflicting much more damage. A fight consists of a maximum of three rounds of three minutes each. When a boxer is knocked down four times, the match is over (technical knock-out). The same happens when a boxer goes down three times in a single round (regular knock-out). When down, players need to press both punch buttons in rapid succession to get back to their feet. The screen shows an energy meter drained when punches are received. After being knocked down and during intermissions, some energy is restored.[CR]All versions, except for the Game Boy, can be played with two players. A password system is used to save the progress.</plot>

				<title_clean>Goof Troop</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Goof Troop is an action-adventure game created by Capcom, and released in 1993 for the Super Nintendo. The game is based on the children's cartoon of the same name by Disney. One of the game's key features is that two players can play cooperatively as Goofy and his son Max.[CR]Goof Troop was designed by Shinji Mikami, who later became famous for his work on games like Resident Evil 4 and Viewtiful Joe.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Max and some pirates[CR]Goofy and Max, the game's protagonaists, are heading out to fish on an absolutely gorgeous day in Spoonerville. As the two relax along the seashore, they witness a massive pirate ship sailing towards Spoonerville, with their friends Pete and P.J. aboard. They realize that their friends are aboard against their will, and they must have been kidnapped. Goofy makes a heroic attempt to pursue the boat, but ultimately is unable to catch the pirates before they arrive on their home island.[CR]Goofy and Max make haste to the Pirate island, and upon arrival encounter a group of pirates. Once they defeat their attackers, they learn that the pirates have mistaken their friend Pete for pirate captain Keelhaul Pete, who was swallowed by a massive whale long ago. Goofy and Max set off to save their friends from these delusional pirates.[CR]Unfortunately for Goofy and Max, Pete and P.J. decide that they enjoy being pirate royalty. The longer that Goofy and Max take to reach them, the more Pete wants to stay captain of these pirates.[CR]Goofy and Max, after much adventuring, find themselves at the pirate's ship. They find who they think is Pete, but when Goofy attempts to save him, he knocks him cold on accident. Upon furtherIn a cave[CR]investigation, Goofy and Max realize they have found the real Keelhaul Pete, who had recently been spat out by the whale! Goofy and Max venture into the pirate ship, still looking to save their friends. Keelhaul Pete appears again, hoping to put an end to their quest. Goofy and Max prove a formidable opponent, however, and once again knock him flat on his back. Goofy and Max arrive just in time to save Pete and P.J. from the jaws of a large gator, who Goofy finds suspcious, as the Gator is eating before supper time. Trapping Keelhaul Pete to make sure he causes no more trouble, Goofy and company leave the ship to finally relax and do a little fishing.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Goof Troop takes players through five various areas on Spoonerville Island. Players begin on a beach, followed by a village under siege, then move on to a spooky haunted castle, a mountain valley, and finally end up on a Pirate Ship where their friends Pete and PJ are being held captive.[CR]Players have a variety of options when taking on enemies by throwing items such as barrels or pots. There are also other items with more novel uses, such as a grappling hook to grab on to far off items or a bell that will catch the enemy's attention. The grappling hook comes especially in handy for crossing obstacles. Only one player can have each item at any particular time, and players must work together to get the best use out of all the game's equipment.A maze of a bridge[CR]If players come into contact with an enemy or fall prey to other hazards in the game, they lose a life. Once enough lives have been lost, they must use a continue to get back in the game. Goofy and Max can pick up red diamonds for extra lives, or special white diamonds to gain an extra continue.[CR]One of Goof Troop's main aspects are the numerous puzzles throughout each level. There are many puzzles that include kicking sliding blocks in order to press switches to open passages. Players must also search for special keys to open doors to bosses. Many of the game's items come in handy for the game's puzzles.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When reviewed by Electronic Gaming Monthly the game received scores of 7,8,8 and 8 adding, "...I can't stand games that have beaten enemies reappear when you enter the room again. Also, the game is just too easy! It seems strongly geared toward the younger playing audience". Mike Weigand disagreed, "...this game requires enough skill and brains to keep you busy, plus it keeps you coming back for more".[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>GP-1</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]GP-1 is a motorcycle racing game from Genki and published by Atlus in the US, Japan and Europe. It takes a behind-the-bike perspective established by Sega's Hang-On, enhanced by the Super Nintendo's Mode 7.[CR]The player can choose their bike, configure the bike's parts and even choose their own mechanic from a limited selection. The player wins money in races that can be spent on improving their bike.[CR]The game was followed up with a sequel, GP-1: Part II. [CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly's Mike Weigand gave GP-1 a review score of 7 out of 10. He wrote, "...This is another behind the vehicle perspective racing game except it's more like Road Rash -- you ride a motorcycle (but there is none of the side-by-side brutal fighting). Getting used to your racer takes some time, but overall it is a good racing game".[CR]</plot>

Players can also upgrade their bikes by winning races and earn points, earning enough points will let the player obtain better parts for their bike.[CR]The season mode, otherwise known as the Grand Prix is present along with a Practice and Race mode, but there is also a Battle mode that allows two friends to duke it out head-to-head on the track of their choice.

				<title_clean>Gradius III</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Arcade title screen.[CR]The ten stage, third installment to Konami's popular Gradius franchise, aptly titled Gradius III, originally appeared in 1989 at Japanese game centers (aka Japanese Video Arcades). Of the ten stages, Stage 4 was infamous as being the first to offer 2.5D action. Gradius III was also the first title in the series to offer customizable weapon sets. Most recently, Gradius III has been made widely available through Nintendo's Wii Shop as well as a PSP release in the Gradius Collection.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is infamous as being one of the hardest of the series, as the original arcade version had no way to continue the game upon losing all lives, and a continue system wasn't even in place to be used at the discretion of the owner and operator. The biggest addition is the ability for the player to edit their weapon load-out, that will come with power ups collected through the game. Players can choose predetermined setups or opt to customize their own, though certain variations of weapons are not available between modes.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]There are a few differences between the Arcade and SNES versions of the game including some stages being switched around to the SNES having less stages then the ArcadeStage #ArcadeSNESStage 1DesertDesertStage 2BubbleBubbleStage 3Volcano, UndergroundVolcano, UndergroundStage 43D High SpeedMoaiStage 5MoaiFireStage 6CellPlantStage 7FireHigh Speed ZoneStage 8PlantBoss RushStage 9CrystalMechanical Base10 (Part I for Arcade)Boss RushCell10 (Part II, Arcade only)Basen/aHidden Stage 1 (Arcade only)Gradiusn/aHidden Stage 2 (Arcade only)Salamandern/a[CR]Bosses (SNES)[CR]Stage 1GoliathStage 2Bubble EyeStage 3Big Core MK III / Iron MaidenStage 4Twin VaifStage 5Vulture DragonStage 6Choking WeedStage 7BeaconStage 8Zub Rush, Death MK II, Crystal Core, Big Core MK II , Covered Core, Dellinger CoreStage 9Disrupt, Shadow Dancer X2Final StageBacterion[CR]Ports[CR]Super NES[CR]The SNES version of Gradius III was released in 1991 and included a reduced difficulty setting and additional load-outs. The slowdown from the arcade version is replicated on this version and doesn't include the 2.5D and Crystal levels present in the arcade version. This version is the only version to include a method to continue the game once all lives are lost. A port was released for Virtual Console on April 23, 2007.Playstation 2[CR]The Playstation 2 version of Gradius III was bundled with Gradius IV and was closer to the arcade version of the game and includes the feature that allows you to edit your weapon load-out. Because of the PS2's superior processing speed, an option is included to simulate the slow down of the original arcade game or to let the game play without any lag. This version doesn't have a continue option, but it does let you select any stage you have already cleared.PSP[CR]This version was released in 2006 as part of the Gradius Collection. This version keeps the arcade tradition of not allowing you to continue once you have lost all lives.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]A soundtrack containing original music and arranged tracks was released by Konami on the Kings Records label on February 21, 1990. This music has been included on other Gradius themed albums, all released by Konami.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bonus Stage[CR]There is a bonus stage located in the game. [CR]It is located in Level 2. When you fly into the section that is lined with the blue bubbles, look for a hole in the bottom and go in it. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bonus Stage[CR]There are five bonus stages in the game. Here is how to access each one: [CR]&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;Stage 2&amp;lt;/B&amp;gt; - When you see a hole in the wall at the bottom of the screen, fly down there. [CR]Prerequisite: None [CR]&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;Stage 3&amp;lt;/B&amp;gt; - When you reach the lower level of the stage, there is a platform in the ceiling that drops down. When it drops down, fly just below the part where the platform was. [CR]Prerequisite: Destroy all of the ground targets in the stage up to that point. [CR]&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;Stage 4&amp;lt;/B&amp;gt; - In the last set of Moai heads (they look like Easter Island heads), there is one laying down which will lift itself up. Fly behind it. [CR]Prerequisite: Nothing must be highlighted on your powerup bar. [CR]&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;Stage 5&amp;lt;/B&amp;gt; - Fly just below the ceiling before the narrow corridor. [CR]Prerequisite: The hundreds digit of your score reads 5, 7, or 3. [CR]&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;Stage 7&amp;lt;/B&amp;gt; - Just after the long downward slope in the second half of the level, stay close to the ground and fly into the wall formation shaped like this: [CR]......../ [CR]........\ [CR]____*/ [CR](key: dots are empty space, lines are walls, the asterisk is there your ship should be.). [CR]Prerequisite: Unknown [CR]When you clear a bonus stage, you will end up in the next level. That's right, you don't have to fight the boss of the level you were in previously. However, if you get killed in the bonus stage, you will be taken back to the regular level, and will not be able to reenter the bonus stage.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bonus Stage[CR]The Final Boss, Bacterion, will die regardless of whether you attack it or not. Just dodge his blasts, and in fifteen or so seconds, he will spontaneously die. Even cheaper, park your ship in the bottom center of the screen, and the shots can't aim towards you![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bonus Stage[CR]Continue to hold A through the initial demo, and you'll see the entire first stage including the boss.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bonus Stage[CR]Choose "speed down" for the "!" option in the weapon select screen,[CR]if you can get enough power ups to highlight the last weapon, which will not be visible, and using it without powering up on speed up, you will get all four options, missiles, and the shield.  But if you have the laser already, it will be taken away.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bonus Stage[CR]Activate the F-Option or R-Option and collect enough power-ups so that the option selection is highlighted. Now press and hold the A button.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Great Circus Mystery Starring Mickey &amp; Minnie (JP: Mickey to Minnie Magical Adventure 2) is a Disney-themed video game starring Mickey and Minnie Mouse. The duo track down the missing people at the circus, tracking them across six different stages. Mickey and Minnie have the unique ability to change outfits during the game to use different powers. The player can choose to play as either Mickey or Minnie, the latter becoming playable for the first time.[CR]Though not clear in the US/European title, the game is a sequel to the 1992 SNES game Magical Quest Starring Mickey Mouse. It saw a GBA rerelease in 2003 titled Disney's Magical Quest 2 Starring Mickey &amp; Minnie, which made the Magical Quest connection clearer.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hidden 2-Ups[CR]When in Stage One, the Haunted Circus, you will start the game on the fairgrounds. Just ahead is a small pond with an enemy fish swimming in it. At about halfway through the water, there is a wooden support beam in the background. Swim past this and you will receive a 2-Up. [CR]In Stage Two, the Jungle, there is another opportunity for a hidden 2-Up. After beating the halfway boss (the giant turtle), you'll go a couple more screens and come to a section where you'll use the Safari outfit to slide down a number of vines. After reaching the bottom vine, swim in the water beneath, all the way to the left.  The word ''2-Up'' will appear when you have found it.</plot>

				<title_clean>Great Waldo Search, The</title_clean>
				<plot>Based on the popular Where's Waldo series of books, the player's goal is to find Waldo, who is hidden in various pictures, before the time on the clock runs out. The player controls a magnifying glass and must click on various items for different effects. Finding a clock adds more time to the search, clicking on a 150 icon adds 150 points to the score, etc.[CR]Each picture consists of 6 adjacent screens containing a continuous theme. The themes are The Carpet Flyers, The Underground Hunters, The Battling Monks, The Unfriendly Giants and The Land of Waldos. Players are given the option of playing on Normal difficulty, Expert difficulty, or playing the Land of Waldos stage. The only difference between the difficulties is that on expert there are no clock items to provide players with extra time.[CR]In all of the stages the player must find both Waldo and a scroll to complete the stage. Waldo must be found before the scroll in order to complete the stage. Waldo's dog Woof is also in each of these stages (except for the Land of Waldos) and by finding him players get to play a small bonus stage where they collect points as they control the dog on a flying carpet.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Locate Waldo or the Scroll[CR]During gameplay, on controller 2, press and hold A to have the magnifying glass automatically move to have Waldo or the scroll on the screen. The magnifying glass will locate Waldo first, but if he's already been found, it will locate the scroll instead.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Locate Waldo or the Scroll[CR]During gameplay, on controller 2, press B to break the clock and stop time.</plot>

				<title_clean>GunForce</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]GunForce was originally released in 1991 for arcades, subtitled "GunForce: Battle Fire Engulfed Terror Island." Developed and published by Irem, GunForce was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System sans subtitle. This version was released in November of 1992. GunForce is very similar to the Contra series, and essentially follows the same formula as other side scrolling action platformers of the time.[CR]The player takes control of an unnamed super soldier, protecting Earth from an undetermined menace. This soldier provides ample commentary in between stages, stating exactly what he is doing and why (e.g. "I am going into this base to destroy the enemies!").[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Some bosses appear to be directly out of Contra...[CR]GunForce's gameplay is very much akin to Contra III: The Alien Wars, another action game released around the same time. The player takes control of a super soldier, shooting away enemies in each of GunForce's five stages, while simultaneously dodging enemy fire. However, GunForce is substantially easier than Contra III, due to continues which place the player directly back into the action and scant enemy fire.[CR]As well as merely shooting away enemies, players can pick up power-ups either dropped by enemies or found in destroyed crates. There are a few different types of gun, each of which replaces the previously held gun. The laser fires through enemies, and is one of the more powerful weapons. The flamethrower is short range, with a high ammunition count, and the bazooka is powerful, long range, but has low ammunition.[CR]The game gives the player five lives. After these lives are lost, the player is prompted to continue. Continuing merely respawns the player in exactly the spot that their death occurred in, rendering the game significantly easier than other similar side scrolling action games of the time.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue Playing Longer[CR]Press start on controller two when player one is about to die.  The game will continue with a second player that has twelve more lives.</plot>

				<title_clean>Hagane - The Final Conflict</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Hagane ("Steel" in Japanese) was created by CAProduction and published by Hudson Soft. The game is a sidescrolling platformer, using ninja weapons to attack all foes and even acrobatic skills to reach areas of the game. Because of this, the game feel familiar to the original Ninja Gaiden or Strider games. The character designs are the work of Keita Amemiya who also worked on the Japan-only Rudra no Hihou as well as the Onimusha series.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]There were two clans who learned ninjutsu and black magic known as the Fuma and Koma clans. It was the job of the Fuma clan to protect a Holy Grail, whereas the Koma Clan wanted to use this Grail for ultimate power and conquer the world. They attacked the Fuma Clan and stole the Holy Grail from their hands. All members were killed except for one person, Hagane. He was then revived by Momochi by transforming him into an advanced android where his body was all robotics and his mind was still human. He then pursued forward into destroying the Koma clan and claiming back the power before it is used to conquer the world.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The games play similar to the old Ninja Gaiden games where the player can move left and right, can jump on platforms and kill enemies with his sword as well has a vast range of weapons in his disposal.WeaponsSword[CR]A good all round weapon. Used for close ranged enemies and deals a good amount of damage. It doesn't require to refill when using the sword and the sword comes out very quickly upon pressing the button.Kunai[CR]While it deals slightly less damage than the sword, it's good for picking enemies off from a distance. They fire at a straight line and have a limited stock. The player can collect extra in packs of 10.Bombs[CR]These bombs are used in a short range but can deliver extra splash damage to surrounding enemies as well. These too have a limited stock and can collect extra bombs in packs of 10.Grappling Hook[CR]While the hook can also damage enemies, its main primary use would be for latching onto ceilings or any high ground above the player. Very useful for the difficult stages.Techniques and Combat[CR]Few things that Hagane has to offer is his agility in movement and also in combat. He can pull off many types of jumps and his attacks in combination with his movement can produce different abilities.Jump - Player jumps in the air.Mid-Air Roll - Does this by rolling forward in mid air. Must time the jump perfectly to perform action.Slide - Can slide on the ground for a short amount of distance.Foot Stomp - Whilst in the air, he can bounce on enemies with his foot causing extra damage.Latch - He can latch onto ceilings or platforms above him to grab onto. Very useful for the later levels.Wall Jump - Whilst doing the Mid-Air Roll near a wall, he can wall jump and if there are 2 narrow walls, he can also wall climb to the top. However if there isn't a wall, he will slowly float back down.Somersault Attacks[CR]Not only is the somersault good for evading attacks, but can also be used to attack. These types of attacks are used with the somersault buttons and pressing the attack button. Upon holding either of the shoulder buttons, with the character facing in the appropriate direction, the character produces 3 types of somersaults, with the distance shortening each time. Pressing either the attack or jump button will result in a new technique.Number of SomersaultsAfter pressing AttackAfter pressing Jump1 - Normal somersaultDashing Forward PunchFlying Kick2 - Partially charged with green auraSpin KickSpinning Dragon Flame3 - Fully charged with yellow auraGround Dragon SmashVertical Upwards Kick[CR]Items[CR]Kunai Blades - Adds 10 additional blades to stock.Extra Bombs - Adds 10 bombs to stock.Health - Heals one bar of health.Extra Health - Add one additional health bar to life. Maximum amount of bars can be stacked to 5 bars.[CR]The levels themselves do have a strict learning curve due to the perfect timings on platforms as well as distinct boss patterns that they have.[CR][B]Bosses:[/B][CR]Musha-MukuroSummons two statues to fight.En-MikoshiOne of the machines that have been haunted.Jasei-JyuA female boss that transforms into a ferocious beast with a deadly tail.Jyuso-DamaA man that haunts a machine.Shurb-OhHaunts and morphs into a giant.Amano-IkazuchiIt is a huge rocket that is set to destroy the Earth.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Harley's Humongous Adventure (JP: Kagakusha Harley no Haran Banjou) is a SNES platformer from Visual Concepts. An inventor accidentally shrinks himself and must make his way through his house, now enormous and full of danger, to restore his original size. It was released in the US and Japan only.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Hip young scientist Harley loves inventing things in his attic lab. He's already made a jetpack and his latest invention is a machine that shrinks things. Unfortunately something goes wrong and Harley is shrunk down and the machine explodes. Now Harley must make his way through his house, collecting the parts of the machine so that he can return to normal.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is a traditional side scrolling platformer. Harley must make his way through each level to collect a piece of his shrinking machine at the end. Since Harley is small now, enemies consist of bugs, rodents and common household objects like rolling cans and bouncing rubber balls. Harley's biggest threat is a giant mutated rat that Harley faces off against multiple times. Harley has a number of different weapons at his disposal to fight off these enemies including nails, tacks, marbles, rubber bands and firecrackers. Harley can also collect items to help him like insecticide that grants him temporary immunity, jetpack fuel which he can use to fly, a parachute to survive high falls and air supplies that Harley uses to explore water filled pipes. Starting in his lab, Harley must make his way through the kitchen, bathroom, toy room (where Harley takes control of a toy tank) and the attic.[CR]Graphics[CR]The game is notable for its unique mixture of pixel art and digitized claymation. All of the clay effects were created by A-OK Animation who also worked on Claymates.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Cheat Mode[CR]At the Title Screen press the following button sequence for a Stage Select and Invincibility option.</plot>

				<title_clean>Harvest Moon</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The game starts with Jack (the default name for your character) taking over care of his grandfather's farm who has passed away. The player is given two and a half years to rejuvenate the farm and turn around its fortunes. At the end of this time period, his father evaluates his progress and the game will end, unless the player achieves the best ending which allows the player to continue.Inside of the players house. (pre-upgrade)[CR]The player is given almost free reign of how to improve their farms fortunes, choosing to either raise crops or animals solely, or a combination of the two. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game has several different aspects including; farming, husbandry and developing relationships.Tools[CR]There are five basic tools that the player can interact with and upgrade throughout the game:ToolPurposeHow to UpgradeAxe[CR]Allows the player to chop down stumps into pieces of lumber that can either be used to build fences or to upgrade your house.[CR]The axe can be upgraded to the Golden Axe, which can cut down a stump in one blow. To get the Golden Axe, equip your axe and go the mountains after the earthquake during your first winter, where a new area with a pond will have opened up. Using the axe on the pond will cause the goddess to appear. Tell her the truth (that the golden axe isn't yours) and she will give it to you as a reward for your honesty.Sickle[CR]Allows the player to cut down a square of grass or to destroy a crop.[CR]It can be upgraded into the Golden Sickle, which cuts down the six surrounding blocks around the player character in one swoop. To obtain the Golden Sickle, find the tree that falls after an earthquake in the Summer. Visit the gnomes and tell them that you use the sickle, and they will upgrade it for you.Watering Can[CR]Necessary for watering the crops and ensuring that they produce vegetables (grass does not need to be watered).[CR]The Golden Sprinkler (Gross sounding, right?) can be purchased at the tool shop on Day 20 for 2000g.Hoe[CR]Used for tilling the soil in order to prepare it for planting seeds.[CR]The hoe can only till one block at a time, until it is upgrade into the Golden Hoe, which can till six blocks in a straight line (6x1). To upgrade the hoe, during the fall of Year 1 or Year 2, a weakened gnome will appear outside your house. Give him a mushroom from the mountain an he will upgrade your hoe for you the next day.Hammer[CR]Used for breaking boulders, destroying broken fences, and removing a block of tilled soil.[CR]The Golden Hammer upgrade allows the hammer to break boulders in one swing. To get the upgrade, allow the carpenter to borrow your hammer when he asks for it. He'll upgrade your hammer out of gratitude the next day.[CR]Using tools depletes the player character's stamina. Once you run out of stamina and attempt to use a tool, your character will get dizzy and collapse, which effectively prevents him from performing any further work. The inclusion of the stamina mechanic forces players to plan out their day and what they plan to accomplish.FarmingJack removing a stump.[CR]Farming takes place on Jack's farmland. There must be a section of farmland cleared in order to start any farming.[CR]To remove weeds, simply pick them up and throw them or chop them with a sickle. To remove rocks, equip the hammer and bash the rock until it disappears (the small ones will only take one hit whereas the big ones will take longer). To remove stumps, equip the axe and hit the stump until it disappears. Destroying stumps will also add lumber to your supply. All tools can be found in the tool shed located just beneath the chicken coop.Jack watering his crops.[CR]A good amount of space to clear is enough for a three by three grid. Once cleared, take the hoe and plow the allotted area you wish your crops to go on. For everything but crops that continually grow like corn and tomatoes, three by three is ideal. For continuous crops, leave a space empty in either the center or a space touching the center. Once plowed, grab a seed bag and stand right in the center of the plowed area and toss the seeds. Seeds can be bought in town. Once planted, grab the watering can and fill it with water (you fill it by standing by a pond of water and hitting the action button) and water each section with a seed on it. Watering must be done every day until the crop is ready to be harvested. Please note that watering is unnecessary if it's grass. Grass will keep growing on it's own throughout all seasons except winter.[CR]To harvest crops, simply pick them up when ready to harvest and throw them in the shipping bin located next to the farm's exit. To harvest grass, use the sickle on the grass and it will be placed as fodder in the silo automatically.[CR]To destroy crops, use the sickle on them. To destroy grass, use the hammer on the piece of grass you want to get rid of.Husbandry[CR]Husbandry can only take place once enough fodder has been stored and enough money gathered to buy either a chicken or a cow. Once those two prerequisites are met, it's time to let the animal abuse begin.ChickensInside of the chicken coop.[CR]Chickens are relatively easy to take care of. All that needs to be done is to feed them, keep them out of harms way, and take their eggs. To feed them, take fodder out from the silo bin on the left-hand side of the coop and toss it on top of the long row at the top of the screen. For each chicken possessed, only one piece of fodder needs to be placed. Once that is done, take any eggs laid by chickens and either place them in the shipper on the lower left-hand part of the coop or on the incubator on the lower right-hand part of the coop. Once placed in the incubator, the egg will take three days to hatch. Only one egg can be in the incubator at a time.[CR]It's relatively simple to keep chickens out of harms way if they are kept cooped up. However, if they are kept outdoors on a continual basis, a number of things could happen. First of all, if they are not kept within the confines of a fence, they can be eaten without any sort of way to protect them otherwise. The other thing to worry about is the weather. If it rains, hurricanes, or snows while the chickens are outside, they can get ill and not produce eggs. With these risks, it's easy to question why people keep livestock outside, but the reason is simple: you don't have to worry about feeding them if they are outside. In other words, its saved fodder.[CR]If you get tired of your chickens at any time, you can sell them for a profit.CowsThe inside of the cow barn.[CR]Cows are taken care of similarly to chickens with a few key differences, which include needing to brushing and talking to your cows. Cows are fed the same as chickens except their food is placed in front of their stalls. Cows can also eat outside with the same consequences as chickens, but with also the benefit of a mood boost for cows. Brushing and talking to cows also boosts their moods and can be done once daily. The better the mood of the cow, the better milk it can produce. Milk can only be taken from a cow when it is an adult. To milk, take the milker, milk it, and place it in the shipper. To produce more cows, give an adult cow a miracle potion and wait twenty-one days for a baby cow to be born. Only one cow can be pregnant at a time. Like chickens, cows can also be sold for profit.[CR]The brush and milking machine can be bought from the tool shop, while the miracle potion can be bought from the livestock dealer.[CR] Attracting a WifeJack wooing Ann. Women love the sweet sound of Japanese.[CR]Developing a relationship with one of the games five potential wives takes place in the town and on the mountains. To woo women, simply talk to the woman of your choice everyday and give her an item that she likes. For example, Nina loves flowers, so give her flowers if you want her to be your gal. Do not give a woman more than one gift per day, anything given to a girl after the first item will have little to no effect on their affection for you.Turn your creepy shack into a real home to snag yourself a wife![CR]The best times for building a strong relationship are during the festivals; specifically the Flower, Harvest, and Star Night Festivals.[CR]For the Flower Festival, buy the woman of your choice perfume and dance with her. For the Harvest Festival, dance with the woman of your choice. For the Star Night Festival, go to the location where the woman of your choice will be that night.[CR]Once women wooing has reached critical mass (you can tell by sneaking a peak at her diary) and you'd like to settle down, buy the blue feather of happiness from the peddler on Sunday and propose to the lady of your choice. Make sure you have the upgraded house or she won't move in.Upgrading Your House[CR]You are also able to upgrade your house on the ranch, using gold and the materials collected from chopping down stumps. To upgrade the home, the player must talk to the carpenters in the forest. There are two upgrades available, and other than improving the appearance of your home, there are also other tangible benefits:UpgradeGoldMaterialsBenefitsUpgrade One5,000250The carpenters will give the players a clock as a gift, which allows the players to tell what time it is by pressing the 'Select' button. This is required in order to get married.Upgrade Two10,000750The carpenters will provide the player with a crib, which allows the player's wife to get pregnant.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] View Your Current Ending Sequence[CR]Hold R + L + Select immediately after the lights go out when done writing in the diary.  You must hold down the buttons the entire time.  Eventually you will see the ending sequence that would be given to you if the game ended at your current level of progress.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Choose your babys gender[CR]As soon as your wife has given birth do NOT name the baby but go outside and into the village talk to someone who should be at your house and then go back you wife will have given birth again but the baby will be the opposite gender from last time and note that you only get one baby from this.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Choose your babys gender[CR]After you start a new game and have gone through the very long introduction of meeting everybody and have gone to sleep, head out of your farm the next morning. Once you name your dog don't head for the tool shed. Instead just grab the weeds and toss them and grab the small rocks and throw them in the water. Doing so makes time freeze at 6 AM. If you were to head into a building or to use a tool the time will start moving.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Choose your babys gender[CR]If your dog is standing to the right of the table when your house is expanded, it will get stuck in the table when the expansion is complete.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Clock[CR]These unlockables are unlocked when playing through the game and performing certain tasks.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Wascaly Wabbit = 1000G[CR]At some point in the game, you can randomly find a rabbit on the mountain. If you run up to it and press A, you catch it. Then the hunter runs up and offers you 1000G to let it go.</plot>

				<title_clean>Head-On Soccer</title_clean>
				<plot>In this isometric football game, 50 national teams are represented to play in two game modes: Exhibition and Tournament (a series of seven games on four continents, with a final against the World All-Stars), with the ability to set time, difficulty level, see cutscenes after goals and if players are free to kick each other around without (many) fouls.[CR]While the game seems short-featured for 1995 standards, the tournament mode includes a twist: depending on how well the player defeats his opponents, he can trade his "standard players", who won't do anything spectacular (but at least fill up the ranks) for star players, who not only look different, are able to cross and backheel the ball but also have a unique ability at the disposal of the player:[CR]1. The Marker: can latch on an opposing player, stopping him from running away with the ball;[CR]2. Goalkeeper 1: more capable of stopping shots than the regular goalkeeper;[CR]3. Barger: this large, muscular player is able to shove everyone in his path;[CR]4. Tricky: capable of jumping (or bunny-hopping, to be more precise) with the ball tucked between his feet, avoiding tackles;[CR]5. The [B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] while it's hard to talk about fair play in a game where kicking a defenders' leg to gain a corner is (mostly) a legitimate play, this player takes the whole thing into the next level, being able to dig fouls out of nowhere, at the expense of the ball (if he's carrying it or the referee waves play on) or just some stains in his shirt (if he's trying to pull an offensive foul), with the odds of 50/50 (25% for penalties);[CR]6. Passer: capable of feeding forwards with laser-precision passes; [CR]7. Striker 1: capable of unleashing impossibly-sliced shots, scoring from virtually any position in the offensive area;[CR]8. Striker 2: best used from positions directly in front of goal, this striker features a shot that is so powerful the ball ignites as it approaches the goal;[CR]9. Goalkeeper 2: features a better chance of stopping special shots from both Strikers;[CR]In Exhibition games teams start with their own setup of start players, from none to a full team. The playing surface also affects gameplay - playing in wet grass removes all ball bounce, the opposite occurring with sand, and the most dramatic change, a rocky field where the ball can change direction after hitting the ground, turning throw-ins into corners, poor attempts on goals and vice-versa.</plot>

				<title_clean>Home Alone</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The premise of Home Alone is that the player, as Kevin McCallister, needs to collect as much jewelry, gold and silver and drop it off in the safe via laundry chutes. Kevin is armed with a water gun that will, with a few hits, stun the burglars invading his home. There are a few already-set traps like having a bowling ball fall and having a trophy fall on a robber. If the robbers get hold of any jewellery, gold or silver they will run off with it. The NES version is different than all the other versions.[CR]NES Version[CR]Robber hit by trap.[CR]The premise of Home Alone for the NES is to survive 20 minutes against two burglars from the movie - the "Wet Bandits" Harry and Marv. Kevin can do this by hiding behind certain objects, or picking up trap blocks. The trap blocks represent a certain trap via a picture, but they all do the same thing: knock the pursuing burglar out for a short amount of time. Traps can be set anywhere in- or outside the house. After a few uses the traps break. The game also shows the player a map of where they set up traps, however it does not show where the burglars are. After 20 minutes are up the game cuts to an image of the robbers being taken away by the cops.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Home Alone 2 - Lost in New York</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Though based on the movie in terms of plotline and additional dialogue, the game was in ways worlds different from the movie. Certain changes made the game more interesting in an interactive game than in a static movie, such as use of different weapons and power-ups for protection, level layouts with enemies not seen in the movie, and for the Uncle's House level, usage of hidden keys and locked doors gained only after luring Marv or Harry into specific traps laid out in the various rooms (aka the first two Home Alone movies), as well as an active scene involving the Bird Woman and her birdseed attacks.[CR]The SNES version, while boasting a soundtrack with the SNES' traditionally realistic sounding instrument synth, suffered due to slightly post-8-bit graphics and sound effects, as well as a disjointed feel of incontinuity between stages.Levels[CR]Level 1 - The Plaza Hotel[CR]Kevin's first entry to New York is the Plaza Hotel, where his father's stolen credit card helps pay the way for a nice, posh room and ideal room service. But after the hotel workers discover his ruse, he attempts to escape.[CR]Kevin leaps out of the hotel and right into the arms of his old enemies Marv and Harry, who, as well as escaping from prison and attempting to rob the Christmas toy store, have a bone to pick with Kevin and take him away. But after a quick goose on a woman, who in turn socks Marv, Kevin escapes into the confines of Central Park.[CR]Level 2 - Central Park[CR]One of New York's most popular tourist attractions, Central Park is a haven for both glamour (in the daytime) and filth (at night). Kevin enters the park at one of the worst times, having to contend with vermin and urban leeches.[CR]Level 3 - The Uncle's House[CR]Kevin knew he had an uncle who lived in New York and, after much searching, finds his house, noticing it in a state of disrepair and decay. Stones and plaster drop from the ceiling, there are holes in the floors, and several of the doors to get out are locked. Not only that, Harry and Marv have tracked him down and are both searching diligently for him and attempting to steal what remains in the house. But Kevin's set a few of his trademark traps for them to stumble across.[CR]Level 4 - The Chase[CR]After escaping from the house, Marv and Harry give chase to Kevin through the streets of New York. There are two segments to this level.[CR]Segment 1: The player must run away from Harry and Marv while avoiding the additional baddies along the way. The player must must keep running until reaching the giant Christmas tree.[CR]Segment 2: Once inside the Christmas tree, the player needs to climb to the very top and grab the flashing star in order to receive the help of the pigeon lady. The player needs to call for help for her to throw bird seeds on Marv and Harry three times each to properly defeat them and win the game. The player can bounce on the ends of the Christmas tree branches to get higher up on the screen.Reception[CR]The game has had very low critical reception. Most reviewers complain that various elements of the game change depending on what part of a level the player is on. A prominent example is made by The Angry Video Game Nerd, stating that when a key falls towards the player, the player's impulse is to collect it, Instead the key inflicts damage to the player.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Partial Invincibility[CR]This glitch is exploited in that, it will make you invincible to everything in the game that attacks you, and not to those enemies that grab you and cause you to instantly die, like marv and harry, and the hotel guy etc.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Partial Invincibility[CR]To gain this, you must find a room with a maid who throws pillows at you in the plaza hotel, and get your life all the way down to 1 cookie. Then, go into the room with the maid who throws the pillows, and stand right in front of the door, as soon as the pillow hits you, the very second (it makes a sound) you go through the door, you know you did it correctly when you will have no more cookies, but you will still be alive, now get hit by her again, and you will be at full life, and will no longer loose cookies when you are attacked.</plot>

				<title_clean>Home Improvement - Power Tool Pursuit!</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Home Improvement is a video game adaptation of the TV show featuring Tim Allen about a TV DIY showman and his family that aired between 1991-99 on ABC. It was released exclusively for the Super Nintendo and for the US market.[CR]When Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor is tasked by Binford Tool with demonstrating a new line of "Taylor-Turbo Power Tools," on his show Tool Time they are quickly stolen from the set before he can get his hands on them. Following a mysterious clue left behind with the empty crates he pursues the tools across the various sets of other TV shows being aired in the same studio. Eight ultra-powerful tools are at his disposal, with notable mentions being a nail gun, blowtorch, jackhammer and chainsaw. Tim's cohost Al and his children are also present to help rescue his tools and bring back justice to the Binford brand.Fun Fact[CR]The game was not packaged with a manual. Instead, loading screens read, "Real men do not use instructions."[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Hook</title_clean>
				<plot>In this video game adaption of the Steven Spielberg film Hook, the player takes the role of a grown-up Peter Pan, whose kids have been kidnapped by Captain Hook. Tinker Bell takes Peter back to Neverland where he must again become Pan and reclaim his children.[CR]This particular interpretation is a side-scrolling action game, in which players must hack their way past Hook's denizens through 11 levels.  These include forests, icy regions, and towns which Peter will have to jump, climb, and swim through. Magic items such as apples and pixie dust can be collected for special powers. When enemies are attacked, they simply put their hands up in surrender rather than dying, so as to make the game more child-friendly.</plot>

				<title_clean>Hunt for Red October, The</title_clean>
				<plot>Based on the movie of the same name, the Soviet Union have been building in secret a Typhoon-class submarine with nuclear strike capabilities. This war machine has been named the Red October. While on its trial run, the captain, Marko Ramius has hijacked the submarine along with it's crew. They plan to defect to the United States. Naturally, such a weapon must not be allowed to fall into American plans, and so orders are issued among the Soviet forces to destroy the Red October. [CR]You control the Red October during its run for freedom. The game plays as an underwater sidescroller. The Red October submarine can move in any of four directions. The A button fires torpedoes horizontally towards the right and the B button fires missiles vertically, upwards. Additionally, the Caterpillar drive (invisibility) may be activated for short periods of time. The player may also activate a ECM blast that will destroy all nearby offensive weapons. On the screen at all times are displays for Armor (health) and Power (fuel); should either run low, the Red October in danger of being destroyed. Power-Ups to increase or decrease the power of missiles and torpedoes may be found by destroying enemies.</plot>

				<title_clean>Hurricanes</title_clean>
				<plot>Featuring in a children's TV cartoon, The Hurricanes are the most revered team in the World Soccer League. The Gorgons are desperate to beat them in a key match - so desperate that they have made it hard for the team to even get to the stadium. Taking control of one of their star players, you must trek through the jungle, mines and a temple to get them to the stadium on time.[CR]Soccer Kid seems like a logical game to 'influence' a license of a show about brilliant football players. Arc Developments agreed. The gameplay thus has a football used as a weapon against encroaching foes. There are ropes to move across, precise jumps to time, and traps to avoid.[CR]In The Hurricanes the ball sticks closely to the player's foot, even while he is jumping. It is only released when purposefully kicked, and replaced if it hits something or is lost. It can be flicked up while you are off the ground.[CR]The levels move from left to right but on several different vertical levels, and there is often more than 1 possible path, in a manner similar to Global Gladiators. Power-up tokens can be collected and traded in. Losing one of your 5 lives takes you back tot he last restart point - losing one of your continues takes you to the start of the world.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Hyper V-Ball is a side-scrolling volleyball game that features a dozen different nations to choose from. It is the sequel to Super Volleyball, which was available on the Sega Genesis and NEC TurboGrafx-16, and this is reflected in its Japanese name, Super Volley II.[CR]The player can choose from twelve male teams and eight female teams. In addition, there is a "Hyper" league which includes eight teams comprised of robots and cyborgs which allows player to play a less realistic version of the sport. Each of the three categories has four empty spaces for player-edited teams as well.[CR]The male teams represent the following nations (those marked with an asterisk also have female teams):AlgeriaBrazil*CanadaChina*FranceGermany*Great Britain*ItalyJapan*Netherlands*Spain*United States*[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly's Mike Weigand gave Hyper V-Ball a score of 7 out of 10. He wrote, "...This is the Super Baseball 2020 of the volleyball circuit. You can select either human or robotic players. This game did an excellent job of conveying the sport of volleyball on a video game format and is sure to delight sports fans. This is one of the best volleyball video games".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]HyperZone plays like a cross between a racing game and shooter. The object of the game is to navigate each level while shooting enemies and earning points, until finally an encounter with a    boss ends each level. After enough points are acquired, the player earns an "extend" and his or her ship is upgraded in the next stage. The player's ship can receive up to six upgrades.  As a racing game, the resemblance is visual. The     mode 7 "tracks" bear a resemblance to the well-known progenitor of mode 7 racing,   F-Zero. As a rail shooter, in the same vein as  Star Fox, the player's ship is constantly pushed forward through each level. While it is possible to slow down, doing so eventually causes damage to the player's ship.  HyperZone contains eight levels in total. After the initial game is finished, it restarts from the beginning with the player continuing in the same ship and keeping score; the game loops infinitely.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 3D effect[CR]When the title screen has finished loading (the words Start and Normal are displayed), enter the code.  The title screen will turn red to confirm success.  During gameplay, press Select to toggle the effect on or off.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Unlockable ships[CR]After you accumulate a certain amount of points in this game, you will gain a new ship (which you will pilot after the level switches).  You will also gain one stock (life) along with the ship (after you have got all the upgrades, you will no longer gain any stock).</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Ignition Factor (JP: Fire Fighting) is a Super Nintendo game released in 1994. Developed by Jaleco, The Ignition Factor is a top-down action game in which the player takes on the role of a firefighter. The game aims to simulate realistic situations, tasking players with the job of saving civilians, subduing flames, and ultimately discovering the source of the fire. The Ignition Factor was rereleased on Nintendo's Virtual Console on August 25, 2011.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The Ignition Factor is broken up into different levels, reflecting a variety of settings and scenarios. The player is briefed prior to starting a mission, at which point they are able to review maps of the building, select the placement of their firetruck, and equip relevant equipment. One must account for encumbrance when selecting equipment, as bringing too many items will hinder players, limiting one's ability to both kick and sprint. Players automatically begin each level with a standard fire extinguisher and are allowed to pick from a variety of additional items including:Chemical Fire Extinguisher - This extinguisher will put out chemical fires.Electrical Fire Extinguisher - This extinguisher will put out electrical fires.Oxygen Tank and Mask - This item will let you breathe in toxic conditions.Rope - You can cross areas using the rope.Axe - Can be used to open doors.Protecting fossils from the encroaching flames.[CR]All three extinguishers start with an ammo count of 99 which is depleted through their use. Although the standard extinguisher will replenish its ammo automatically, the other two must be refilled by your allies within the mission. Players have three changes to complete any given mission, and must remain mindful of both their health and the time limit which varies between stages. Levels become increasingly dangerous over time, encouraging players to complete their objectives as quickly as possible. Players are awarded a score at the end of each stage based on several criteria, including: remaining time, civilians rescued, and items retrieved. Different scenarios will present different challenges and objectives, some of which are optional. For example, one optional objective has players protecting fossils from oncoming fire as workers remove them from a museum.Levels[CR]Each level in The Ignition Factor is broken up into multiple stages. Players who achieve a good score over the course of all the levels will unlock a bonus mission. All of the levels and their associated stages are as follows:Level 1: Pygmalion Products and Bradshaw Steel MillLevel 2: McGlone Mine, Whitney Appliances, and Dino ParkLevel 3: Paris Mine, Shylock Center, and Gemini TowersBonus Level: DM Headquarters[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter the following passwords in the password menu.</plot>

				<title_clean>Illusion of Gaia</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Illusion of Gaia (Illusion of Time in PAL territories) is a game that was released for the SNES in 1994. Incorporating action and RPG elements, the game tracks the adventures of a young boy named Will, who has been tasked with a mysterious quest by his missing father. He and his friends are swept across the world by his unfolding destiny.[CR]It is the second part of the Soul Blazer franchise, which includes Soul Blazer, Terranigma (both also for SNES) and The Granstream Saga.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The sprite-based game features an angled top-down view of the action, with the player controlling Will (in one guise or another) through the entire game. Will can attack enemies with his flute in the game's real-time combat. As the game progresses, Will gains access to "Dark Space," an extradimensional area accessible by stationary portals where he can save his game and transform himself into Freedan (and later, Shadow), a character more suited for combat. All three characters learn techniques that make them either required or preferred to advance through parts of the game.[CR]Statistical character development is limited to jewels that increase either Attack, Defense, or Health. These jewels can be found by killing all the enemies in an area, which is also occasionally necessary to release a Force that removes an obstacle to advancement. These enemies are indicated on Will's map and do not respawn once killed unless Will runs out of lives or returns to an area he has since left. Lives can be gained by collecting 100 jewels dropped by most defeated enemies. Health can be restored through the use of herbs, of which there are a finite number hidden in the game. There is no currency or merchants in the sense of traditional RPGs; however there is a Jeweler who rewards Will with items for "sending" him gems he finds (a use-action that can be activated from the gem). There are 50 such gems hidden throughout the game, and collecting them all reveals a secret level and the story behind the Jeweler.[CR]As Will's adventure leads him forward, areas and towns are left behind, oftentimes permanently. The first half (roughly) of the game world will become inaccessible by the second half. Therefore, it is important for the player to collect as many herbs, gems, and statistical jewels as possible before moving on, as failing to accomplish enough can leave Will lacking later on and make the game more difficult. Much of the game takes place in conversation, both in towns and many other, less traditional places for conversation. In some places the player must simply read the story, in others the player must spur the game forward, either by talking, waiting, watching, or fetching an apple from the marketplace.[CR]An odd note is that an entire walkthrough for the game (including the locations of the hidden jewels) is included in the game manual.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]WillWillThe hero of Illusion of Gaia, this school-aged boy returned to South Cape one year earlier without his father, who was lost during a voyage to explore the biblical Tower of Babel. Will is determined to find his father again, though he seems a bit fuzzy on what exactly happened. Since the return, he has discovered he has a limited psychic ability, and at the outset of the game finds that he is able to see (and enter) portals to another dimension called "Dark Space." He has a close relationship with his friends and relies on them for advice, companionship, and aid on his journey; yet Will, as he will come to learn, is perhaps the only one with the power to save Earth from the approach of chaos from the sky. He learns to persevere in his calling, even as others must sacrifice to help him.KaraKaraA selfish, spoiled princess of nearby Edward Castle (Edward being her father), Kara encounters Will while leaving the castle on one of her semi-regular rebellions against the stifling restraints of her life. She visits South Cape and meets Will and his grandparents before being dragged away by guards. When Will is beckoned to the castle to surrender his father's ring, she pleads for his aid in helping her escape, and when his audience goes badly, she sends her loyal pig Hamlet to release him, joining him afterwords. Kara grows more than any other character in the story, transformed by her experiences from a sulking, obstinate brat to a confident, useful contributor and Will's closest friend. As the game approaches its end, Kara reaches a potential far beyond her shallow beginnings.SethSethOne of Will's three school friends, Seth comes from a hostile home, and prefers to spend most of his time playing cards with his companions at their secret seaside cave. Intelligent and adventurous, Seth is a normal school boy of his age. He has the best diagnosis of Will's budding powers when Will demonstrates them, and comes with the other boys to join Will on his quest. Unfortunately for Seth, a strange and terrifying fate awaits him in his journey, but one that will later help Will to understand what his quest encompasses and why it is important.ErikErikAnother of Will's school friends, Erik's family is the oldest of South Cape, and their house is the biggest. This doesn't seem to rub off on Erik, though, who is Will's most affable companion, never presenting Will with difficulties and always helping with advice. Erik seems to reflect Will's former life as a normal boy, as he follows Will throughout the entire game but undergoes no particular character change from his carefree days hanging out in the cave, except in adapting to the rigors of the traveling life. Erik is a source of scatological humor, constantly being interrupted in his attempts to go to the bathroom.LanceLanceA close friend of Will, Lance also lost his explorer father in an expedition. His only remaining family is his mother, who knew Will's family. Lance is the most forthright of the group, stating his mind and pushing the others to a course of action. While not quite bossy, he's definitely comfortable putting his foot down on a course of action. Being a loyal friend, this course of action is usually to follow Will; that is, his time with one of his traveling companions bring him to find love.LillyLillyAn adolescent child from Itory Village, Lilly is protected by the Flower Spirit and can transform herself into a dandelion and fly through the air at will. While just as headstrong as Kara, Lilly is her polar opposite in experience, knowing much of nearby world from her travels, and has little patience for her. She is proud of the unique nature of her magical village and people and knows Will's family through his mother's side. She is assigned by her tribe to help Will escape from Edward Castle, but discovers her aid is unnecessary. She is an energetic, hard-working companion who wants to help Will succeed, but eventually she finds something more in another member of the group.NeilNeilWill's long-lost cousin, Neil is modeled as a Leonardo DaVinci of the world, inventing such myriad devices as the telescope, the camera, and the airplane. When their journey deposits the group relatively near his workshop, Will decides to take a detour to ask Neil for advice for how to accomplish the mysterious task he's been given. Neil is an eccentric but kind man, willing to help with the interesting challenges facing Will. An incident leading to an attack of conscience will bring Neil to leave his tinkering and adventuring behind and become respectable.HamletHamletKara's pet pig, Hamlet, displays an empathy beyond what most would expect from a farm animal. Willing to brave a dungeon, the world, and even death to help his mistress and other human beings in need, Hamlet represents a pure goodness and the duty of friendship in his brief time in the story.The JackalA bounty hunter relentlessly pursuing Kara as per her parents' orders. Though only encountered once late in the game, there are often hints suggesting he is on Will's tail.FreedanFreedanAn enigmatic "Dark Knight" whose body Will inhabits during many dungeon sections, due to his superior martial ability. Freedan also has several powers that are required to progress in dungeons.ShadowAn even more mysterious character, Shadow is able to merge with the floor and walls to reach new areas. He is unlocked for Will's use close to the end of the game.GaiaWill's main benefactor, Gaia is a goddess that represents the Earth who resides in the Dark Space, giving the player hints on where to go next. Her counterpart is the Dark Gaia, a comet currently heading towards the planet. Dark Gaia is responsible for many of the ills in the world.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Other Red Jewel Rewards[CR]During the course of the game, you can find up to 50 (sometimes missable) Red Jewels. By collecting them and giving to Gem the Jeweler, you can get additional rewards alongside the secret mansion in "Unlocking Gem's Secret Mansion" cheat.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Unlocking Gems Secret Mansion[CR]To unlock a secret stage in the game, collect all 50 Red Jewels throughout the game, then visit Gem The Jeweler in the Village Of Dao. He will see you have 50 Red Jewels and will automatically take you to his place (The Secret Mansion).</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Imperium, known in Japan as Kidou Soukou Dion ("Mobile Armor Dion"), is a vertical shoot 'em up from Jorudan and Vic Tokai. The player controls a flying mecha suit known as Imperium (US) or Dion (JP), depending on the region. While the player only has one life (with limited continues), they have a health bar that allows for up to five hits. Instead of acquiring power-ups in the field, Imperium/Dion earns XP for destroying enemies and can eventually level up and earn stronger weapons and abilities through that system.[CR]The game features an opening text crawl that explains that humanity has all but abandoned a region of space which is now occupied by a martial race of high-tech robotic lifeforms and a slave race of mechanical creatures that serve them. The slave race intends to rebel, but can only do so with a discovered suit of powered armor that only a human being can ride. However, the game is set during 2027 and the additional material suggests that an alien invasion of Earth has occurred and humanity intends to repel the invaders with a last ditch effort involving the mech suit Imperium/Dion.[CR]This Imperium is not to be confused with the 1990 Electronic Arts strategy/adventure/simulation game Imperium, despite the similar sci-fi setting.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Incredible Crash Dummies, The</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Incredible Crash Dummies (known as "The Incredible Crash Dummies: Slick Bouya no Daichousen" in Japan. The subtitle roughly translates as "Slick's Great Challenge") is an action platformer game based on the Incredible Crash Dummies license, a toy series that became an animated TV show. The player controls Slick, one of the titular Incredible Crash Dummies, and must rescue Dr Zub from the evil Junkman before he can use the good Doctor's knowledge to create an army of robots.[CR]The game was released on many home systems of the era, some of which varied slightly in their presentation and gameplay. [CR]Game Boy Version[CR]The Game Boy version of The Incredible Crash Dummies featured many different forms of gameplay, resembling more of a mini-game collection than its Super Nintendo counterpart. Players must either successfully crash the playable dummy, or successfully pass the Dummy through various levels.Levels (Dummy Stunts)[CR]Five separate stunts await the Dummy for testing. The Roof Jump comprises of a vertical drop off the edge of a burning building. Players receive more points for each awning they are able to break, and for each fire hazard they are able to avoid. A target is painted on the sidewalk, which the Dummy must hit in order to progress to the next stage of testing.[CR]The Air Bumper stage puts the Dummy behind the wheel of a new car model, with improved air bumper safety features. The player must steer the car over air cans in order to inflate the bumper, while avoiding large pits on the test track, along with oil slicks that cause the Dummy's vehicle to spin out.[CR]The Ski Slope tests the Dummy's agility and reflexes, as trees must be avoided, and points are awarded for any jumps completed.[CR]The Dummy proceeds to enter the Bomb Factory, where the player must ensure the quality of bombs created by blowing out any lit fuses. Failing to do so on any three bombs will result in the stunt starting over. Conveyor belts move the bombs from the top of the screen to the bottom, with other various items. The Dummy is instructed to smash all of the other items with a mallet, ensuring that only quality tested bombs make it through the factory.[CR]The Cruise Missle stunt is an arcade style level, where the player navigates a space ship in an extremely low gravity environment. Changing the ship's trajectory requires rotating the vehicle and igniting the engine, creating a delicate balance between speed and maneuverability as the player is timed. The Dummy must crash the ship on yet another bulls eye, ending the stunt.[CR]After the end of each stunt, the Dummy's boss will critique the player's work. The Dummy receives cash if the stunt went as planned, and a small bonus if the boss was impressed. Three levels of difficulty are presented, with easy, normal, and hard, encouraging the player to revisit each stunt for more cash.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the SNES version a review score of 4 out of 10. Mike Weigand wrote, "...This side-scrolling, survive the levels-type game is cute at times, but the poor control and mandatory cheap hits by enemies ruin things".[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures is a 1994 SNES action platformer that chronicles the three Indiana Jones films released at the time. The player, as  Dr. Henry "Indiana" Jones Jr., must progress through a series of stages inspired by the three movies via his fists, whip or with his pistol. The latter two must be found first before they can be used. The pistol is used to defeat enemies, while the whip can be used this way but can also be used as a grappling tool, for the platforming elements of the game.[CR]Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures is inspired by JVC's earlier Super Star Wars series. The game makes special emphasis on the sound and look of the movies, with action that is fast-paced and Arcade-like.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The first level of the game takes place in South America, 1936, the setting of the introduction of Raiders of the Lost Ark.

The second level takes place trudging through the snow in Napal. The following level has Indy progressing to the top of the bar which in the game has multiple floors. He has to outrun the fire while the bar begins to disintegrate. Indy makes it to the top where he battles Toht and saves Marion, and obtain the medallion from Toht who escapes. Indy then has to go through Cairo and then the next level has him fighting a strongman on a barrel of hay in the back of a moving truck using only his fists. He then goes towards the Well of Souls and fight the Nazis who are invading Cairo.

				<plot>1581, Japan. Fearing a rebellion and striving to conquer the entire country,  the warlock Nobunaga orders to attack the Iga ninja clan. The ninjas bravely defend their village, but, being vastly outnumbered, are mercilessly slain by Nobunaga's men. Only one survived: you,  the hero of the game. Shortly before the assault you were sent to a nearby village to warn the elder of Nobunaga's attack. However, the other village is also destroyed by Nobunaga's army. You swear to avenge his crime. But for now, you are just an inexperienced young men, and are "wanted" by Nobunaga's men and ruthless bounty hunters. Will you be able to unite Japan in the ultimate struggle against Nobunaga?[CR]"Inindo: Way of the Ninja" is a console-style RPG with a touch of strategy. You navigate your hero on the world map, visit towns, and descend into dungeons. The battles are turn-based and are viewed from a third-person perspective, like in Final Fantasy games. You can move on the battle field and use melee or long-ranged attacks. You'll be able to recruit characters of various classes to your party, who will join you for profit or for other reasons. After you gain enough experience, you'll also be able to talk to daimyos (feudal rulers) of various castles and to convince them to work together against Nobunaga. You can also perform various tasks for the daimyos, such as spying.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Gain Money Without Passing Time[CR]This method is a lengthy, but otherwise practical way to earn money without having to fight in battles or performing tasks that all use game time. First off, you need a Healer Companion on your team (Like a Sage or Hermit), and they have to have the Special Skill(s) Cure 1 and/or Cure 2. Second, you have to be in a Castle/Village that sells Health Food and/or Energy Pills. All skills in this game do not use magic, making this moneymaking method very practical. With the Cure 1, you can convert Health Food (that costs 40) into Body Healer items (that costs 80) and with the Cure 2, you can convert Energy Pills to Energy Ups. Stock up on Health Food (Or Energy Pills if you have Cure 2), give them to your Healer, and use Cure 1 so that all Health Food turn into Body Healers. Once you have all converted Health Food to Body Healers, sell these Body Healers for 56 Gold, earning a 16 gold piece profit. Same thing with Energy Pills, convert with Cure 2, and sell the Energy Ups for profits. Repeat the Buy, Convert, and Sell process as many times as you need to so you have all the money you can ever have so you can buy strong weapons and items in a town.</plot>

				<title_clean>International Superstar Soccer</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]International Superstar Soccer (JP: Jikkyou World Soccer: Perfect Eleven) is a soccer game featuring international sides and is the first game in the series of the same name. It was released on the Super Famicom in late 1994 and on Super Nintendo in mid-1995. The game introduces the franchise's trademark view of the pitch, using a slightly askew angled view that nonetheless scrolls horizontally. It also uses realistic proportions for its athletes and focuses more on realism than many of its contemporaries.[CR]The game would be followed by International Superstar Soccer Deluxe the subsequent year. In Japan the game is a sequel, where it is known as Jikkyou World Soccer 2: Fighting Eleven, but is treated more of an enhanced edition of the original overseas. Many sequels would follow on the N64, PS1, Saturn and PS2. International Superstar Soccer and its sequels would later go on to influence Konami's later ISS Pro and PES (Pro Evolution Soccer) franchises.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]The 2 codes will last until you turn off the SNES (you can reset it and the codes still will be working).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Special Game[CR]Reach the end of the 2nd season on 1st place to play a game against the Super Star Team. If not, then you'll play a Championship game against whoever is in 1st place.</plot>

Exhibition - One match that can be configured for singles or doubles, and single-player or two-player.Tournament - Same as Exhibition, but with several matches in a row with different competitors.Nations Cup - A real-life contest now known as the World Team Cup. A doubles competition.Championship - A single-player contest against various CPU opponents.[CR]There are various instances where two players can play a doubles match: the game allows for a competitive version (one human, one CPU on each side) and a co-operative mode (two humans on one side, two CPU on the other).[CR]</plot>

The golfer with the least amount of strokes wins.[CR]Tournament mode has golfers competing in either one day (18 holes) or two days (36 holes) of golf. Scoring is figured out by how many strokes over or under par a golfer made to finish a hole.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] consists of first choosing a golfer type of either a power hitter, all-around, technician, or magician. Each type has its own proficiencies in the drive, power, accuracy, hook, slice, and back spin categories.[CR]When on the golf course the player can choose a club, their stance, direction of where to hit the ball, and the power of the swing. Once that is decided, the swing is determined by a meter which measures the accuracy of the shot and determines whether the ball gets hit straight, hooks, or slices.</plot>

				<plot>Izzy's Quest for the Olympic Rings is the official game of the mascot of the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. As the name suggests, Izzy must find the five Olympic rings, hidden by the guardians so that Izzy does not take them to his world.[CR]The game plays a lot like Mario games; to eliminate an opponent Izzy must jump over his head. There are two jumps available, the ball jump suitable for height and the hurdle jump, suitable for distance. Both allow Izzy to clear an enemy, but the second harms  him.If Izzy is hit, then he must find three medals, or at the next hit he loses a life. There are some extra objects, like Olympic torches, and eggs that hatch either objects for bonus points, trampolines or  morph points to reach otherwise inaccessible areas or traps. Izzy can also morph into a glider, a baseball player, an archer or a rocket, among others, to overcome some sections of the levels.[CR]Graphics and sound remain faithful to the cartoony origins of the mascot.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]During gameplay, pause and press the listed buttons to activate the corresponding cheat.

It is named for and features the likeness of prodigious professional golfer Jack Nicklaus, and frequently references his nickname "the Golden Bear" in the game.[CR]The game has a lot of customization options and two 18-hole courses. The player can create their own course by selecting holes from either course in any order. The player can also select to practice by either choosing a hole to try out, a putting green on which to practice putting or a driving range to get used to the swing controls.[CR]Before each hole, Jack Nicklaus dispenses some advice. It can be related to the hole, or just a useful tip in general. [CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>James Bond Jr</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]James Bond Jr. is an NES and SNES game based on the adventures of James Bond's nephew, James Bond Jr. The game is actually based on the cartoon that was released in the 90s and cancelled shortly after. The NES and the SNES versions are actually two different games.[CR]NES Version[CR]In this version the player assumes the role of James Bond Jr. In the first level Bond Jr. is tasked with finding 5 missiles in 45 minutes in an underground complex. Each time he reaches a bomb, he must disarm it via a tile mini game where the player must rearrange the tiles to match the picture the game is showing.[CR]In level two, Bond Jr. must unlock 6 safes in an underground enemy base that's full of enemies and invisible doors. Once the safe has been found, the player has nine tries to find the 4 digit code that randomly changes each time they fail. The player must do all this under 25 minutes.[CR]James Bond Jr. has bombs to blow up certain walls and a trusty gun to shoot bad guys with. To switch weapons the player must press the select button. Bond Jr. can also jump.[CR]SNES Version[CR]This version was in color as opposed to its NES version. It was a mix of shooting and platforming. In the first level, the player must pilot a helicopter equipped with missiles and bombs while avoiding enemy missiles and trees. The second level takes place in a Mayan temple. This level is known for being particularly frustrating as it is full of snakes and Bond can only kick or punch up and thus not hit the enemies. Bond Jr. can mesmerize the snakes with a flute or kill them with grenades.[CR]The game alternates vehicle and exploration missions. Level three is another helicopter mission, level four takes place in the sewers where Bond Jr. must avoid radioactive pools, spikes and mini waves. He can pick up gadgets like a gas mask and grenades that freezes water. The level ends with a boss fight against a submarine.[CR]Level 5 has Bond Jr. piloting a spaceship in a level that looks a lot like Super R-Type. In level 6, he arrives at the enemy's space base where he must avoid turrets and other other such obstacles. He must then defeat the final boss and the game ends like this:[CR]"You'll pay for this James Bond Jr.!", to which Bond answers, "No problem, scum lord! Keep the change!".[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Jetsons, The - Invasion of the Planet Pirates</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Jetsons: Invasion of the Planet Pirates is a 2D scrolling platformer featuring George Jetson and other characters from the 1960s Hanna Barbera cartoon property. George is tasked by Captain Zoom (his son Elroy's favorite comic book hero) to use a Pneumo Osmatic Precipitator (or POP, a vacuum-like device) to deter an alien invasion by the SPREE (Space Pirates Reveling in Evil Enterprises). Most of the level design centers around the pneumatic properties of the POP device, which allows George to climb walls, throw blocks around, swing across ceilings and breathe underwater.[CR]The game was developed by Sting Entertainment, a Japanese developer better known for unusual tactical RPGs like Yggdra Union and Knights in the Nightmare, and originally published by Taito for the US in mid-1994.[CR]In 1995 video game and magazine publishers Kadokawa Shoten commissioned Sting to create a platformer based on their Marukatsu Super Famicom magazine's mascot character, Yokai Buster Ruka-chan, and Sting's pre-existing Jetsons game received a graphical overhaul to fit the new license. It is a rare case of an existing licensed game being changed for Japanese audiences rather than for Western audiences - as was the case for Yo! Noid, Ninja Kid, Dragon Power, Chubby Cherub, Cratermaze and others, all of which were based on Japanese manga/anime licenses that wouldn't have been recognizable in the US and Europe at the time.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Health Refill (The Jetsons: Invasion of the Planet Pirates)[CR]Pause the game and enter in the code.If you entered it correctly, it will be confirmed by making George Jetson grunt, and take effect after unpausing.You can only use the refill code once per screen, you may use it again when you reach the next screen, or restart the current screen.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Health Refill (The Jetsons: Invasion of the Planet Pirates)[CR]Pause the game and press in order the following buttons:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Health Refill (The Jetsons: Invasion of the Planet Pirates)[CR]Pause the game and press in order the following buttons:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Health Refill (The Jetsons: Invasion of the Planet Pirates)[CR]Pause the game and press in order the following buttons:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Health Refill (The Jetsons: Invasion of the Planet Pirates)[CR]Go to the "Options" mode.

				<plot>So has this ever happened to you? You're sitting there with your bud, and you just got finished with a dinosaur demolition derby (Tyrannasaurus Wrecks), and a bunch of Neandrithals storm into your village and scare away all the cave babes. No?! Well, that's what happened with our pre-historic heroes, Joe and Mac. Now they have to run our pre-history and save the beautiful cave babes.[CR]Joe and Mac is a fun game with excellent graphics that keep you chuckling and a sound track that fits the game's zany nature. This game is fun and humorous, so have fun, Gamer.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]Joe and Mac is a beat-em-up / platformer that takes place in the Stone Age. Start out in the "level select" area which is much like Super Mario 3. Run to the grey circles to save your progress and the red circles to play the level.[CR]Run around each level beating up on Neandrithals and little dinosaurs. Your health is marked on the upper left hand corner of the screen and can be increased by food that can be found along your way or dropped by the bad guys.[CR]Use your club and other weapons you find along the way that you can throw, such as bones, fire, and boomerangs. Fight your way through each level to get to the boss, a huge dinosaur like a T-Rex or Pterodactyl, and save a cave babe. Save all the cave babes and you win![CR]Just for you people that don't like playing alone, team up with a friend and play two player mode. Play as both Joe and Mac, although there is no difference in the way either of them play, and save the babes together. Good Luck, Cave Man, and go get your girls back.

In some levels, you'll ride in a stone cart, trying to hope over gaps and avoid enemies as you try to reach the end.[CR]Improving on the original's platformer/brawler co-op gameplay, this game adds adventure and role-playing game elements that create a more involving experience compared to the first game. You can now collect coins in the levels to purchase items from Tiki Village, such as meat to recover your health, or even remodel your hut back at your home village. The game also uses a password system to track your progress. The game also shifts to an overhead map so you can wander to whichever level you wish, and return to completed levels to earn more money or power-ups.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Status passwords[CR]Enter codes on the password menu.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Passwords[CR]Select the password option from the main menu.</plot>

				<title_clean>John Madden Football</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]John Madden Football was developed after EA saw how well Earl Weaver Baseball did a few years before. The game was the first in the long-running Madden NFL franchise. The game featured John Madden on the cover however the franchise started featuring NFL athletes on the cover in 2000 on the cover of Madden NFL 2001.[CR]John Madden Football is also the only Madden game to release on the Commodore 64 and Apple II. [CR][B]Features:[/B][CR]No Real Teams [CR]Although the Madden games are now known for their up-to-date rosters of real NFL teams and players, John Madden Football does not include actual NFL teams or players because no NFL or NFLPA licenses existed for the franchise at the time. There are, however, teams that are based off of actual NFL teams.No Season Play[CR]Real teams aren't the only difference between this version of Madden and latter day versions; there is also no season play in John Madden Football. The only mode of play is single games. Create-A-Team[CR]The game has a "blank" team that the player can create from scratch and either play as them or let the computer take over. It's possible to change player numbers, names, positions, and ratings.Field Conditions[CR]The game has four different field conditions options: hot, rain, snow, or cold and windy. Quarter Length[CR]There are four different quarter length options: 8, 10, 12, or 15 minute quarters. Playbook Creator[CR]Although the game comes with two playbooks, one for offense and one for defense, there is a play creator for anybody to create their own.Save System[CR]Players can save their games at any time using a separate disk.Other Options[CR]The game featured other options that disabled fatigue, penalties, injuries, cross-hair passing, or the 30 second clock. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy defense[CR]Take control of your fastest defender and line him up directly in between the offense's guard and center, but a hair above where they are standing. If done correctly, you will not be called offsides when the play begins. The line of scrimmage in Madden 92 is parallel to the feet of the offensive lineman as opposed to the ball, which is why you're able to line up so close to the offense in the first place.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy defense[CR]When the ball is snapped, you'll usually have plenty of time to blast your defender through the line untouched, and you'll be able to stop virtually every play in the game.</plot>

				<title_clean>Judge Dredd</title_clean>
				<plot>Judge Dredd is a platform action game based on the British comic book character of the same name and the 1995 movie that tarnished that name.  The game was a multi system release so it fits the standard console jump/shoot/duck formula although it does add some unique twists such as wounding enemies so that they surrender and can be arrested.[CR]The initial levels follow the plot of the movie with futuristic lawman Judge Dredd framed and sent to the Aspen penal colony from which he must escape and prove his innocence.  Following the fight at the top of the Statue of Liberty that ended the film, the game continues on with levels and characters inspired by the comic book culminating with a battle against the Dark Judges on Deadworld.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Cheat Mode[CR]At the copyright information screen.

Most of the animals he comes upon, however, are inexplicably hostile, so he must defend himself with a variety of thrown weapons, such as bananas and boomerangs. [CR]To complete each level, Mowgli must collect a number of crystals (how many - it depends on the difficulty levels) within a time limit. A compass in the corner of the screen helps him by showing the direction where the nearest crystal is.</plot>

				<title_clean>Jurassic Park</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Jurassic Park is an action game released on multiple systems to tie-in with the movie of the same name. In each version of the game the player takes on the role of Dr Alan Grant and follows the events of the movie (and the book it is based on).[CR]There are numerous differences between the various versions. The titles on Nintendo's platforms were handled by Ocean Software while Sega's titles were developed by BlueSky Software.[CR]The 1993 Sega CD version, which is an a point and click adventure game rather than an action game, has a separate page here.[CR]Genesis Version[CR]A Tyrannosaurus breaks through the wall of the power plant.[CR]BlueSky's Genesis title is a 2D platformer which allowed the player to play as either Dr. Grant or a Velociraptor while they attempted to escape Isla Nublar. Since the game began development before the film had been completed the designers had to borrow heavily from the novel for stages. With additions like the pump station and river levels being ripped directly from the novel.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] when selecting Dr. Grant is a standard side-scrolling action platformer. As he attempts to escape the island he amasses an arsenal of non-lethal weapons such as darts, smoke grenades, and tasers. This character's series of levels leads him through locales such as a power plant, a river (where he pilots a motorboat), and the interior of an active volcano. Grant's finale sees him reaching the visitor's center and escaping the island via helicopter.The hunt continues.[CR]Opting to play as the Velociraptor gives the player access to a completely different arsenal, namely the raptor's claws. The raptor's main goals are to eventually defeat Dr. Grant and reach the mainland. Playing through each level will require the raptor to defeat armed guards still stationed on the island as well as other hostile dinosaurs. The raptor's campaign is noticeably shorter than Grant's, completely skipping levels such as the volcano and river. Completing the game as the raptor shows that it successfully escaped the island by concealing itself in a crate that is loaded into a cargo ship.[CR]After the successful sales of the Genesis version BlueSky released a sequel to Jurassic Park, Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition. The Master System and Game Gear versions of the game were similar to the Genesis version, but developed by Sega separately in Japan and didn't feature the raptor protagonist.[CR]SNES Version[CR]The SNES version of Jurassic Park is incredibly different from its Genesis counterpart. In the game the player controls Grant from a top down perspective and is given the task of collecting a number of velociraptor eggs before they hatch. Along with a much more cartoony and brighter look, it also has first-person indoor sections in the same vein as Doom where Grant has to collect key cards and codes for use outside.[CR]For the most part, the game is very open-ended, not unlike some earlier Zelda games. The game requires Grant to do a lot of backtracking and hunting for items which helps progress the player through the story. Unfortunately the game has no save or password function so the player would have to collect all of the eggs in one sitting, a very daunting task with lots of trial-and-error gameplay involved.[CR]Game Gear Version[CR]The Game Gear version has more in common with the Genesis version, being a side-scrolling shooter. With the only weapon being a pistol, the player once again assumes the role of Dr. Grant. Progression from level to level is non-linear, giving the player the option to choose which area of the island they want to tackle first. Before the actual side-scrolling segments of each zone the player would play through a vehicle segment. In these segments the player would shoot down dinosaurs pursuing the jeep, successfully clearing these levels granted bonuses. Each level is unique in its design, showcasing a different area of the island, complete with a boss fight at the end. Clearing all the selectable levels opened the Visitor Center finale, where Grant would be confronted by the park's Tyrannosaurus.[CR]Game Boy &amp; NES Versions[CR]The NES and Game Boy versions were basically the same game.[CR]Like the SNES Jurassic Park, the Game Boy and NES versions were also developed by Ocean Software. Also similar to the SNES version, the main goal of each stage is to simply collect a certain number of dinosaur eggs, opening access to the next area. Blocking progress through these stages is an assortment of dinosaurs, including main enemies like velociraptors, procompsognathus, and dilophosaurus. To deal with these threats, the player is given one primary weapon, bearing a strong resemblance to a rocket launcher. As Grant kills dinosaurs they drop ammunition for his armament. Interspersed between levels are boss encounters, including a sequence where the player is required to dodge stampeding triceratops, as well as a fight where Grant does battle with a Tyrannosaurus.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Jurassic Park 2 featured a cinematic opening (complete with audio dialogue, a rarity in those days) explaining that the main competitor of InGen, Biosyn, is sending in troops and scientists in an attempt to gain control of Isla Nublar for their own purposes. The instruction booklet indicates that InGen CEO John Hammond has personally asked Dr. Alan Grant (First Player) and a soldier named Michael Wolfskin (Second Player) to bring the island under control after Biosyn's attack. The game is based on an original sequel story to the original Jurassic Park film.[CR]Jurassic Park 2 follows up its impressive cut scene with conventional side-scrolling run and gun style. The player(s) can select their level from a list and play through the game's stages in any order; however, "emergency" missions also appear after each level is completed, and the order of these stages does not change. Some stages offer a simple flat design, some have a platforming focus and others feature a maze of doorways which must be navigated to locate the exit.[CR]Grant and Wolfskin can choose among three lethal weapons (rifle, machine gun, shotgun), and three non-lethal weapons (electric stun gun, tranquilizer gun, and gas grenade launcher). The lethal rounds are effective against humans and dinosaurs, while the non-lethal rounds are designed to incapacitate dinosaurs without killing them, so as to preserve InGen's investment; if the number of dinosaurs killed with lethal weapons by the player becomes too high, the game will end. Non-lethal rounds do not affect humans.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Infinite Continues[CR]At the Mission Select screen, press Press L(3), R(3), L(2), R(2), L, R, L(2), R(2), L(3), R(3)[CR]Extra Missions[CR]By playing the game on the medium difficulty you'll be able to play a final extra mission at the end of the game that is not accessible on the easy difficulty.

				<title_clean>Jurassic Park Part 2 - The Chaos Continues</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]One mission involved fighting a T-rex.[CR]Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues is a non-canonical sequel to the original Jurassic Park game, and by extension the Jurassic Park book and film.[CR]The original Jurassic Park games on Nintendo's platforms were a huge success. In response Ocean, the development house responsible for the original titles, began work on a sequel.[CR]In 1994 The Chaos Continues was released for the Game Boy and Super Nintendo. For the new game, Ocean took a new design. Unlike the original games, which were all mainly top-down perspective games, The Chaos Continues was a side-scrolling shooter. It also had an animated opening cutscene for the SNES version.[CR]SNES Version[CR]The version for the Super Nintendo is a standard sidescroller. Upon starting a new game the player is confronted with a menu screen that gives them several missions to choose from. Completing one mission brings them back to select another. Finishing missions progresses the player through the game. The main plot is that the bio-engineering company Biosyn, rival to John Hammond's InGen, dispatched troops to Isla Nublar to take control of the facilities and the dinosaurs. Hammond asks Dr. Alan Grant and soldier Michael Wolfskin to head to the island and stop Biosyn.[CR]The game's arsenal consists of a charging stun gun, machine guns, and shotguns. Utilizing the stun gun is an important factor in the game, because killing too many non-velociraptor enemies results in the island's ecosystem being destroyed, leading to the game over screen.[CR]Game Boy Version[CR]The GB version has a much different look than the SNES version.[CR]The Game Boy version is also a side-scrolling shooter, but it unfolds slightly differently. Abandoning the mission structure of the SNES version, the Game Boy version progresses strictly linearly. The game is divided into a series of similarly themed levels called zones. Most zones have two levels which requires the player to gather a set number of key cards in order to open a gate at the end of the level, with the third level being a boss battle.[CR]Interspersed between these normal zones is the occasional T-rex zone, which requires navigating a maze-like level while a Tyrannosaurus chased the player character. Collecting all the keycards in these levels resulted in an extra continue.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR]Justice League Task Force was a 2D fighting game, very similar to the Street Fighter series. It was actually the last game Blizzard developed that was not part of one of its three big franchises: Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo.[CR]In Story Mode you can play as one of the six heroes: Wonder Woman, Flash, Aquaman, Superman, Batman and Green Arrow. In Battle Mode and VS Mode beside the heroes, the three villains Cheetah, Despero and Darkseid, also are playable.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story begins with an attack on Earth by Darkseid that destroys a military base. Your chosen hero sets out to find information and gather the Justice League, only to be attacked by each hero in their respective locations. Your hero finds out that these are not the true Justice League members, and then goes to find Despero and Cheetah. After they are defeated they lead the hero to Darkseid, who has captured the rest of the team, and he forces them to fight an android replica of themselves. They then face Darkseid himself. After he is defeated, the rest of the League is freed and the military base is restored.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Options Menu[CR]Get a Game Over and the game counts down, hold Select + Start + L + R for five seconds.</plot>

				<title_clean>Kawasaki Superbike Challenge</title_clean>
				<plot>Kawasaki Superbike Challenge is a motorcycle racing game that uses the same engine as F1. It includes 14 standard-length race tracks, plus the Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race, available in both training and Championship modes. The game is unlicensed (except by Kawasaki), so all riders and teams are fictional.[CR]The game now has more polygonal roadside objects than F1, and there is still a Turbo mode, allowing for faster racing at the expense of some of the detail. You have the ability to turn on or off weather (during rainy days the graphics are darker and the bike has less traction). The number of laps on each course can be 5, 10 or 15, and there are 4 skill levels. Some changes have been made to how the vehicle handles, to emphasize the switch from cars to bikes.</plot>

				<title_clean>Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball was released for the SNES in 1994. It had the MLB license but not the license of the Player's Union, so fictionalized names (other than Griffey's) were used for the athletes. The fictional names are notable for the various themes that teams were given. For example, the Kansas City Royals were all named after United States presidents and the Baltimore Orioles are named after famous Baltimoreans.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game features exhibition and season play, as well as a 1 or 2-player Home Run Derby mode. When pitching, the player can control the path of the ball in midair, which can make 2-player competitive play sometimes infuriating. Aside from this, basic gameplay is fairly straightforward. In-game stadiums resemble their real-life equivalents and include well-known features like Fenway Park's left field wall (the Green Monster) and Baltimore's brick facade of the B &amp; O warehouse beyond right field that Ken Griffey struck with a ball during 1993's Home Run Derby.[CR]Fictional Name Team Themes[CR]Atlanta Braves - Famous DJsBaltimore Orioles - Baltimore nativesBoston Red Sox - Cheers (TV Show) characters and Boston landmarksCalifornia Angels - Famous actorsChicago White Sox - Basketball players from St. John's UniversityChicago Cubs - Sports actions or nicknamesCincinnati Reds - Prolific writersCleveland Indians - Famous ActressesColorado Rockies - Famous people associated with horror moviesDetroit Tigers - Motown singersHouston Astros - CartoonistsKansas City Royals - Presidents of the United States of AmericaLos Angeles Dodgers - Punk rockers and other musicians from CaliforniaMilwaukee Brewers - Secret agents, detectives, and superhero secret identitiesMinnesota Twins - Book charactersMontreal Expos - 1980's English musiciansNew York Mets - Punk rockers from New YorkNew York Yankees - Former Yankee greatsOakland Athletics - Prolific authorsPhiladelphia Phillies - Philly landmarks and characters from the Rocky moviesSan Francisco Giants - Workers from Software CreationsSan Diego Padres - Punk rockers from EnglandSeattle Mariners - Workers from Nintendo of AmericaSt. Louis Cardinals - ComediansTexas Rangers - Western motifToronto Blue Jays - Wigan Warriors rugby team members[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Play as Ken Griffey Jr. in Home Run Derby[CR]Hold the R button while selecting a batter in the Home Run Derby mode.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Play as Ken Griffey Jr. in Home Run Derby[CR]At The title screen, press B, A, Down, B, Up, B, B, A </plot>

				<plot>Ken Griffey Jr.'s Winning Run is a licensed arcade baseball  game featuring MLB's own Ken Griffey Jr. Released in 1996, it contains all 28 MLB teams and logos from that time, with rosters containing fictitious names for the players (Ken Griffey Jr being the only real player in the game).[CR]Next to exhibition games, there are different game modes to compete in. In the MLB Challenge, players start with a weak team and go against every major MLB club to go up the rankings. There is also a complete World Series, All-Star games and the MLB League. In the league modes up to eight players can choose a team and play a season of 26, 52 or 162 games. Between matches players can change the line-up and rotation, and trade away players.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is fairly tradition, with fielding, pitching, batting and baserunning. Next to fastball and curveballs, there are six different pitches such as Super Fast, Screwball, Super Curve, Slider, Change Up and Knuckleball.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kid Klown in Crazy Chase is an isometric endless runner from Kemco. The player, as Kid Klown, must run down a path while avoiding obstacles to reach a bomb before its fuse runs out. The game was originally released for the Super Nintendo in 1994 and was later ported to the Game Boy Advance in 2002.[CR]Kid Klown, despite (or because?) being the most accident-prone clown on the planet, is tasked by the King to rescue Princess Klown from the interstellar space pirate Blackjack. Kid Klown's starfighter fails to take down Blackjack's spaceship and hurtles back down to the planet, where he must stop Blackjack from bombing various locations.[CR]Kemco originally created the Kid Klown character for the US version of a Mickey Mouse NES game that couldn't use the Disney license in that territory: Kid Klown in Night Mayor World. He would return for the PlayStation sequels Kid Klown in Crazy Chase 2 and The Bombing Islands.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Collision with one of the many hazards and blockades will cause Kid Klown to lose some health and slow down/stop for a few seconds. He must reach the end before the fuse on a bomb beats him there, which the player can see throughout the course as well as by a gauge in the top left that compares Kid's progress to that of the bomb's fuse.[CR]As well as getting to the end before the bomb fuse, Kid Klown must also find four card suit icons by opening balloons. The balloons can be opened by jumping up and grabbing their string as they pass overhead. As well as the four icons, the balloons provide bonuses such as extra coins and health recovery items. If Kid Klown doesn't manage to grab all four icons, he must restart the stage (though his icon progress is saved - he'll only need to find the ones he missed).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Stage Select[CR]Reset the game, and on the title screen, hold L and R on both controllers, and then hit on BOTH controllers, at the same time:</plot>

				<title_clean>Killer Instinct</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Killer Instinct is a fighting game developed by Rare. It was published by Midway on the arcade, and by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy. The game is well-known for the large amount of combos that a player can dole out.[CR]Nintendo originally planned Killer Instinct for early release on the Nintendo 64. Killer Instinct and Cruis'n USA were actually among the first Nintendo 64 games announced. When manufacturing issues delayed the system's release, Nintendo debuted Killer Instinct on the SNES instead in late 1995. The N64 would instead get a port of Killer Instinct 2 entitled Killer Instinct Gold the year after.[CR]The game received a Xbox One port, which featured a training mode, the ability to pick different revisions of the game, and Xbox achievements. The game was included with the purchase of "Killer Instinct Season 1 Ultra Edition". Developed by Code Mystics.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Fulgore vs. Orchid[CR]Killer Instinct uses a basic 2D fighting layout, where players face each other from opposite sides of an arena and move primarily left and right, attacking from standing, jumping, or crouching positions. Its gameplay expanded on other 1990s fighters in important ways, including match format, multi-part combo system, and through the introduction of "breakers."[CR]Prior to Killer Instinct, most fighting games (including Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat) used a strict "best of three" round system. Both players started with the same amount of energy, fought until one side ran out, and restarted the fight. Killer Instinct replaced this with a 2-stage life bar where matches reset when a player loses half their life, but the "leader" keeps their current amount. (This makes "perfect" rounds more challenging, as victors must drain both bars without taking damage.)[CR]Killer Instinct's basic joystick and button controls closely resemble Street Fighter. Its six attacks use three strengths of punches and kicks, weak, medium, and strong. Players block by holding the stick away from their opponent (and not attacking). Most special moves use quarter-circle, half-circle, or back-forward joystick movements followed by an attack. Character-specific special moves also serve as openers to a combo chain.Combo Attack System[CR]Killer Instinct features a multi-stage attack system whose structure encouraged mastery of both basic attacks (as openers) and "continuers," moves that build into long, visually impressive combos.Combo opener: special move or jumping attack that leaves opponent "open" to combo (each character has several openers)Continuer: performed after successful opener and adds 2-4 hits; joystick + button move that's typically one "up" from the opener (weak to medium, medium to strong, strong to weak)Linker: joystick + button move that adds 2-3 hits (exact move is character-specific)Finisher: joystick + button move after linker and adds 3-4 hits (knocks opponent to ground and ends combo)[CR]An unbroken, 4-part combo scores about a dozen hits, depending on the characters and moves used. (Note that the player only performs 4 distinct button presses.) Killer Instinct's combo system created longer attacks with fewer actions than most other fighting games, a system designers created to encourage deeper knowledge of each character and limit the success of "button mashing."[CR]On defense, players can break attacker combos with a character-specific stick + button move at the start of any continuer, linker, or finisher (see Combo Breakers). Breakers end the combo's "flow" and knock the attacker back. (The match announcer says one of this game's distinctive lines, "C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER," on successful breakers.) Players must have energy in their life bar to break a combo; attackers who drain the final amount with an opener can continue their combo uninterrupted.Finishing Opponents[CR]Once attackers deplete an opponent's life bar, they can finish opponents a la Mortal Kombat with a violent "No Mercy" move or Humiliation, which forces the opponent to dance. (Humiliations require the victor to still be on their first life bar.)[CR]Attackers can also trigger an "Ultra Combo" (a knockout sequence consisting of 20+ hits) by inputting a character-specific move during their combo chain when an opponent's life bar flashes red (under 10% left). The game automates ultra finishing sequences, requiring no further button pressing; arcade players often removed their hands from the machine to accentuate their win and watch the combo play out.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Killer Cuts was a soundtrack album that was released and packaged with the video game Killer Instinct on the Super Nintendo in 1995. Many of the tracks were arranged and included the character's theme songs in addition to the songs featured in the fighting stages.

There were 11 types of combos, each with a distinctive name and delivery.3 hits: Triple combo4 hits: Super combo5 hits: Hyper combo6 hits: Brutal combo7 hits: Master combo8 hits: Awesome combo9 hits: Blaster combo10 hits: Monster combo11 hits: King combo12 hits: Killer comboFinishing combo: Ultra combo (20+ hits)[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]A mega-corporation (mega-corporations have completely replaced governments in this future) named Ultratech organizes a tournament consisting of fights to the death. Ultratech has entered some of their experimental prototypes in the contest, as well as other entrants. Most of the other entrants have some sort of motivation to joining the contest, usually due to something that Ultratech has promised them (for example, in Sabrewulf's case, Ultratech promises to heal him of his lycantrophy) Ultratech discovers a way to unleash an ancient warrior named Eyedol and enters him into the tournament.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Character DescriptionImageFulgore Fulgore is a cyborg who is the result of a cybernetic project at Ultratech. He, like other Ultratech experiments, was entered into the tournament as a test. If it was able to win, it would be produced in mass quantities. However, it was defeated by Jago.Cinder Cinder is a criminal who was promised a release from jail if he was tested on with chemical weapons. As a result, his body has been turned into fire. If he is able to defeat Glacius in the tournament, then he will return to his original form.Glacius An alien who was captured by Ultratech, Glacius was promised freedom if he wins the tournament. His body is composed of ice and water, making him able to shapeshift.Jago Jago is a Tibetan monk who follows the Tiger Spirit (who later ends up to be Gargos). Jago is on the search for enlightenment, and wants to defeat Ultratech (he believes it is his destiny).Riptor A velociraptor that has been genetically engineered by Ultratech. It is a prototype; it is a test to determine its abilities.Sabrewulf A normal human who has been transformed into a werewolf, and is promised the cure if he wins the tournament. He is likely a reference to Rare's game Sabre Wulf.Spinal Spinal is a skeleton who, through cell regeneration, is made living. He is the remains of an ancient warrior, and unlike many others participating in the tournament, fights for enjoyment. His brain could not regenerate in the process, so this is probably the reason why.TJ Combo TJ Combo is a boxer who was kicked out of his position of champion after it was discovered that his arms had cybernetic implants that improved his boxing ability. Ultratech promises him back his championship if he wins the contest.Chief Thunder Chief Thunder is a Native American who enters the tournament to find out what happened to his long lost brother Eagle. It is later revealed that his long lost brother is actually Spinal.B. Orchid A spy for an unknown entity, she is a secretary for Ultratech. Jago and B. Orchid are essentially the protagonists of the game.Eyedol The final boss of the game, Eyedol is a two-headed, ancient mystical warlord who was trapped in a dimensional prison in the distant past. Ultratech released him to be the final combatant in the tournament. It is shown in Killer Instinct 2 that the person Eyedol was trapped in combat with was Gargos, the final boss of that game.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Based on the cartoon series of the same name, King Arthur and the knights of Camelot have been encased inside glass by Morgana Le Faye. Only the Spell of Spells would be able to free them. Merlin, knowing that the world would come to ruin without King Arthur uses his magic to search all of space and time for replacements. Finding the New York Knights football team and their quarterback, Arthur King, Merlin transports them back to Camelot and gives them magical armor. Transformed into; Sir Arthur, Sir Breeze, Sir Brick, Sir Darren, Sir Gallop, Sir Lancelot, Sir Lug, Sir Phil, Sir Tone, Sir Trunk, Sir Wally and Sir Zeke,  they must rescue the real Knights of the Round Table. In order to do so, the Arthur must recover the 12 keys of truth from Morgana's lieutenants each of which can only by touched by a specific knight. However in order to be able to defeat them, Arthur must first recover Excalibur and overcome other tasks.[CR]King Arthur &amp; the Knights of Justice is a top-down action game. It might be mistaken for an RPG, however the abilities of characters do not change over the course of the game. Players control Arthur King and can recruit two additional party members from the knights. Each knight has his own statistics in various areas including: Life Force, Defense, Strength and Speed. These party members are computer controlled with their own energy bars. Arthur can move up, down, left and right, block with his shield and parry with his shield. Arthur can swing his sword at any time but the damage inflicted depends on how much strength bar he has. The strength bar replenishes itself naturally over time, but is depleted every time Arthur swings his sword. Each knight including Arthur has a health bar, when this bar runs out, the knight is defeated. It can be restored by returning to Camelot or using items such as healing herbs. Arthur can carry a variety of different items accessible from the menu. Other menu functions include looking at the map, changing preferences and reviewing the statistics of the knights.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Debug Mode[CR]When the screen with license text is displayed, enter the code using controller 2.  A sound effect will confirm success.  During gameplay, press Select on controller 2 to bring up the debug menu.  It will allow you to turn off battles, a music and SE test, ending viewer, and more.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Passwords[CR]This password places you at the climax of the game with all of the shields/keys for everyone of your knights. The password system in this game does not save any items besides shields/keys so the game requires you to do the last section (The Dark Forest/Plain of the Dead) once again before you can storm Morgana's castle. Good Luck!</plot>

				<title_clean>King Arthur's World</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]King Arthur's World (known as Royal Conquest in Japan) is a puzzle-simulation-strategy game in which the player controls King Arthur and his army as they first take charge of their homeland and then head off to bizarre new worlds in an attempt to recover the Holy Grail.[CR]King Arthur's World is one of the few third-party games on the Super Nintendo to support the SNES Mouse peripheral.[CR]The World[CR]Set in a land from Arthurian literature, the game levels range from standard English countryside, a cavernous goblin cave system, to a cloud realm rife with fantastic beasts.[CR]The Goal[CR]The player's task is to guide King Arthur from his starting base, to the leader of the enemy forces, using the various skills that his army provides to overcome obstacles such as spike pits, enemy troops and even marauding giants.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]King Arthur's World plays in a manner similar to Lemmings, in that it is a side-scrolling, unit management game with a focus on keeping as many of the King's men alive as possible. Units are given directions through the use of a cursor, a feature made easier by using the SNES Mouse.[CR]The gameplay is initially a simple A to B scenario, set in the English countryside and towns, with the occasional castle. This chapter is finished with a battle against a giant ogre, the first and easiest boss. In the following chapters, the player is required to negotiate ever more complex maps, with multiple levels, teleporting doors and increasingly harder to kill enemies. Each boss battle is more difficult than the last, and needs a large amount of firepower to defeat.[CR]Player Units[CR]King Arthur[CR]Arthur is the most important unit of the game and has many uses, in addition to being powerful and hard to kill. He is the only unit the player can use to pick up keys, gold and he alone can defeat the enemy leader. Unfortunately though, if he dies the mission is failed. It's generally advised to keep him away from harm and let the other units do the grunt work.Knights[CR]Knights are the basic ground troop, effective in hand-to-hand combat against most non-boss enemy types. Though they cannot fight a lot of monster types, they are very powerful against units they can reach. The player can temporarily boost their attack for a split second, allowing them to hit harder.Archers[CR]These ranged units are extremely effective against most enemies, though they are fragile and must be kept back out of harm's way. Capable of firing in three different trajectories, they can hit enemies blocked by the terrain or inside of towers with a little bit of trial and error. Their usefulness is decreased in the underground goblin levels, as the low ceilings prevent them from being as versatile.White Wizards[CR]The only unit capable of healing player units is the Wizard. He has three support abilities, used to bolster the players army. These are Health, Strength and Invincibility. The spells affect any allied unit on screen, and last for a limited time. Invincibility does not protect units from instant death situations like spike pits, crushers or zombie units.Black Wizards[CR]Black Wizards are powerful offensive units and if correctly employed, can turn the tide of battle. Their spells are Fireball, Firestorm, Paralyse, Lightning and Apocalypse. Of these, Firestorm and Apocalypse are probably the most effective, dealing great damage to all enemy units on screen even if behind cover. Apart from Paralyze and Apocalypse, the spells can damage the player's troops, so care is needed.Shieldmen[CR]An important tool in the player's arsenal, Shieldmen offer protection from a number of dangers and are highly resilient to attack. They block the advance of enemy units and can reverse the trajectory of boulders, fireballs and magic bolts. Since they still have a finite amount of health, they're best used in conjunction with Knights against regular enemies.Barrelmen[CR]The exploding barrels these units deploy can be used to destroy crushers and doors, or even platforms and bridges built by engineers. The fire created from their explosions can spread to anything wooden or flammable, which can be a problem sometimes.Engineers[CR]The most versatile unit in the game, engineers can often be vital to winning a mission. They can fill in spike pits, use a battering ram on castle doors, construct platforms other units can climb to avoid danger and even build a mighty catapult that causes large-scale fire damage and can have their trajectory modified similar to the Archers. They are also able to raise a new home base tent on any flagpole encountered, letting the player send reinforcements to his front line much quicker.[CR]Enemy Units[CR]Troops[CR]Weak and quickly killed by Archers or Knights.Large Knights[CR]Powerful and able to shoot magic bolts, they are dangerous to most of the player's units. Best handled with knights or the black wizard, and approached from behind so they cannot use their deadly magic bolts.Sling Shot Infantry[CR]A weak ranged unit that is limited in their range compared to archers. Can still cause trouble if fortified in a high place.Goblin Thugs[CR]Goblin hand-to-hand infantry, they are dangerous in groups.Flamethrower Goblins[CR]These enemies hurl weak fireballs across the screen.Demon[CR]Even though there are only four per level, they can appear anywhere and cause mischief. Though they are unable to emerge onto the platforms engineers have constructed. If leaving King Arthur alone, it's best to let him sit on top of a platform so a demon doesn't kill him while the player is occupied.Witch Engines[CR]A tank like enemy that can withstand much damage, they move and fire slowly.Zombies[CR]Undead creatures that move slowly and can turn friendly units into other zombies in close combat.Mutants[CR]Tough enemies who spit acid and excel in close-quater fights.Cannon Snail[CR]Cannon Snails are deadly enemies strong against most of the player's troops, though weak to ranged attacks.[CR][B]Bosses:[/B][CR]Mac Ogre[CR]The first boss encountered is this gargantuan ogre. Towering over friendly units and virtually immune to close range attacks, he makes his way slowly to the player camp. The player is advised to employ their catapults, wizards and archers against it.Steam Hammer[CR]A goblin construct of science and magic, spitting fireballs and unleashing hordes of enemy units, all whilst trying to crush King Arthur and his units.Demon Overlord[CR]The final boss, this vile dragon can tear player units asunder or reduce them to cinders. Fond of picking up troops and dropping them from a great height, it is a violent and fearsome beast.[CR]Environmental Hazards[CR]Spike Pits[CR]Fairly self-explanatory, these pits will kill any unit, invincible or not, that falls into them. Generally covered by a timed trap door, they can be crossed with a bit of skill, or filled up by Engineers.Crushers[CR]Giant spiked plates hanging from the ceiling, they can be destroyed by Barrelmen. Provide a small amount of cash upon their destruction.Cogs[CR]Following a short track, they are invincible and kill any unit they touch apart from Shieldmen.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>King of Dragons</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The King of Dragons is a side scrolling fantasy hack-and-slash brawler. At the start of the game up to two players can choose from five character classes which include an Elf, Wizard, Fighter, Cleric or a Dwarf, using the original D&amp;D Edition ruleset that categorized Elves and Dwarves as separate classes. Each class gets an upgraded weapon or armor every couple of levels. The player(s) can fight through hordes of goblins, skeletons, fish people and more, and at the end of each level there is an encounter with a boss creature.[CR]The King of Dragons was ported to the Super Nintendo in 1994 for the US, Japan and Europe. This port was developed by the nascent Prism Kikaku, which had split off from SunSoft the year previously. Prism Kikaku would change their name in 1995 to Nippon Ichi Software.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 99 Continues[CR]Begin a normal game and play until you're defeated and you have no credits left. Before the time runs out immediately press Start on Controller Two, then quickly press Start on Controller One. Then select your character with the B button and your continues( credits ) will increase to 99. </plot>

				<title_clean>King of the Monsters</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]King of the Monsters is a one-on-one fighting game in which two kaiju, or giant monsters, fight each other in various destructible cities. As well as being as the backdrop for their battle, the surrounding buildings can be picked up and used against the opponent and might occasionally contain power-ups and other items. Each of the six playable characters (five for the home ports) inhabits a separate city and has their own moveset. Most of the fighting resembles professional wrestling, with many grapples and throws. [CR]The game was created by SNK and was a prominent part of their Neo Geo library, for both its arcade and home console incarnations. It was also ported to various other home systems like the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. Its name is a take on their more famous King of Fighters series. It would eventually be followed up with a sequel, King of the Monsters 2, which instead enhanced three characters from the original game and overhauled the gameplay to be a standard side-scrolling brawler.CharactersGeon - An enormous lizard, clearly inspired by Godzilla.Woo - A giant primate inspired by King Kong.Rocky - A giant Moai/Easter Island head, like the ones in Gradius. Beetle Mania - A colossal beetle that grapples with its mandibles.Astro Guy - A suited superhero, who grows to massive size to fight monsters. Inspired by Ultraman, his name is a take on Osamu Tezuka's robotic hero Astro Boy.Poison Ghost - A green sludge monster possibly inspired by Hedorah. Doesn't appear in the ports.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kirby Super Star is a side-scrolling platformer developed by HAL Laboratory and originally published by Nintendo in 1996 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The fourth platforming-focused game in the Kirby series, Super Star is actually a collection of seven main game modes and two smaller minigames. All of the modes star eponymous protagonist Kirby, a pink puffball who can inhale his enemies and swallow them to copy their special abilities. New to the franchise is the ability for Kirby to convert his current Ability into a "Helper" AI partner which can optionally be controlled by a second player.Super Star was remade for the Nintendo DS in 2008 as Kirby Super Star Ultra, featuring enhanced graphics and sound effects, rearranged music, 3D cutscenes, four new main game modes and three new minigames. The original title was digitally re-released for the Wii and the Wii U via Virtual Console, and it also appears in the Kirby Dream Collection disc-based compilation.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As with previous Kirby titles, most of the game modes in Super Star consist of platforming through a series of levels that gradually increase in difficulty, nearly all of which contain several standard enemies and a stage boss. Kirby's basic move set allows players to walk, run, jump and fly, and Super Star introduces two new core abilities: the slide tackle and guarding to reduce damage. Besides his new slide tackle, Kirby can also inhale enemies or objects before spitting them out as his standard method of attack. However, some enemies can be swallowed to grant Kirby a special Copy ability based on the type of enemy consumed.Although the Copy mechanic was originally introduced in Kirby's Adventure, Super Star features a new set of twenty-four Copy powers for players to discover throughout the game, some of which make a return from Adventure. This is the first Kirby game that displays full in-game move lists for each of Kirby's Copy abilities, and the first to have unique hats associated with each power-up. Kirby can sacrifice his equipped Copy ability at any time in order to summon a CPU-controlled helper character corresponding to that ability. Helpers have many of the same abilities as Kirby and occasionally possess special techniques, and they all employ a unique color scheme to differentiate the helper from its enemy counterpart. A second player can play as the helper character by connecting a second controller.Ability &amp; Helper ListAbilityHelperMove List / NotesNormalN/AInhale/Spit Enemy: YNo Ability equippedBeamWaddle DooBeam Whip: YCycle Beam: Dash + YBeam Machine Gun: Dash + Y (in air)Capture Beam: Forward + Y (near enemy)Wave Beam: Hold YBombPoppy Bros.

Revenge of Meta Knight is unlocked by finishing Spring Breeze and Dyna Blade, as well as placing first in Gourmet Race. Milky Way Wishes requires completion of all four of these modes, and The Arena is only accessible after clearing Milky Way Wishes. While each game mode only allows for a single save file, three separate player profiles can be accessed from Super Star's main title screen that track players' overall progress across each of the sub-games. Earning 100% completion on a single profile unlocks the game's Sound Test.Spring BreezeKing Dedede and his minions have stolen all of the food in Dream Land, and it's up to Kirby to recover it before the inhabitants starve. The easiest and shortest of the seven main game modes, Spring Breeze is essentially a remake of the original Kirby's Dream Land with four stages and the inclusion of Copy abilities, which were not present in the original game, as well as altered stage layouts. However, Spring Breeze omits the "Castle Lololo" stage and Kabula boss from Kirby's Dream Land. It also removes the boss rush mini-stages that originally occurred prior to fighting the game's final boss, King Dedede.Stage 1 - Green Greens: A short, grassy level that gently introduces players to Kirby and a handful of his Copy abilities. Mid-Boss: Poppy Bros. Sr. | Boss: Whispy WoodsStage 2 - Float Islands: Kirby takes a swim and discovers the powerful Invincibility Candy capable of defeating even mid-bosses in one hit. Mid-Boss: Mr. Frosty | Boss: Lololo &amp; LalalaStage 3 - Bubbly Clouds: Danger appears in the skies above Dream Land in the form of Kracko, a persistent cloud-like enemy with powerful lightning attacks. Mid-Boss: Kracko Jr. | Boss: KrackoFinal Stage - Mt. Dedede: Kirby reaches the mountain fortress for a final showdown with Dedede to decide the fate of Dream Land. Boss: King DededeDyna BladeWhen Kirby is violently awoken one day by a gigantic bird named Dyna Blade, he sets out towards its nest to discover the reason behind its sudden aggression. This game features a simple world map containing four main stages, as well as two hidden stages that serve as power-up caches for several of Kirby's various Copy abilities. Although somewhat lengthier than Spring Breeze, this mode is only slightly more difficult in comparison and continues to introduce new Copy powers to the player, some of which can be used to open new areas or discover secret items.Stage 1 - Peanut Plains: A breezy area that hosts only a few enemies, but the terrain is rugged enough to keep new players on their toes. Boss: Chef KawasakiStage 2 - Mallow Castle: Kirby explores a large castle containing several secret areas and an auto-scrolling section. A hidden switch located here opens the path to Trial Room 1. Boss: BonkersStage 3 - Cocoa Cave: A mysterious cave system filled with dangerous traps and a few new enemies. Boss: BugzzyStage 4 - Candy Mountain: The final stretch leads straight up the side of a treacherous mountain brimming with lava. A secret switch here unlocks the path to Trial Room 2. Mid-Boss: Mr. Frosty &amp; Bonkers | Boss: Poppy Bros. Sr. (x2)Final Stage - Dyna Blade's Nest: At the mountain's peak, Kirby battles against the ferocious bird and makes an unexpected discovery after their fight. Boss: Dyna BladeTrial Rooms 1 &amp; 2: Together these small secret stages contain twenty Copy abilities and only a few easy enemies, allowing players to practice the use of these power-ups freely. Unlocking both Trial Rooms is required for 100% completion.Gourmet RaceA game mode that takes place in "Gourmet World" where Kirby races against King Dedede while also competing to eat the most food along the way. Players can practice any of the three courses in a solitary time trial, but Kirby must win the full three-course Grand Prix to complete this mode.Course 1 - Pumpkin Grand: A short course with gentle rolling hills and few real obstacles.Course 2 - Corn Hall: The difficulty increases in this course featuring multiple paths across much more rugged terrain.Course 3 - Onion Garden: The final maze-like course begins with five Copy pedestals that Kirby can use to keep up the pace against the insatiable Dedede.The Great Cave OffensiveThe lengthiest mode to fully complete, The Great Cave Offensive is a non-linear treasure hunt in which Kirby must collect hidden treasure chests while navigating an expansive cave system. There are a total of sixty unique treasures to discover; each one collected increases the player's overall completion rate. This game does not feature strictly-linear level design and instead shares similarities with the structure of a "Metroidvania"-style platformer, allowing for backtracking which is usually necessary for perfect completion. Collecting all of the game's treasure also requires extensive knowledge of Kirby's various Copy abilities.Sub-Tree Area: Kirby falls into an underground forest teeming with enemies. A few scattered treasures are easily found, but one inside a maze of switches requires clever timing. Boss: Fatty WhaleCrystal Area: A mine cart takes Kirby into a series of larger caves encrusted with shimmering crystal. Boss: Computer VirusOld Tower: This optional area holds many treasures, but locating them all demands patience and the assistance of Helpers. Boss: Chameleo ArmGarden Area: The path winds slowly back up through stone rooms and puffy clouds that hide some of the most valuable treasure.

Revenge of Meta Knight is the only mode to feature a time limit for each level, as well as NPC commentary during gameplay in the form of dialogue boxes at the bottom of the screen, lending Revenge a more frantic tone than Super Star's previous games. Meta Knight appears near the end for a climactic sword duel and continues to harass Kirby during the final escape sequence from the destroyed Halberd.Stage 1 - Halberd Deck: Kirby begins his assault on the main deck of Meta Knight's warship, but he is distracted by Heavy Lobster before being blown away from the ship by one of its main thrusters.Stage 2 - Orange Ocean: After landing in the ocean, Kirby quickly makes his way to shore and finds a Warp Star, but he is shot down by the Halberd's cannon and falls into a forest. Mid-Boss: Iron Mam | Boss: Whispy Woods &amp; Twin WoodsStage 3 - Forest: His second detour takes Kirby through a thick forest and up a familiar mountain; after reaching the summit, Dyna Blade gives Kirby a ride back to the Halberd. Boss: Bonkers (x2)Stage 4 - Halberd Cannon: Dyna Blade is injured by cannon-fire, but Kirby manages to board the Halberd once more and quickly destroys its Main Cannon No. 2. Mid-Boss: Meta-Knights, Jukid &amp; Poppy Bros. Sr. | Boss: Combo CannonStage 5 - Halberd Port Section: Kirby descends across the port-side hull and locates another Warp Star, which he uses to deal serious damage to the Halberd's left wing. Boss: Mr. FrostyStage 6 - Halberd Interior: Jumping into a hull breach, Kirby fights through the Halberd's maintenance ducts and is again ambushed by Heavy Lobster. This time Kirby destroys it and takes out the Halberd's right wing. Boss: Heavy LobsterStage 7 - Halberd Lower Hull: Clouds swirl beneath the belly of the Halberd, giving Kirby some much-needed cover as he infiltrates the underside of the ship and destroys its main reactor. Boss: Halberd's ReactorStage 8 - Halberd Bridge: Kirby makes his final approach towards the bridge as the crippled Halberd rapidly loses altitude, where Meta Knight awaits him for one last duel. Mid-Boss: Meta-Knights | Boss: Meta KnightStage 9 - Evacuation: Though defeated, Meta Knight relentlessly pursues Kirby as he frantically races to escape the Halberd before it crashes into the ocean.Milky Way WishesOne day the Sun and Moon began fighting ceaselessly above Kirby's home planet of Popstar, throwing the heavens into utter chaos. A jester-like resident of Popstar named Marx asks Kirby to make peace between the Sun and Moon by gathering power from each of Popstar's seven neighboring planets. This power can be used to summon Nova, a gigantic mechanical "comet" capable of granting a single wish.Milky Way Wishes sports an increased difficulty with tougher enemies and more challenging stages than those in previous modes. Kirby navigates between planets on an overworld map, allowing players to visit stages in any order. This mode also features a twist on the standard Copy mechanic in that Kirby can no longer swallow enemies to Copy their powers; instead, players must locate Copy abilities as unique pedestals hidden throughout the game's stages. Once a particular Copy ability has been acquired, Kirby can manually activate that ability at any time without the need to swallow its corresponding enemy first.After gathering all of the planets' power and summoning Nova, Marx suddenly reappears and shoves Kirby aside before making his own selfish wish to rule over Popstar. Nova complies and grants Marx incredible power, and Nova then begins to descend upon Popstar. Fortunately the comet is temporarily held back by the combined strength of the Sun and Moon, allowing Kirby to fly into Nova on a Warp Star. He destroys its mechanical core from the inside, halting Nova's advance long enough for Kirby to confront the powered-up Marx in an all-out final battle. Once defeated, Marx flies out of control toward the heavens and crashes straight into Nova, destroying them both in a massive explosion and ending the crisis on Popstar.Floria: Popstar's closest neighbor, its climate can be altered simply by entering a door, and Kirby can use these seasonal changes to open new paths. Abilities: Ice, Fighter, Cutter | Boss: Twin WoodsAqualiss: A watery planet featuring yet another tricky maze for Kirby to conquer. Abilities: Parasol, Sword, Beam | Mid-Boss: Jukid | Boss: Fatty WhaleSkyhigh: A sky-themed area resembling the Bubbly Clouds stage in Spring Breeze. Abilities: Jet, Wheel, Wing | Mid-Boss: Poppy Bros. Sr. | Boss: KrackoHotbeat: Things heat up in this lava-filled stage, but Kirby can take refuge in some mine carts later on for a quick breather. Abilities: Fire, Suplex | Mid-Boss: Bugzzy | Boss: Chameleo ArmCavios: Kirby begins this area on a mountainside and descends into the caverns of the planet, where he must fight through a series of mini-bosses. Abilities: Bomb, Hammer, Stone | Mid-Boss: Poppy Bros. Sr., Jukid, Mr. Frosty, Iron Mam, Bonkers, Chef Kawasaki, Bugzzy | Boss: Wham Bam RockMecheye: This high-tech world is actually one gigantic city packed with nasty traps and windy skies. Abilities: Yo-Yo, Plasma | Mid-Boss: Mr. Frosty, Jukid, Chef Kawasaki, Bugzzy, Poppy Bros. Sr., Bonkers, Iron Mam | Boss: Heavy LobsterHalfmoon: Nighttime eternally covers Halfmoon, which more closely resembles a loose collection of stardust than an actual planet. Abilities: Mirror, Ninja | Mid-Boss: Chef Kawasaki, Iron Mam | Boss: Computer VirusNova: Following Marx's betrayal, Kirby infiltrates the approaching Nova in this unique side-scrolling shoot-'em-up stage. Boss: Heart of Nova, Marx???: Hidden among the larger planets, this tiny area contains a few TAC enemies and one power-up. Abilities: CopyThe ArenaThe Arena is a hidden boss rush endurance mode similar to Super Smash Bros.' "All-Star Mode." Players can select from any of Kirby's standard Copy abilities before fighting through a series of nineteen randomly-ordered battles featuring every boss previously encountered in Super Star. Two of the battles are groups of mini-bosses, and one battle contains only the common enemy Waddle Dee (albeit with increased health). The Arena's final boss is always Marx. Between bouts, players may recover health using a total allotment of five Maxim Tomatoes, and they can acquire new Copy abilities from two randomly-selected Copy pedestals. A player's total completion time is displayed following a successful run.List of BossesChameleo ArmCombo CannonComputer VirusDyna BladeFatty WhaleHalberd's ReactorHeart of NovaHeavy LobsterKing DededeKrackoLololo &amp; LalalaMeta KnightMid-Boss Set #1 (Chef Kawasaki, Bonkers &amp; Bugzzy)Mid-Boss Set #2 (Poppy Bros.

When the game begins, both characters appear on opposite sides of the screen. Players must react to a sudden on-screen "!" prompt by pressing any button, with the winner being whoever strikes first without a false start. Against the CPU, Kirby's opponents will gradually react more quickly, with Meta Knight being the fastest CPU opponent. This minigame features three levels of CPU difficulty and a two-player mode.Megaton PunchThe second timing-based minigame takes place in a martial arts competition between Kirby and three separate opponents where the goal is to cause the most damage to a stack of bricks in a single strike. Three different meters must be activated in succession to build up striking power, with their strength determined by the player's timing accuracy. The competitor who deals the most damage (measured in megatons) in a single round will be declared the winner. Like Samurai Kirby, Megaton Punch also features three levels of CPU difficulty and a two-player mode.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Cameos[CR]If you use the Stone ability enough, you may turn into a statue of Samus, or a golden statue of Mario.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Cameos[CR]In Megaton Punch, if you look in the background, you'll see Mario, Luigi, and a few other people from the older mario games.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret Level in Milky Way Wishes[CR]On the level select screen in Milky Way Wishes, move kirby to the green star between Cavios and Skyhigh, and then enter the level.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A SNES localization of Japanese game Puyo Puyo, Kirby's Avalanche was never released in Japan. After Sega's successful attempt to bring Puyo to the West with Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine for the Sega Genesis, Nintendo wanted to port Puyo Puyo to the SNES with a Nintendo character. Hal Laboratory, Inc. and Compile developed Kirby's Avalanche and the game brought many firsts to the Kirby franchise. The soundtrack contains remixed tracks from Kirby's Adventure and Kirby's Dream Course, with one track from Puyo Puyo. It is the first game in the Kirby series to have voices, and Kirby and other characters between rounds speak in complete sentences. It is also the first game to call Meta Knight by his name and where he appears with his current design with sword and cape.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Like Puyo Puyo, gameplay consists of two colored blobs falling from the top of the screen. To clear these blobs, the player must match at least three same-colored blobs horizontally or vertically and any blobs left over will fall into the space. If blobs are cleared in a chain reaction, the opponent has boulders fall on their screen, which can only be cleared by popping blobs directly next to the rocks. The number of boulders dropping on the opposing player depends on how many blobs were popped and how many chain clears happened in the chain reaction.Kirby drops boulders on Whispy Woods.[CR]The single player campaign has 3 practice levels and 13 stages, each against a different Kirby enemy. In it, King Dedede challenges Kirby and other Dream Land denizens to a Avalanche Contest in Dream Fountain. There is also a versus mode.[CR]This game was re-released on Virtual Console in 2007 for 800 Wii Points. The only difference between this version and the original release is a cheat code given after completing Competition Mode can be entered on both controller 1 and controller 2. In the SNES original release, this code could only be entered on controller 2.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Custom Mode[CR]During the game Hold down A + B + X + Y on controller 2 and then reset the game. When you get to the main menu go into the Options screen and a new Custom Menu should appear.</plot>

				<title_clean>Kirby's Dream Course</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Set in the airspace above Dream Land, Kirby competes on 8 courses (64 holes total), functioning as a golf ball. The object of the game is to destroy all of the enemies while aiming for the hole in the fewest number of shots.[CR]As well as enemies, Kirby needs to be wary of various obstacles and "traps". Like any game of mini-golf, achieving the lowest score possible is preferable, with bronze/silver/gold medals unlocked depending on the accumulated score for the course. Kirby has health, lost each time a shot is made and regained upon defeating enemies, as well as lives. If Kirby loses all his lives, the game is over and the course needs to be restarted.[CR]The game also allows for two players to compete with each other. The player to sink their ball Kirby first will receive additional health as well as a more desirable score. The player can also target the other player's Kirby, causing them harm.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Kirby will curl in on himself, and then with the aid of arcing lines the player can decide on the appropriate trajectory of the "ball". After deciding on the angle and spin Kirby should follow, a power meter appears which the player uses to time how much power the current "shot" will have.[CR]Kirby loses his vacuum ability in this game, replaced by the involuntary metamorphosis of Kirby to new forms by colliding with special enemies. Once familiar with the effects of this collision-transformation, the player can use these newly acquired powers to achieve maximum enemy clean-up/Hole in One. As Kirby fells his foes, the final enemy will instantly transform into the course hole. Utilizing the environment, which includes back-bouncing sides, as well as a little geometry, is the key to victory.[CR][B]Abilities:[/B][CR]Fireball - Kirby becomes a ball of fire, able to gain a burst of speed.Freeze - Allows Kirby to slide and can freeze water.Hi-Jump - Lets Kirby jump high in the air.Needle - When used, needles poke out of Kirby and will halt his movement.Parasol - Will slow Kirby down when used, in the air it will allow Kirby to float to the ground.Spark - Can be used to get through Whispy Woods or Kracko.Stone - Turns Kirby into a stone, either stopping him dead in his tracks or making him slide down if activated on an incline.Tornado - Kirby becomes a tornado allowing him to pass obstacles and enemies, and curve his current trajectory.UFO - Kirby turns into a UFO for 10 seconds and can fly in any direction.Wheel - Gives a great boost of speed and allows Kirby to skip across water and through sand traps.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Gaining extra lives[CR]To gain an extra life, you must make a Hole in One on any level. It's usually pretty tough to do, but the extra lives come in handy late in the game![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Gaining extra lives[CR]To change your name without restarting the game, go to the member screen and highlight the file to be changed. Press L, R, and A at the same time to get to the Name Entry Screen.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Gaining extra lives[CR]If you complete all EXTRA courses with a silver or gold medal (you have to have already completed all regular courses with a silver or gold medal) two new items will appear on the main menu: Sound Room and Dance Select.  Sound Room gives you a classic sound test screen where you can hear all 125 effects and 31 music tracks.  Dance Select lets you view any of the kirby dances that happen at the end of each single and 2-player round. </plot>

				<title_clean>Kirby's Dream Land 3</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kirby and Gooey with their animal friendsKirby's Dream Land 3 (known in Japan as Kirby of the Stars 3) is a side-scrolling platformer developed by HAL and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on March 27, 1998 (in Japan) and November 27, 1997 (in North America). It is the last game published by Nintendo for the SNES in North America and was unreleased in European regions.The fifth main installment of the Kirby series (starring the pink puffball of the same name), Kirby's Dream Land 3 expands on Kirby's Dream Land 2 by adding three new animal friends: ChuChu the Octopus, Nago the Cat, and Pitch the Bird. While most of the features added in Kirby Super Star were not included (including "Helpers" and ability hats), a computer AI or second player can join in as Kirby's friend Gooey (a friendly blob previously found in Dream Land 2) at the cost of some of Kirby's maximum vitality.Set after Kirby's Dream Land 2, the game's story has the planet of PopStar (where Dream Land resides) invaded by black cloud-like objects (which possess many inhabitants, including King Dedede and his minions). It's up to Kirby, Gooey, and their animal friends to find a way to rid PopStar from the Dark Matter.Kirby's Dream Land 3 was digitally re-released (via Virtual Console) for both the Wii (on January 5, 2009) and the Wii U (on May 8, 2013). The Wii version was also used in the Kirby's Dream Collection compilation to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the series.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Kirby with some animal friends.Kirby's Dream Land 3 plays much like other Kirby platformers. Kirby travels through different stages and eats enemies to copy their attack abilities. What makes this game unusual in the Kirby series is the inclusion of Kirby's animal helpers. While they were first seen in Kirby's Dream Land 2, Dream Land 3expands on the lineup of friends by adding three new characters: Nago the cat, Pitch the bird, and Chu Chu the octopus. By traveling with one, Kirby can alter what his copy abilities do when he uses them. For example, without a friend Kirby's "Fire" ability transforms him into a fireball that acts as a battering ram. However, when he rides Rick the hamster the fire ability causes Rick to breathe fire at Kirby's enemies.GooeyGooey in action.Kirby's friend Gooey is available as a second character. Normally he is controlled by the computer and fights enemies on his own. However, a second player can take control of him and play along simultaneously with the first player. Gooey has almost all of the same moves as Kirby does, except that he heats things with a long Yoshi-like tongue instead of inhaling them. Gooey can be summoned at any time, but to do so Kirby must surrender a bar of his life meter, which will remain gone until Gooey leaves. Between them, Kirby and Gooey can only ride on one animal helper at a time. Kirby can recover his health at any time by swallowing Gooey.HeartsFancy meeting you here.To truly complete the game Kirby must earn a heart on every stage. To do this he must accomplish a mission that helps a character that hangs out at the end of every level. Looking at the character should normally give the player a hint as to what they should do to complete the mission. Examples of missions include stomping on flowers of a certain color but leaving others alone, or completing a level with a certian animal helper to show off to the character at the end. Some levels even featured cameos by other Nintendo characters; one level's heart character was Samus Aran, who would give Kirby a heart if he destroyed all of the Metroids, which only appear in that level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Access ?

				<title_clean>Knights of the Round</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Knights of the Round is a  side-scrolling brawler - in the same genre as games like  Final Fight - developed by  Capcom in the early 1990s. The game is very, very loosely based on Arthurian legend. It follows the exploits of the legendary  Arthur and two of his Knights of the Round (Table), Percival and Lancelot, as they attempt to overthrow the fictional King Garibaldi and take his throne.[CR]Knights of the Round plays as one would expect. All three characters have an attack button and jump button. Pressing the attack button several times performs powerful combination attacks, while pressing back attack allows the knights to block most incoming attacks. By pressing both attack and jump at the same time, the knights will perform a powerful spinning attack which will knock back nearby enemies, at the expense of some of the hero's lifebar, making the attack useless. The life in that lifebar could be replenished by eating a hearty helping of turkey which could be found in crates and other smashable objects. Additionally, the knights can mount  horses, which vastly increases their combat prowess.[CR]Though the characters play very similarly, each knight has strengths and weaknesses.Arthur is the balanced character, with decent speed and strength.Lancelot is a speedy character, with great maneuverability but less strength.Percival is a large, slow character, who has very powerful attacks.[CR]Knights of the Round does have a feature rarely seen in brawlers. As the knights dispatch enemies, they gain experience which increases their stats and makes them more effective in combat. As each character levels up, their appearance changes as well. For instance, Percival starts the game with blond hair and a bare chest. As he levels up, he shaves his head, and gains bulky armor.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Lagoon</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Taken directly from Lagoon's North American SNES manual, the story for the game is as follows:[CR]Who shall rise to face this threat?[CR]Long ago the peaceful land of Lakeland fell under the influence of an evil spirit, bringing despair to all. With compassion, the gods descended and vanquished the evil spirit with the sacred Moon Blade Sword. In hopes of restoring peace to Lakeland, the gods brought two babies to the land: one who represented the forces of Light, and another who represented the forces of Darkness. A sage named Mathias was charged with the responsibility of raising the two children as equals in the hope that their different, but equivalent strengths would guarentee the balance of the forces of Light and Darkness. But, the moment Mathias reached out to grasp the two children, the evil Zerah appeared and took the child of Darkness, hoping to raise the child to overcome the forces of Light. This, while Nasir, the Champion of Light, was raised by the wise Mathias, the other child grew up under the questionable tutelage of Zerah. Fourteen years have passed. Nasir, raised near the village of Atland, has become a bright youth and accomplished swordsman. Mathias has taught him well. One day, an evil spirit possessed the water on which the people of Lakeland depend, bringing sickness and disease. Demons infest this once peaceful land.[CR]Mathias spoke haltingly.[CR]"It is for this day that I have trained you, Nasir. You must discover what evil force possesses and fouls the water. Restore the purity of the water or sickness and death will plague our land. This is your destiny!"[CR]It is now your responsibility to rescue the land from the evil forces. You will face a myriad of enemies. Only by skillfully using your sword, magic, and wits will you prevail. Go forth, your quest awaits you.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Lagoon is a top-down action RPG with adventure and platforming elements. Players can move Nasir in one of four directions, and can also attack, jump, jump and attack, defend, or cast magic from each position. Of particular note, is the short range of Nasir's melee attacks. This is offset by the range of his magic attacks, which can reach the whole length of the screen. However, players may not rely on magic attacks alone. Certain enemies are invulnerable to it (like bosses), and must be dispatched with melee attacks.[CR]The basic gameflow of Lagoon follows a town-overworld-dungeon pattern. In each town, players can talk to the various townspeople, buy items and equipment, and advance the game. On the overworld, players fight their way from location to location, sometimes having previous areas being permanently blocked. In the dungeons, which range from such locales as mines, castles, dungeons, and various elemental caves, players must seek items, equipment, and the bosses within.[CR]The equipment and item system borrows heavily from Ys. As such, Lagoon has a very limted set of equipment to find, with only five pieces of equipment per sword, armor, and shield categories. However, unlike Ys, Nasir's color palette and equipped shield change to reflect the equipment status screen icon. Also borrowed from Ys is the five rings. Players can discover the Protective, Power, Defensive, Curing, and Time ring, all of which mirror the abilities found in Ys. The Protective Ring increases defensive power, the Power Ring increases offensive power, the Defensive Ring makes Nasir invincible to lesser enemies, the Curing Ring gradually heals Nasir, and the Time Ring stops the movement of weak enemies. During Nasir's adventure, he will also discover a plethora of other permanent and consumable items that will aid him in his quest. Of note, is that the status and equipment screen can not be accessed during boss fights, so players must prepare for battle beforehand.[CR]Lagoon's magic system uses a mix and match system to give players a total of 16 magical attacks. Broken down into Fire, Wind, Water, and Thunder categories, players must find both a crystal and staff to make use of magical attacks. Scattered throughout the game is the Earth, Sky, Star, and Moons Staff, and the Fire, Wind, Water, and Thunder crystal. By mixing up which crystal and staff Nasir has equipped, different attacks with different properties can be activated. This important, as certain enemies are either immune or weak to certain elements.[CR]Much like any other RPG, Lagoon utilizes a health, magic, gold, and experience point system. Defeated enemies automatically give players a set amount of gold and experience, and once a certain experience threshold is met, Nasir will level-up, gaining additional stats. Of note is the game's health and magic system, that regenerate, in any environment, as long as Nasir is standing still.[CR]Exploration in Lagoon is done much the same as in any other top-down platformer. Players must navigate a multitude of environments, each with their own set of obstacles and dangers. Players must also be careful of pitfalls, or bottomless pits, as they will instantly kill Nasir if he falls into one. However, this is offset by the game's save system, which allows players to save anywhere outside of a boss fight.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]This is the list of major characters in Lagoon, taken directly from the manual:[CR]Nasir - Born to be the Champion of Light, the protagonist has become a skilled swordsman under the tutelage of the wise Mathias. He displays intelligence and courage beyond his years.[CR]Mathias - Skilled in the art of the sword and in the ways of magic, he raised Nasir from infancy.[CR]Thor - Aligned with the forces of Darkness, he is known as a skilled swordsman and for the fact that each of his eyes is a different color.[CR]Zerah - an evil warlock, he is aligned with the forces of Darkness. He stole the child of Darkness from Mathias and raised him. He seeks to resurrect the evil spirit and bring the forces of Darkness to rule the land.[CR]Felicia - Queen of Lagoon castle, she is the only one who has the power to open the door to the Secret Place and to move the Lagoon Castle.[CR]Duma and Battler - Henchmen of Zerah.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Lamborghini American Challenge</title_clean>
				<plot>Starting out with just a basic Lamborghini and $6000, your aim is to rise to the top of the 4 divisions of racing through success on 60 racetracks across America. In each division there are 20 rival racers, up to 3 of which compete in each race at a time.[CR]The races also feature lots of local drivers (who can take crucial positions away from you and the other championship drivers), Sunday drivers going at normal speed, and police. before each race you will be told of the quality of the locals and the likelihood of police presence.[CR]When police are in the area, speeding beyond 110 Km/h could see you branded as an offender, at which point the police will try to ram you off the road, Chase H.Q.-style. You can attempt to reach the end of the race despite this damage (which eventually hampers your speed), or simply pull over and accept a fine and the loss of race points. If the police subsequently stop you, the fine is heavier.[CR]Each race costs money to enter, and your earnings can be boosted by betting on the results with the other championship drivers. If one of you wins, each driver gives you either the amount they bet or the amount you bet, whichever is lower; if a local wins you get your stake back.[CR]Lots of power-ups can be bought along the way, including tires, radar jammers, engine improvements and nitro boosts. To move up a division you must take the Divisional Challenge, a one-off trek through a tough section within the time limit. You buy a set of 3 passes for this, each allowing one attempt.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Shooting Mode[CR]Plug a Super Scope into your Super Nintendo and turn on the game. This will bring you to a new game mode in which you control your car with the Super Scope and can shoot down your opposition while racing.</plot>

				<title_clean>Last Action Hero</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Last Action Hero is a brawler that follows the plot of  Arnold Schwarzenegger's movie, released in the summer of 1993. The player controls Jack Slater, an LA police detective that must beat up hordes of thugs in order to progress through each of six stages. Most of the gameplay consists of repetitive fights against a few different types of enemies, using a very limited number of attacks. The game presents an extreme challenge to even experienced players, mirroring the difficulty of some earlier NES games.[CR]The game was released on multiple home systems. There are three discrete versions from different developers:The Bits Studios release, which is a brawler that lacks a depth of field (similar to early games in the genre, like Vigilante) and features a couple of action stages where Slater must chase down enemies via his convertible. It was released on the SNES and Genesis, and both versions are largely identical save for a few graphical and gameplay tweaks. There's also a much more compact variant for the Game Boy and Game Gear.The Teeny Weeny Games release for the NES. This is a much more standard brawler, like Double Dragon. The stages have entirely different layouts, and even includes a stage based on a dream sequence in the movie where the main character re-imagines Hamlet as an explosive blockbuster.The Psygnosis release for MS-DOS and the Amiga. This is, again, a brawler with driving sequences, though the game looks and plays completely differently to the Bits Studios release. This version originally appeared on DOS several months after the home console versions, and was ported to the Amiga by The Dome Software.[CR]Last Action Hero received overwhelmingly negative reviews from critics due to poor graphics, repetitive fighting, and a lackluster set of controls. In fact, Last Action Hero has frequently been cited as "one of the worst SNES games ever made." A rundown of all the different versions of this game can be found on Hardcore Gaming 101.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Energy refill[CR]On the first level, go right until you reach the first police car. Hit its tail light 20 times and you should hear an explosion and gain 5000 points. [CR]You can then refill your energy bar at any time by pressing and holding the R button.</plot>

				<title_clean>Lawnmower Man, The</title_clean>
				<plot>The Lawnmower Man is the game based on the 1992 movie of the same name (itself loosely based on a Stephen King short story)  starring pre-Bond fame Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist working for Virtual Space Industries in "Project 5", a secret research that attempts to increase the intelligence of primates using psychotropic drugs and VR training. [CR]With his reluctance to aim the research to military purpose, after one of the chimps escapes and shoots a guard in the process he is given a forced vacation, and while taking notes on the need for experiment with a human subject, he notices Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey), a simpleton who makes his living on odd jobs such as mowing the grass (hence, the title role). The first experiments quickly increase Jobe's intelligence, and while after an accident Angelo stopped the experiments, The Shop, a secret agency overviewing Project 5, reinserted the drugs responsible for violent behaviour into the program and sped up the treatment. As Jobe starts to develop telekinetic powers, he starts to take revenge on those who abused him before he started the treatments, and plots to take over all computers in the world.[CR]While the CD version of the game (PC, Mega CD) is an interactive movie, both cartridge versions are platformers, the player taking control of Dr. Angelo or Carla Parkette (mother of Jobe's best friend) in typical side-scrolling shooting action. The player can collect better weapons or data discs, which after collecting a number of them allow to morph into the Virtual Suit, which gives protection against a first hit. The player visits several locations seen in the movie, such as the gas pump and the VSI headquarters. [CR]The twists of the game are true-3D level connectors, based on the CG sequences of the movie, usually all involving avoiding obstacles (and the occasional shooting) at high speed in the VR world. There are four different (Virtual World, Cyber War, Cyber Run and Cyber Tube), each taking a slightly different approach (Virtual World is seen in first person, the objective being dodging obstacles such as trees and archs and reach the exit, Cyber War similar to Virtual World but with some shooting stops, Cyber Run is seen in third person and requires occasional shooting of obstacles, while Cyber Tube is a fast travel with plenty of enemies in a VR tunnel).</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Legend is a SNES game developed by Arcade Zone. The game is a side-scrolling brawler in the same vein as  Golden Axe and the  Final Fight game series. It was published in the US by Seika Corporation and in Europe by Sony Imagesoft.[CR]Legend is played through the eyes of a character seeking to depose the leader of the nation of Sellech. The country is lead by Clovious, who is an incompetent and corrupt leader. In order to do this the player character must harness the power of Beldor's spirit. Beldor was a previous leader of Sellech, and ruled as a despot.[CR]In order to complete this quest to rid Sellech of Clovius the player is expected to fight against waves of hostiles. The protagonist is able to perform many different kicks and slashes in order to dispose of foes, but also has access to magic and special, ranged, attacks. When an enemy is defeated, they will drop different items. These items can include food (for replenishing health), and 'magic bags', which replenish magic and allow devastating, screen-clearing spells. In the spirit of all good brawlers, a stronger boss lurks in wait at the end of each stage.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Legend of the Mystical Ninja, The</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Legend of the Mystical Ninja is the fifth game in the Ganbare Goemon series. It is the first game in the series to appear on the SNES, and the first to be localized for and published in America.PlotOkay, so the plot is a bit strange.[CR]The game takes place in a cartoonish representation of feudal Japan. The story follows Goemon and Ebisumaru's ( Kid Ying and Dr Yang in the non-Japanese releases) journey across Japan to rescue Princess Yuki, who had been kidnapped by the Otafu Army. Along the way, they fight past all manner of ninjas, monsters, ghosts, quiz-show hosts, villiagers, and robots.Gameplay[CR]The game is divided into multiple Warlock Zones, each one representing a different area around Japan. Each zone is split into two sections:The first section is a pseudo-3D villiage area where the protagonists fight against the various locals while  shopping for health items and powerups. These sections also host the game's  minigames, where players can take a break from the main game and earn extra cash and bonus items. The second section is a 2D side-scrolling platforming level. These levels contain the majority of the combat, and end with a climactic  boss fight.[CR]Minigames[CR]Game Center, hosted by Konami Girl[CR]The Legend of the Mystical Ninja has numerous minigames within the villiage areas in each stage. Some are within the Game Center area, while others are located in various homes and shopping centers in the level. Most of the games have a fee or opening wager to play, but usually have a way for the player to win cash or special prizes.Gradius[CR]Located in the Game Center. This is the first level of Konami's classic side-scrolling shooter, Gradius.Tear Down The Wall[CR]Located in the Game Center. Tear Down The Wall is a Breakout-style game where the player bounces a ball on a paddle to destroy bricks at the top of the screen.Hockey[CR]Located in the Game Center. An air hockey game for two players.Mole[CR]Located in the employment office. This is a Whack-A-Mole game played with the SNES controller. Moles pop up from eight holes on the play field, where each hole corresponds to a button or direction on the SNES D-pad. Players get more money for each mole struck.Paint[CR]Located in the employment office. In this game, the player controls the direction of a constantly-moving paint roller. The task is to paint as much of the canvas as possible without hitting a wall or overpainting any area. One dollar is awarded for every space that the player paints. One or two players, $80 entry fee.Goblin[CR]Located in the employment office. In Goblin, the player must toss a ball into a basket that constantly moves from side to side. The force of the throw is controlled by how long the throw button is held down. Players get money for the balls they get in the basket. Sixty-dollar entry fee.Quiz[CR]In the Quiz Show game, players are asked trivia questions about the game by Quiz Master Shimopy. There is an entry fee of $100, with the chance to win $300.DiceRoll the bones[CR]In some houses around the game, there is a woman who will offer to play a game of dice. In the game, three dice are rolled, and the player guesses whether the outcome will be 10 or lower, or 11 or higher. The player places a bet which they can double if they guess correctly, or lose if they guess wrong.Fortune-Telling[CR]The fortune-teller offers to read Goemon's future for a $50 fee. He will tell the player that something good, something bad, or nothing will happen. Based on his vision of the future, immediately upon exiting his house the player will encounter five Geishas (which can be collected for $50 each), five spear-toting villagers, or nothing at all.MazeOne of the many game-house barkers[CR]Up to two players can pay a $100 entry fee to explore a first-person labyrinth. Prizes hidden in the depths of the maze include bombs, scrolls, and cash that if found, are worth more than the fee taken at the door.Lottery[CR]Buy a ticket and participate in the game lottery. If the symbols that appear in the lottery match the symbols on the ticket, the player can win a cash prize.Memory[CR]For two players or play against the computer. Flip over two matching cards and win cash prizes. Increase the purse by matching a random special card.Horse Races[CR]The horse race track appears in the carnival area of the game in the third Warlock Zone. Players may bet as much as they like on different horses, and winnings are dependent on the odds of the fastest horse.[CR]Codes and Trivia[CR]The Konami Code[CR]In one of the houses in the game, the man living there will advise the player that if they "use the command Up Up Down Down L R L R B A...nothing will happen." True to his word, the famous Konami Code has no effect in Legend of the Mystical NinjaInfinite Hamburgers[CR]This code uses the game's password save system to activate. By entering the password vxZ lh:@Y nn3 1 $T KK hG:!&lt; ! X@ r the player will start on the third stage with an infinite supply of hamburgers, essentially granting infinite health.[CR] Konami Man[CR]The character with the winged hat who appears above the entrance to the Maze minigame is Konami Man. He was Konami's official mascot at the time The Legend of the Mystical Ninja was created. Konami Man was the star of a Japan-only Nintendo Famicom game called Wai Wai World.[CR] Deleted Scene[CR]The Japanese version of The Legend of the Mystical Ninja contained a storefront in the Amusement Park zone that was not present in the American release. Even though it is mentioned in the instruction manual as "Sammy Rye's Circus Side Show," it does not appear in the actual game. For a fee, Goemon can enter the side show and see four clones of Ebisumaru do a short dance.[CR] Takosuke[CR]On the bridge leading away from the Amusement Park zone on Awaji Island, the player encounters Takosuke. This huge red octopus is another of Konami's characters, who appears in the Parodius series. In the vignette that follows this level, Takosuke can be seen in the background, climbing the Konami headquarters building on Awaji.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Legend of Zelda, The - A Link to the Past</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Originally released in Japan in 1991, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past was released in North America and Europe in 1992 on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). This game featured the series trademark hero, Link, on a quest to save the Princess of Hyrule, Zelda, who had been kidnapped by the evil wizard Agahnim. The game marked a return to the series' 2D overhead roots, which Zelda II: The Adventure of Link departed from. It is considered by many to be the best game in the series, though it is not quite as popular as Ocarina of Time.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Link battling Agahnim.[CR]The story of Link to the Past follows a young boy named Link who is contacted by a princess named Zelda. After rescuing her from a wizard named Agahnim, Link sets out upon a quest to retrieve the Master Sword and three mystical pendants. With the Master Sword eventually in-hand, Link defeats Agahnim, but is subsequently teleported into the Dark World version of Hyrule. Once there, Link sets off to find and defeat Agahnim yet again, but must first find the seven descendants of the Seven Sages throughout temples in the Dark World. After freeing the descendants throughout the Dark World, Link does battle with the Agahnim, and upon defeating him finds Ganon where Agahnim's remains lie. The final battle against Ganon ensues.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]World map of the Dark World.[CR]A major concept in Link to the Past is that a dark version of everything in Hyrule exists in a realm known as the "Dark World". This world was once a Sacred Realm until Ganon arrived and used the Triforce to bend the realm to his will, covering the land with darkness and despair. Throughout the course of the game, Link must travel between the Light World and the Dark World in order to complete certain puzzles and progress through the game's story. Some areas of the Light and Dark worlds are identical, but others have minute differences that alter Link's ability to travel through them. At first, Link is transformed into a reflection of his inner self whenever entering the Dark World, which leaves him unable to use items or wield a sword and shield, but eventually he collects an item that allows him to maintain his form while traveling through the Dark World (much to the surprise of the world's natural inhabitants).World Map of the Light World.[CR]About half of the game takes place in the Light World. Link must win three pendants in order to obtain the Master Sword, as well as defeat Agahnim at the top of Hyrule Castle. Most of the second half of the game takes place in the Dark World, where Link must revisit the seven temples which differ from their Light World counterparts significantly. While traversing the Dark World dungeons, it is sometimes necessary to travel to the Light World to manipulate an object, and then return to the Dark World where a consequence of that manipulation will allow Link to progress further. An example of this can be found when traversing the Dark World's water temple, as Link must first open two flood switches in the Light World's counterpart in order to allow him to venture further.[CR]While this " parallel world" mechanic made its first appearance in Link to the Past, it certainly wasn't the last Zelda game to use it. Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess both included the ability to travel between parallel worlds, and many believe that this mechanic played a significant role in the success of each of these Zelda games.[CR]The structure of the game adheres to the formula of the series, of which this game is the prime example. Exploration of the towns and overworld is broken up by dungeon exploration, which involves solving puzzles and facing enemies, including a boss and a miniboss. In each dungeon, Link will find a new item that will allow him to solve puzzles or reach new areas, while also providing a key role in besting that dugeon's boss.[CR]Equipment[CR]SwordsFighters SwordMaster SwordTempered SwordGolden SwordShieldsLink's tunicThe Blue Shield protects against arrows and rocks. It can be eaten by Like Likes/Pickit Plants.The Red Shield is an upgrade of the Blue Shield and protects against fireballs. It can also be eaten by monsters.The Mirror Shield is the final upgrade to the shield. It can protect against lasers, and is unable to be eaten by monsters.ArmorThe Green Tunic is Link's initial armor and provides no extra protection.The Blue Mail reduces damage taken by 25%.The Red Mail reduces damage taken by 50%.Pegasus Shoes[CR]These shoes (renamed boots in the GBA version) allow Link to perform a dash. He will continue to run in a straight line until the player stops him or he crashes into an obstacle. The resulting crash can be used to break down certain walls or cause items to appear.GlovesThe Power Glove allows Link to lift light-colored rocks.The Titan's Mitt allows Link to lift dark-colored rocks.Zora's Flippers[CR]These flippers allow Link to swim. His purchase of these flippers also allows him to use whirlpools as warp points.Moon Pearl[CR]Possession of this mystical artifact allows the owner to keep his true form in the Dark World. If Link does not possess this item when entering the Dark World, he will become a pink bunny.[CR]Items[CR]Fire RodLanternBoomerangBombBottleBug Collecting NetThe Book of MudoraBowMushroomsMagical PowderMagical MirrorMagic HammerHook ShotShovelFlute (Ocarina in GBA version)Ice RodFire RodEtherBombosQuakeStaff of SomariaStaff of ByrnaMagic Cape[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Lemmings</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The first level - 'Just Dig'.Originally an Amiga exclusive, developed by DMA design (later becoming Rockstar North) was met with an exceptional reception and was quickly ported to many different platforms. A puzzle game that requires players to direct a group of green haired, blue-shirted, lemmings from point A to point B. The game is based on the myth that lemmings migrate in large groups and follow a single leader, who would often lead them off a cliff to their demise. In the game, lemmings constantly march in one direction unless they run into an obstacle, at which point they turn around and walk the other way. Being fearless and unaware of their own mortality, the lemmings will blindly run into fire, jump off cliffs, become crushed and fall victim to numerous other pitfalls.The player must command the lemmings to do certain tasks in order to complete each stage and get a certain percentage of lemmings to safety. These actions include digging, using a pick axe to dig diagonally, using their arms (windmill style) to punch horizontally through terrain and building staircases to traverse large gaps.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]All levels in Lemmings consist of at least one entrance, and at least one exit. The aim in each level is to safely get an allocated amount of lemmings towards an exit. Obstacles; such as water, deadly traps and great heights will hinder the lemmings' progress.There are 120 levels in total, split into four difficulty ratings - Fun, Tricky, Taxing, and Mayhem.[CR][B]Skills:[/B][CR]There are eight different skills available for the lemmings to carry out. Each level has a different selection and amount of abilities available. Different situations require the use of different skills.Several lemmings using the 'floater' skill.The skills are:Climbers - Climbers will climb a vertical surface until they reach the end of the surface.Diggers - Diggers will dig downward vertically through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Miners - These will dig diagonally downward through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Bashers - Will dig horizontally through a wall made of any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Builders - Will build a 12 step stairway diagonally upwards.Blockers - Will stop walking and block the advances of other lemmings, causing them to reverse their course.Bombers - A countdown will appear above their head, counting from 5 to 0. Upon reaching zero, they will explode.Floaters - Using an umbrella, these lemmings will float down a long drop.Lemmings being nuked.Three other types of commands can be used by the player, these are:Drop rate - The player may increase and decrease the rate in which lemmings fall from the entrance.Pause - The player may temporarily halt the game, this mode can be used to select skills without using any extra time on the clock.Nuke - If the player has reached a dead end and cannot finish the level then this button can be clicked in order to blow up every lemming on the screen.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Lemmings 2 - The Tribes</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lemmings 2: Tribes is the sequel to DMA Design's earlier puzzle hit Lemmings and takes its name from the 12 tribes of lemmings that inhabit the island on which the game takes place. The island is divided into twelve regions, one for each tribe. Some tribes differ in color, but all are controlled in the same way. Some abilities are specific to certain tribes, while others are reused several times.[CR]The land of each tribe has its own visual style and music, and some unique challenges.[CR]Psygnosis published the game in the US and Europe. SunSoft would produce the Japanese console versions, as they had with Lemmings.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Land of the Lemmings[CR]The game features 120 levels split equally between the 12 tribes. When the 10 levels of any tribe are complete, a segment of a talisman is awarded. When all 12 pieces of talisman are united, the island of the lemmings will be saved.[CR]Over 50 types of lemming are featured in Tribes, compared to just 8 of the original game.[CR]Each Tribe starts with 60 lemmings. In a significant departure from other Lemmings games, rather than have a 'fresh set' of lemmings for each level and a target number to save, only one lemming has to reach the exit to pass the level. However, only lemmings that survived could proceed to the next level, which might lead to the player having insufficient lemmings to complete a particular stage, requiring earlier levels to be replayed. Gold, silver and Bronze are awarded for each level, gold being required to unlock a finishing animated video.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] additions not related to the lemmings themselves include hazards and challenges specific to each environment, and the interface features an additional 'fan' icon, which allows drifting lemmings to be blown along.[CR]Levels are generally more interactive with elements such as rope swings, catapults and trampolines.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The Tribes of Lemmings 2:Polar bea... err LemmingA day at the beachPolarHighlandCircusClassicOutdoorEgyptianBeachMedievalSportsShadowPrehistoric (aka Cavelem)SpaceThe Lemmings of the Twelve TribesArcherAttractorBalloonerBasher*BazookaBlocker*Bomber*BooterBuilder*Climber*Club BasherDigger*DiverExploderFencerFillerFlamethrowerFloater*Glue PourerHang GliderHopperIcarus WingsJetpackJumperKayakerLaser BlasterMagic CarpetMiner*MortarParachuterPlanterPlatformerPole-vaulterRock ClimberRollerRoperRunnerSand PourerScooperShimmierSkaterSkierSliderSpearerStackerStomperSuper LemmingSurferSwimmerThrowerTwisterWalker[CR]*returning from the original Lemmings.

				<title_clean>Lester the Unlikely</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lester the Unlikely is a side-scrolling platformer that uses a similar rotoscoping animation format seen in platformers such as Another World or Prince of Persia. Lester moves awkwardly and must carefully climb up high ledges and take small drops in order to avoid injury. He gradually becomes more confident in himself as the game progresses and becomes more effective at the platforming elements. He'll also stop being scared of creatures he encounters, walking past them or fighting them instead of screaming and running away.[CR]Lester the Unlikely was released exclusively on the Super Nintendo in 1994.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The "kind of geeky" and "kind of sleepy" hero Lester recently acquired the latest issue of his favorite comic book "Super Duper Hero Squad". While reading his new comic and walking along the docks, Lester soon falls asleep next to a cargo crate next to a nearby cargo ship. While asleep, Lester is loaded onto the ship with the the cargo by a crane and the ship sets sail along with Lester aboard. While on the sea, the cargo ship is hijacked by pirates, and in the chaos, begins to sink. Luckily our hero discovers a life jacket and swims to shore on an adjacent island. Now lost and stranded on an unknown island, Lester must search for someone or something that can help him survive and find his way home.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Lethal Enforcers</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lethal Enforcers was first released into American arcades by Konami on Oct. 14, 1992. Considered to be the first in the police simulator sub-genre of light-gun shooters, it, along with Mad Dog McCree and Terminator 2: Judgement Day, became wildly popular in arcades and ushered in a Golden Age for light-gun shooters. The success of Lethal Enforcers led to the development of franchises such as Virtua Cop and Time Crisis, both of which borrow heavily from the game's core design and concepts.[CR]The player takes the role of a police officer from Chicago named Don Marshall, who battles a major crime syndicate that has invaded the city (with a "partner" if played with 2 players) through 5 levels. The stages, in order, are "The Bank Robbery", "Chinatown Assault", "The Hijackers", "Drug Dealers", and "Chemical Plant". In each stage, Don has to shoot criminals that pop out of the scenery before they shot him. Occasionally an innocent civilian appears instead, and by shooting them Don loses health and penalizes the player's final score. Don can collect additional weapons throughout the level that are more powerful than his standard gun, such as a magnum or shotgun, but they are lost if hit.[CR]In the Arcades, players used a plastic revolver-like light-gun to play the game, called the "Konami Justifier". The gun was colored blue for Player 1 and pink for Player 2. The standard gun in the game has 6 shots, and to reload the gun players has to fire the trigger off-screen. On home versions of the game, players can use a gun that is bundled with the game, or a standard controller.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Lethal Weapon</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lethal Weapon is an action platformer game from Eurocom and was created to coincide with the third Lethal Weapon movie, which was released the same year. The cover art is taken from the movie poster for Lethal Weapon 3. The game includes elements from the movie (such as the antagonist Jack Travis and Joe Pesci's returning comic relief character Leo Getz) but doesn't closely follow the plot.NES and Game Boy Version[CR]This version is a side-scroller brawler/shooter in which the player assumes either Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson's character) or Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover's character) and fights through hordes of criminals with their guns and fists. The player can also throw grenades should they find any, which can clear out small groups of enemies at once.Super Nintendo Version[CR]In this platformer, the player controls either both Riggs and Murtaugh - Riggs fires faster and Murtaugh jumps higher (presumably no offense was meant) - and plays through five missions set in different locations. The fifth and final stage has the duo arrest Jack Travis and recover the stolen weapons around which the movie focuses.[CR]Test edit. [CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Liberty or Death</title_clean>
				<plot>"History CAN be fun!"[CR]For those of you who haven't figured it out already from the title, this game is about the Revolutionary War. I'm writing this review because I feel that the other reviews did not explain the details of the game well enough and had a number of glaring mistakes.[CR]Liberty or death is a strategy/simulation game based on our war for independence. It was published by KOEI in 1994. At the time, KOEI was the premier simulation game developer. They also produced the Uncharted Waters series, the Romance of Three Kingdoms, and Heroes of Might and Magic. (Uncharted Waters is yet another masterful simulator)I am of the strong opinion that Liberty or Death was their best work, and is a must have for anyone willing to take the time to learn its complex game mechanics. Without further adieu, the review.[CR]Concept: 9/10 This game really was the first of its kind. It's unprecedented depth set a new standard for the genre.[CR]Graphics: 6/10 Certainly not the game's strongpoint. The visuals aren't an eyesore, but there's nothing that will wow you either. Every single character in the game (there's at least 200 of them if you count gov't officials) has his own picture, which adds a bit of flare.[CR]Sound: 7/10 I have mixed feelings about this games sound. The gunfire, cavalry charges and explosions were only okay. The music in this game was really great. The various* songs were well written and truly capture the revolutionary spirit. They make you feel as though you've been transported back in time. The problem- there aren't enough of them. This game has about eight songs, if you count the intro and menu tracks. This may get slightly annoying, but you're usually so deep into formulating your stratagems and improving your army you won't particularly care. The music shouldn't be the focus of this type of game anyway.[CR]Playability: 8/10 For those of you who read the review that said the menus only featured graphics and were too confusing to navigate, do not fear. The menus have NO graphics and are all text. (At least I can say that for the SNES version, I don't know about Genesis.) The first time you plunge into this game, you WILL have some trouble. As I said earlier, this game is very thick with options, and the menus feature a lot of choices. Fortunately, they are easy to navigate. You may be a bit confused for the first few hours of play, but the menus will be second nature to you after a few hours. If this makes you feel any better, I learned to play this game without the aid of an instruction manual. (Which is over 60 pgs, by the way.) In fact, it's better to disregard the instructions. You'll just be confused, and you learn almost everything after 8-12 hrs. (Though there are some details the instructions are good for.) Battles are also easy to pick up.[CR]With a little patience, this game is very enjoyable and rewarding experience.[CR]Entertainment: 9/10 This is where it's at. Note that the score you see comes from a history buff. If you don't like history but enjoy strategy, pick this title up regardless. Don't shy away from LoD because it seems complex. Pease trust me in that you will get into the thick of things quickly. I had countless hours of fun with it, and you will too. I constantly found myself addicted and couldn't put the controller down. Prepare to kiss away hours of your life after plugging this one into your console. LoD is a rarity in stores these days, but if you shop around, I guarantee you'll find a copy. I also have it for computer emulator, so it can be found online as well.[CR]Replay Value: 6/10 You will play this game at least twice, one time for each side. Actually, you'll play more than that as your first few forays into LoD will invariably end in failure. (Remember, in a strat game of this caliber you can't expect to win unless you learn and use all tools at your disposal, which as I said will take a few hours.) You also may want to attempt the game on the ''Hard'' difficulty setting for further challenge. (Darn near impossible, as the AI in this game is very advanced and takes advantage of all opportunities to win that you throw at it.)[CR]Final Words: This section outlines all of my thoughts and opinions that didn't fall into the above categories. As said in other reviews, the game is much harder to win with the British. (I've done it though)In fact, the Brits only have seven truly capable commanders. (Fortunately one of those seven is the best in the entire game.) The Americans will often get many more regiments and overwhelm the British forces. Here's a quick synopsis of the advantages of both sides. British: Better armed troops, more money (to start with, at least. The amount you get later depends on how much territory you control.), lots of naval support. Americans: Better commanders, larger army, easily gains initial control of northern colonies.[CR]That's about all there is to say. If this review sparked even an inkling of your interest, try to find this game. It's a true strategy masterpiece, and a testament to history actually being fun.[CR]Reviewer's Score: 8/10, Originally Posted: 04/16/03, Updated 04/16/03[CR]Reviewer: pubbisk[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/snes/review/R52116.html[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Lost Vikings 2</title_clean>
				<plot>What has gone before...[CR]It's not every day that three Viking warriors find themselves imprisoned aboard an alien spaceship... and it's certainly not every day that three Viking warriors trounce their alien kidnapper and come swaggering home in triumph. It was some time before Olaf, Baleog, and Erik's egos deflated, but eventually life returned to normal in their small northern village.[CR]Or nearly so - for after their wild extraterrestrial adventures, the three brothers found themselves discontented with their former calm Viking lives...[CR]Dissatisfied with his job as senior polar bear wrangler, Baleog the Fierce auditioned for the Nordic Gladiators but stomped out in disgust when he was barred from bringing his own weaponry. It was then that Baleog realized his responsibility to pass on his skills to the next generation of Vikings. He formed Baleog's School of Plunder, with a popular curriculum focusing on Pillaging, Plundering, and Setting Things On Fire. He became famous throughout Scandinavia for a brilliant lecture course entitled Geat-Crushing In Three Easy Steps. ("Step One: Select a Geat. Step Two: Aim high. Step Three: Crush.") He then went on a tour promoting his book Stalking The Wild Geat and its wildly successful sequel Just What IS A Geat, Anyway?[CR]Olaf the Stout decided to pursue his dream of becoming a sumo wrestler and set off in search of the Land of the Rising Sun. He made it as far as the Land of the Noonish Sun before he turned back - not because the journey was too tough but because he couldn't find lasagna anywhere beyond the Mediterranean. Instead, he returned sheepishly home to his family and devoted himself to instructing his children in the arts of swordsmanship, looting, thundering, and making decent goat cheese. Both of his daughters now attend the Baleog School of Plunder- Olaf is especially proud of his eldest, Gerda, who has achieved the rank of Honorary Valkyrie AND can out eat her dad any day of the week. Olaf has appeared on "Lifestyles Of The Large &amp; Bearded" and is busy working on a Combat Frisbee, although the neighbors insist that the idea will never fly.[CR]Erik the Swift's experiences in outer space left him bored with village life. He ended up with the mystic Order of the Leaping Mountain Goat, where he finally learned peace, enlightenment, and how to eat a tin can whole. In fact, Erik emptied his mind so thoroughly that he then spent months wandering around dazed and confused, sculpting fjords out of mashed potatoes and believing he was an iguana. He regained his memory after several knocks on the head, all self-inflicted whilst attempting to ram open a can of tuna: --KANG! KANG!-- "Wait a minute! I'm not an iguana at all!" --KANG! KANG!- "Heeey, I'm Erik the Swift!" He swiped a ship and hurried home to the village, where he was warmly greeted by his brothers... especially Olaf, who was thrilled to discover that his own journey had NOT been the most ridiculous one in the history of the village, after all.[CR]Early one fine Thor's-Day morning the three brothers set out together in their ship, the Ragnarok. Baleog wanted to do a little light plundering, Olaf felt like fishing. The argument was settled peacefully when Erik wisely sided with Olaf... that is, after Olaf threatened to pick him up by the braids and throw him overboard. After some good-natured brawling on the foredeck, the trio settled down to enjoy the cold, clear morning, and to wait for the sun to rise so that they could bait the fishing lines without sticking hooks through their fingers in the darkness.[CR]Little do our heroes know that a specter from their past is stalking them high above. No, it isn't the Master of the Order of the Leaping Mountain Goat... it's Tomator, their alien captor of years before! Though their last encounter was only a year ago for Olaf, Baleog, and Erik, to the time-travelling Tomator his stinging defeat at the brothers' hands occurred only last week... and he wants revenge.[CR]Fortunately, for an alien evil genius, Tomator is pretty sloppy. Once again, his ship malfunctions just as the three Norsemen are in his grasp... and this time, the Viking brothers are ready. They've grabbed some of Tomator's high-tech equipment and they know exactly what they have to do to get back to their homes and families: find Tomator and beat the snot out of him![CR]Will the Vikings find their way home across time and space? Will Erik lead his brothers to safety without bonking himself back into thinking he's an iguana? Will Olaf be reunited with his wife and daughters? Will Baleog ever to get a date with Freya, that Valkyrie babe on the "Resume Game" screen? Stay tuned...[CR]--From the SNES Lost Vikings 2 instruction manual.[CR][B]Overview:[/B]:[CR]The Lost Vikings 2 is a great addition to the series. The vikings come back with more cool stuff than ever. Not to mention the addition of two new characters. The game-play and graphics are almost the same as the original Lost Vikings game. The basic premise of the game is to use the special abilities of each of the vikings in order to help everyone through the maze which is each level.[CR]I loved this game, it was very fun to play alone or with a friend. So I say give Lost Vikings 2 a chance, you won't regret it.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]In The Lost Vikings 2 use all of their abilities to solve the puzzles, and help them find their way home.

				<title_clean>Lost Vikings, The</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The main characters are three Vikings, Erik the Swift, Baleog the Fierce, and Olaf the Stout. The goal is to guide all Vikings safely through each level. The game's originality is due to the fact that the player controls three different characters (although only one at any given time), and must make use of their individual abilities and their combination to solve puzzles and progress. The game featured infinite opportunities of retries in case the player were to lose one of the Vikings. Much of the game's appeal came from the humorous inter-level dialogues of the characters.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The three vikings[CR]This game sets players with the task of completing each level by using 3 different characters. This requires the use of each Viking's abilities as well as getting them all to the area's exit point alive.[CR]Erik the Swift - As his name states, he is very agile being the only one of the three that can run or jump. That fact alone makes him invaluable in a platformer but, additionally, if he gets a large enough start he can do a speeding charge helmet first into things. It will damage enemies but it's main use is in destroying breakable walls.[CR]Baleog the Fierce - He lives up to the name by being the main fighter. He has a sword to strike down enemies and a longbow to kill from afar. His bow serves the dual purpose of being able to activate buttons from a distance. In certain stages, Baelog is able to set his arrows on fire to solve various puzzles.[CR]Olaf the Stout - He carries on him a large round shield as tall as himself which lets him stop almost any attack. This can halt approaching enemies, or protect the vikings from any oncoming projectiles. His shield can also be lifted above his head. Not only will this work as a platform allowing Erik a higher jump from, but it manages to serve as a hang glider for Olaf, allowing his stout frame to float through the air.[CR]Areas[CR]The game consists of 36 stages, divided into several chapters, each with a different theme.Stages 1-4: The vikings attempt to escape from the alien shipStages 5-11: The vikings are in prehistoric Earth, fighting dinosaurs and cave-menStages 12-17: The vikings are in ancient Egypt, and now have to contend enemies which are able to leap over Olaf's shield, as well as poisonous insects.Stages 18-25: The vikings are in a modern factory, and must navigate more automated environmental hazards.Stages 26-33: The vikings are in "Wonderland", and area that operates off of cartoon physics.Stages 34-36: The vikings are back on the alien ship and must now fight Tomator, the leader of the aliens.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When released, Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 6,8,8,8, adding, "Another excellent job from Interplay! Once you play, you're greeted with excellent soundtracks and plenty of bass! The puzzles get very difficult but are not frustrating. The Viking characters have their own personalities complete with comical antics. This game is a definite must-get".[CR]Starcraft II Tribute[CR]The Hyperion's bar in Starcraft II has an arcade machine named "The Lost Viking". It's a shoot'em up where players take control of a lost spaceship (named 'Viking' after the SC2 Terran unit) trying to get home.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Skip (Japanese Version)[CR]Enter [B]MOMY[/B] as a password, then press [B]A+B+X+Y[/B] during gameplay.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Japanese Version Passwords[CR]The password system in the Japanese version contains vowels instead of numbers. Thus, all passwords that have numbers in the International versions were altered due to this. Any level not listed below has the same password in all versions.</plot>

				<title_clean>Lufia &amp; the Fortress of Doom</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lufia &amp; the Fortress of Doom was developed by  Neverland Co., Ltd. and published by  Taito Corporation for the SNES in December 1993. It is the first installment in the Lufia series. The game follows the traditional role-playing game formula of the era and contains a lot of basic RPG elements. Lufia &amp; the Fortress of Doom gathered enough of a loyal following to warrant the production of more sequels, including the prequel Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals which reveals the events leading up to the first game's prologue.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story begins with a prologue centering around a time in which four evil Sinistrals named Daos, Amon, Erim, and Gades plan on spreading terror and chaos throughout the world. The Sinistrals were located on a floating island called the Fortress of Doom which more or less served as their headquarters. During that time, four brave souls became the world's last ray of hope and accepted the challenge of trying to stop the Sinistals; these heroes were known as Maxim, Selan,  Artea, and Guy. The heroes ventured forth to the Fortress of Doom to attempt to defeat the evil Sinistrals and eventually succeeded. After the Sinistrals were defeated, the floating island started to collapse. Weak from the battle, Selan didn't have enough strength to walk, and Maxim refused to leave her side. Artea and Guy became separated from them and escaped just before the island collapsed; however, Maxim and Selan weren't so lucky and perished.The fortress of doom[CR]Fast-forward into the future and the player is introduced to a mysterious girl named Lufia, as well as the nameless Hero of the story who also happens to be a descendant of Maxim. The two grow up with each other in the small town of Alekia, and become close childhood friends. After ninety-nine years of peace, the nearby kingdom of Sheran is viciously attacked by monsters. As events begin to unfold, a rumor springs forth that the commander of the monstrous army who ordered the attack fits the description of the late Sinistral, Gades.[CR]Being a descendant from the great Maxim, the hero takes it upon himself to investigate the attack in Sheran to confirm the validity of the rumors. Gades was indeed behind the attack and is still in Sheran where the Hero meets and confronts him. The Hero engages in a fierce battle with the Sinistral, is easily defeated, and barely survives. Knowing the Sinistrals are still alive, the Hero sets out on a long journey to rid the world once again of the evil Sinistrals. He is joined by Lufia, whose mysterious past begins to unfold as the story progresses, and two others named Aguro and Jerin who he meets along the way.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The four main characters The Hero - The main protagonist in the story and a descendant of the great Maxim who defeated the Sinistrals long ago. He is a skilled swordsman who grew up in Alekia with his childhood friend Lufia. Lufia - She came to Alekia at a young age not knowing anything about her past or who her parents were. She became very close friends with the Hero; so close she would do anything for him. She has a very mysterious background that no one knows about.Aguro - He is the commander of the Lorbenian army. He meets the Hero and Lufia during their journey and eventually decides to join them in their quest to save the world from the evil Sinistrals.Jerin - A young half-elf who was about to be sacraficed when she was saved by the Hero and the rest of his party. She later decides to join them in their quest to save the world.SinistralsGades - The Sinistral of Destruction. He has a penchant for destroying everything in his path.Amon - The Sinistral of Terror. His purpose is to instill fear into those who cross his path. In later games, Amon is referred to as the Sinistral of Chaos. The mutated Guard DaosErim - The Sinistral of Death. She controls life and death, and has the ability to resurrect the other Sinistrals. As long as she lives, the other Sinistrals can always be brought back to life.Daos - The Sinistral of Chaos. He is the leader of the four Sinistrals. In later games, Daos is referred to as the Sinistral of Terror.Guard Daos - A powerful, mutated creature that is the result of Gades, Amon, and Daos combining forces to become one entity. Erim is excluded from the mix.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]This game is pretty straightforward and contains many traditional RPG elements. The player moves the characters around a world map entering towns and other various places where they can talk to people, collect items, buy equipment, and perform tasks to aid them in their overall mission of saving the world. Characters become stronger by leveling up when they earn enough experience through winning battles, which in turn unlocks new abilities and boosts several attributes.[CR]Battles occur randomly in hostile areas or in certain situations where it's part of the story such as a boss encounter. When a battle does occur, the player is taken to a turn-based battle screen where they have several options to choose from: attack, magic, item, defend, and run. Battles are similar to traditional RPG games; however, there is an actual strategy involved where the player must keep track of enemy hit points because if they don't they may end up wasting turns doing an &#8220;overkill&#8221;. For instance, if an enemy dies at the hands of Aguro and is still targeted that same turn by Lufia, Lufia still attacks that spot even though the enemy is dead, resulting in a miss.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Free Stay at the Inn[CR]If you go to the inn with less gold than what the inn keeper charges, your stay will be free.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] "Try Again" mode[CR]Beat the game in normal mode to unlock "Try Again" mode. [CR]Select this option to start a new game where you will receive 4 times as much experience and gold from enemies.</plot>

				<title_clean>Lufia II - Rise of the Sinistrals</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lufia II has players take control of Maxim, wielder of the Dual Blade and leader of the four warriors who first defeated the Sinistrals. The story of this battle is told in the opening scene of Lufia &amp; The Fortress of Doom. The game follows Maxim's beginnings as a monster hunter, through meeting the other three warriors, to the final battle against the Sinistrals. It has a mixture of traditional turn-based combat and puzzle solving.[CR]In 2009, Square-Enix announced that Lufia II would be remade as Estpolis: The Lands Cursed by the Gods for the DS, and also noted that the majority of the original development team from Neverland Co. is intact and will be working on Estpolis.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]In the opening scene we are told that the time has come for the Dual Blade to decide whether the Sinistrals or humans should rule the world. Erim, the sinistral of death, is sent to find the dual blade and see who should be in control. After that, you begin playing as Maxim, a Monster hunter in the town of Elcid. He hunts down monsters around town for a fee, and is paid by the local shop owner Tia. One Day a large ball of light streaks across the sky to the north. Maxim goes to investigate and discovers that the way north was blocked by monsters. After fighting them he is approached by a woman named Iris who tells him of the Sinistrals and his destiny to face them. From there they begin their journey to find the dual blade, and defeat the Sinistrals. Several party members are only temporary until the final four come together, but the other playable characters continue to have impact on the plot even after their departure.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]When in a dungeon Maxim and all enemies are represented by moving sprites. For every step Maxim takes the enemies move a set amount, and in a set pattern, based on what they are. Making contact with an enemy initiates battle. Depending on Maxim's orientation when he touches an enemy the player may end up with a preemptive strike or be ambushed. This is why when navigating the dungeon it is important to be cautious and plan out how to approach the enemy, especially in particularly crowded rooms. Players can also use some of the puzzle-solving items to stop an enemy's movement for a specific number of steps.[CR]Combat is turn-based, but includes ideas such as the IP ("Item Points" or "Ikari Points") gauge, which is perhaps similar to early versions of the Limit Break. The IP gauge fills up when attacked, and some pieces of equipment can convert this power into a special ability, ranging from powerful attacks to unorthodox healing spells. The most unique aspect of combat is that all spells can have any number of targets, but more targets decreases the magic's potency. This gives flexibility; a spell can focus on one enemy or attack everything except the monster that can reflect magic. The maximum number of characters available in combat is four, and there is no choice between party members offered; it is guided by the storyline. There are also creatures in the game world called Capsule Monsters. Only one of these at a time can join the other characters in battle, and they cannot be controlled.Puzzles[CR]The dungeons are also riddled with a variety of switch, explosive, and positioning based puzzles that can be very interesting. When solving these puzzles you are given various items to help out:ItemDescriptionResetThis restores the room to its original state, thereby rectifying mistakes on puzzles such as pushing a block into a corner.ArrowUseful for flipping switches at a distance, they also stun enemies for a certain number of steps.BombThis standard bomb destroys vulnerable walls and debris within its blast radius, though later some things are un-bombable.Fire ArrowFire arrows function as normal arrows with the additional advantage of setting anything it touches aflame; this is useful for cutting down large amounts of grass quickly. Some puzzles are based around destroying regenerating grass.HookLike the Hookshot of Legend of Zelda fame, the hook enables Maxim to attach to objects in order to cross gaps. It also stuns enemies.HammerDestroys rocks and bombable things from a distance, also pushes heavy objects that might be unreachable.[CR]These items are given to Maxim through the normal progression of the story and are required for progression through dungeons and puzzles. The puzzles are initially simple but can become very difficult later in the game.Capsule Monsters[CR]Capsule monsters are creatures Maxim discovers that joins his party in battle. They have levels, abilities, and also multiple forms. In order to reach a new form, the capsule monster must be given items. They request special items that work more effectively than average items, but feeding them high-end items may spoil their palate and result in them constantly demanding expensive items. In order to grow into their final form they require a unique item whose sole use is to level up the capsule monster.[CR]Ancient Cave[CR]One of the more prominent features of Lufia II was the Ancient Cave, a dungeon consisting of 98 randomly generated floors, culminating in a boss at the 99th floor of the basement. The players' characters and Capsule Monsters are stripped of their items and reverted to level 1 upon entering the Ancient Cave. There are no save points and a descent to the 99th floor could take several hours; the only form of exit is an item called Providence. Providence is supposedly found on the 20th floor, but in reality can be located anywhere from floors 20-30, and occasionally slightly lower than that. If the player misses Providence on one floor, it will reappear later; if the player throws away Providence, it appears in the player's inventory after fighting the boss on the 99th floor.[CR]The main attraction of the Ancient Cave is the powerful equipment that could be used permanently inside and outside of the Ancient Cave, and remained with characters even upon re-entry. The majority of these items are extremely powerful and are still useful up to and including the final boss and endgame side quests. These "blue chest items", which appeared in ornate blue chests rather than the standard red, are the key to reaching the 99th floor and killing the boss.[CR]The final boss of the ancient cave is a giant, red jelly; this is an ironic boss because Red Jellies are the weakest monsters in the game. The Giant Jelly does not attack at all; instead, it heals the player's characters, and escapes the battle if its large health bar is not depleted by the end of the player's third turn, denying access to the Ancient Cave's final rewards. These final rewards are three pieces of armor that are not extraordinarily strong, but are still the best available for their slot.[CR]Upon beating the game twice, "Gift Mode" becomes available. This mode places Maxim on the island where the Ancient Cave is located with no means of leaving. The player can pick and choose any possible combination from the game's cast to enter the Cave, allowing for more possibilities with one's play-style. Maxim can even enter the cave alone if the player chooses to do so.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]1 - Deep Blue2 - The Whole Silent World3 - Over the Sky4 - The Land Nobody Knew5 - The Turret Forgotten6 - The Fortress of Doom7 - The Last Duel8 - Four Masters of Doom9 - Battle Theme #310 - Grief11 - For the Savior12 - Ending13 - Pulifia14 - Departure15 - The Memory of Last War16 - The Last Duel #217 - Holy Victim18 - Main Theme19 - Theme of Town20 - Buoyant &amp; Cheerful21 - Sweet Dreams22 - Pulifia #223 - Theme of Castle24 - The Earth25 - Battle Theme #126 - Theme of Village27 - Triumph28 - Theme of Cave29 - The Ruins of Dread30 - Vicious Wind31 - Battle Theme #232 - Theme of Port Town33 - The Sorrow of Parting34 - New World35 - Theme of Tower36 - The Gate For Journey37 - Lairl Lab38 - Blue Field39 - Quiet Shrine40 - Under Market41 - Game Over42 - To the Sky43 - The Fortress of Doom #244 - Four Masters of Doom #245 - Battle Theme #346 - Field Motif47 - Again And48 - Ending #2[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Capsule leveling up.[CR]To do this, feed any Capsule Monster a Long Knife (purchasable at any store early on) Now, save the game. Use the soft reset (l+R+start+select) When you load, instead of requiring a rarer item for the next feeding, you'll only have to use another Long Knife. This is an apparent glitch tht resets the list of items needed to level up monsters.

In Gift Mode, you can select your own party which is only really useful for the Ancient Dungeon.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Egg Dragon[CR]To defeat the Egg Dragon in less than one round, you only need: A healing item/spell and enough hit points to survive his attack.[CR]First, you just heal him and then attack him once and he will die.[CR]This is because he has max possible hp and the programmers forgot a hp-cap to prevent this.</plot>

				<plot>Madden NFL '94 is the third in the Madden series of football games for the SNES. It features 80 teams -- 28 teams from the 1993 season, 38 Super Bowl teams from 1966-1991, 12 All Star franchise teams since 1950, and two "All-Madden" teams: one for the 1993 season and one from a 20-year time span. You can play these teams in a regular exhibition game or sudden death overtime game, or take the 1993 teams through an entire season.

				<plot>[CR]In Magic Boy the player controls the aptly named "Magic Boy" and has to complete stages by defeating all of the enemies in a given level. The bulk of the gameplay involves platform jumping and shooting pellets out of Magic Boy's wand. When an enemy is hit with the pellets they are stunned and Magic Boy can collect them in his bag. If an enemy is left in the bag too long without the player dumping the enemy then Magic Boy dies a horrible, horrible death.  [CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 6,5,5,6 and 5 out of ten.  Mike Weigand wrote, "Here is another game that has great ideas (like being able to grab stunned enemies and carry them around with you), but they get almost completely lost in the poor control.  The colors are beautiful and very well done".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The player controls an unnamed character - referred to as the "brave one" - through 51 levels to the top of the Dragon's Tower. At the top of the tower, the dark lord Drokmar possesses the Black Orb. The goal is to traverse the tower and stop Drokmar's plan to rule the world with the power of the magic crystal. There are two endings to the game - the ending depends on whether the player embraces or destroys the Black Orb.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]The game is primarily a hack and slash sidescroller but also includes platforming in the form of parallel paths of travel and avoiding ground hazards. As the player progresses, they'll encounter new swords that cause increased damage and have different magic attacks. Most swords are acquired immediately after a boss battle at the end of certain levels. Chests and doors can be opened to reveal items and allies respectively. However, some chests and doors are traps that release enemies or other hazards. Doors also require keys to open, which are collected and stored by the player. Only one ally can travel with the player character at a time, and has its own health and level associated with it. Allies level up with items or by passing over the same type of ally again. The game also features a level select option, allowing the player to skip to level 5, 9, 13, 22, 26, 30, or 33.Secrets[CR]Most levels have at least one hidden chest. A secret chest is invisible unless the player character has the Thief ally, crystal ball item, or they strike it with their sword to open it. Some levels have secret doors that warp the player one or more floors ahead when used. These doors can never be seen until activated.Version Differences[CR]The SNES version of the game removed some enemies from the game and moves one of the bosses to a different floor.

				<title_clean>Mario Is Missing!</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Summary:[/B][CR]Mario is Missing is one of Nintendo's many entries into the "edutainment" genre, and one of the few Nintendo games to feature the Mario brother Luigi as the main playable character.[CR]Mario is Missing is a unique Mario game in that the action does not occur in the Mushroom Kingdom, but rather on terrestrial Earth, set in a time contemporary to the game's release date. The visual style of the game is borrowed its SNES contemporary Super Mario World, from the title's font to the overworld city maps.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Even the greats have bad days.[CR]Mario sets off towards Bowser's castle to stop Bowser's evil plan of covering the world in water by melting Antarctica. It is later discovered that Bowser plans to melt the continent with a large number of hair dryers, purchased with money gained from stolen valuable artifacts from across the Earth.[CR]While Luigi is hesitant to enter Bowser's castle, Mario makes a bold entrance, only to be captured moments later. Luigi must then enter the castle solo, searching through each of the dungeon's warp doors for Mario, while at the same time recovering all of the stolen artifacts from Bowser's loyal Koopas. Upon returning each stolen artifact, more doors to the castle unlock, allowing Luigi to search more places until he eventually reaches Antarctica to save his brother and stop Bowser from his evil plan.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]From the warp doors in Bowser's castle, players are transported to various cities across the world. Here, by the flyers attached to tourist information booths, Luigi discovers that the Koopas have stolen culturally significant artifacts. Luigi is able to speak to other people populating the town, ranging from a professor, to a schoolboy, to a police woman. The player gathers clues to correctly identify the missing artifacts, such as the Sistine Chapel painting, or the Forbidden City. To gather additional clues, Luigi also has access to a computer and telephone, both from which he can learn about the missing artifacts. Luigi can call general information, and also receives calls from Mario from time to time, giving tips on generic gameplay.Save the world, or keep the flute. Hmm...[CR]Players also have access to an overworld map, showing the street connections, as well as Koopa and warp pipe locations. Being in the real world, Luigi is also able to speed up travel by taking a taxi cab across town, or out to hard to reach places, such as Alcatraz Island.[CR]A map showing the entire world, called the Globulator, allows players to control Yoshi, as he hops from continent to continent. When the player places Yoshi on the correct city of Luigi's location, Yoshi appears on the stage with him, and Luigi is able to ride the dinosaur throughout the city. Players will not be able to stomp on Koopas until they have acquired Yoshi.[CR]Once the player has stomped a Koopa to reclaim an artifact, Luigi must take it back to the proper information booth. There, the player will be asked a series of questions by an information attendant, bearing resemblance to Princess Peach. If the player fails a certain number of questions, she will dismiss Luigi as a phony, and he will have to wait until the information booth is reopened to attempt to return the artifact again.[CR]Upon the successful returning and delivery, Luigi takes a picture of the fully restored artifact for his photo album. Players are able to view this photo album at any point in the game, along with the facts learned along the way about the important cultural piece.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>"Mario makes learning fun (no, seriously)"[CR]Yes a 10. This game is just that awesome. I can saythat even though I am 14 (seriously.) This game has it all. It is just that damn amazing. I remember when I was little I would play this for hours. Then I got in trouble and had to sit in the corner. Well, on with the review.[CR]GRAPHICS: 9/10[CR]The graphics are colourful and bright, just like most Mario games. Everything is high in detail, and you can make out everything quite easily. They are not as nice as Donkey Kong Country's but they are still very good.[CR]SOUND/MUSIC: 1/10[CR]O.K, to be honest, the game has no sound. But it scored a 1 because it dosn't go eeeeeeeeeeeeeeee like a lot of my snes games.[CR]CHALLENGE-5/10[CR]I gave the challenge 5/10 because for most people over the age of at least 10, it would be a 1, max. But for preschoolers, they would find it quite challenging, and would give it about a 9-ish, so I chose the score in between 1 and 10.[CR]CONTROLS-10/10[CR]Perfect. They could not be better. They are also very simple, you only have to use 2 buttons. They are also very tight, and not unresponsive or sloppy. A lot of games could learn from this game.[CR]GAMEPLAY-10/10[CR]Okay, here we go. This game is very fun. It actually seems a lot more fun now than when I got it in preschool(weird). In this game you either control mario, Yoshi or Princess Peach.[CR]You move your err, magic hand around the island and solve all the number problems. A good concept. It is a very fun game (especially if you are about 5-7). This game is almost as fun as Super Mario All Stars.[CR]MULTIPLAYER-N/A[CR]Although it would be a very nice feature, there is no multiplayer in this game.[CR]LEARNING-8/10[CR]By ''learning'' I mean how well it teaches young kids. It does well. For some reason Mario seams to tach them a lot more than any school could.But it would be better if there was sound. There are several different islands, all with there own fun learning activity.[CR]VALUE-5/10[CR]Once again, if you are about 5-7, then I recomend this game. However, if you are older than that I don't recomend this game (unless you are totally insane, like me).[CR]RENT OR BUY-Buy[CR]If you are under 8, I recomend to buy it. If you are over this, rent it.[CR]Graphics- 9[CR]Sound/Music- 1[CR]Challenge- 5[CR]Controls- 10[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]- 10[CR]Multiplayer- N/A[CR]Learning- 8[CR]Value-5[CR]OVERALL-10[CR]If you like this game, I also recomend[CR]Marios early years: Preschool Fun![CR]Marios early years: Fun with letters[CR]Reviewer's Score: 10/10, Originally Posted: 04/29/04[CR]Reviewer: poopawhacka[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/snes/review/R72528.html[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Ah, the easy life. For Mario, that is. And that also describes the game. Too easy. Even for a preschool child it's too easy. I wouldn't even dig this game as a 3 or 4 year old. Although the animations are really catchy. Bottom line: Nintendo made a grave mistake making this game.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mario's Time Machine is an educational game featuring Nintendo's mascot Mario and is part of the Mario Discovery Series, along with Mario is Missing! and the Mario's Early Years trio. Whereas Mario is Missing! taught younger players geography, Mario's Time Machine teaches world history instead. The SNES version was developed by The Software Toolworks in late 1993, and the NES version by Radical Entertainment the following year. There are minor differences between the two versions as a result.[CR]The goal is to take stolen items out of Bowser's museum, time-travel to the time period from which they hail (the location and date are important when imputting coordinates) and piece together information about the artifact and its owner by talking to NPCs from that era before they can be given back.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Title Screen of Mario's Time Machine[CR]Somehow Bowser has gotten a hold of a time machine, called the Timulator. Using the Timulator he goes back in time and steals many important artifacts of history. Bowser places all of these artifacts that he has taken into what he considers to be "the greatest museum of all time." Bowser will then destroy the Timulator after he is done building his collection, and therefore change the course of history forever.[CR]It is up to Mario to stop Browser from completing his collection of artifacts and return them to their respected time eras. If the artifacts are not brought back history will be changed permanently.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The basic gameplay consists of players talking to historic figures and solving basic puzzles in order to return artifacts to their rightful owners. Each object in Bowser's museum has attached to it a basic explanation of a famous historical figure, including the date and location the item was taken from. By imputing these co-ordinates into the Timulator, Mario can travel back to the correct era with the item in tow.[CR]When travelling back in time, players play a brief minigame where Mario travels trough an endless "ocean of time" with many whirlpools, and the objective is to grab enough mushrooms and deposit them into a wave pool in order to succesfully travel back in time. If Mario does not collect enough mushrooms before falling into a whirlpool or has imputed the wrong year/location combo, he travels back to the prehistoric era where he must play a version of Donkey Kong in order to get back to the museum where players can opt to try again.[CR]Once reaching the correct era, Mario can walk around and ask NPCs for hints. Most will provide at least one of the clues necessary to fill in the explanation provided with the item, and once this report is correctly filled in the item is given to its correct owner and the player can move onto the next.NES Version[CR]The NES version is a little different from the original SNES version. In this version, Mario has to fight Koopa Troopas in platforming sequences before being allowed to travel back in time. Mario also has no idea which artifact goes in which period (the SNES version informs the player as soon as they collect one of the artifacts) and must use the NPC hints to figure out which artifact is the right one for each period.[CR]Historical figures[CR]The historical figure that are featured in the game are:Cleopatra VIIElizabeth IFerdinand MagellanIssac NewtonJoan of ArcJohann GutenbergLeonardo de VinciLudwig van BeethovenMahatma GandhiMarco PoloMichelangeloPlatoThomas Alva EdisonThomas JeffersonWilliam Shakespeare[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released in 1993 Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the review scores of 7,7,6 and 7. Danyon Carpenter wrote, "I actually enjoyed Mario is Missing and I expected this one to be the same. Luckily, it is and it offers even more challenging quests than the first. Kiddies may have a tougher time with this one. For all you experienced gamers, the game will seem like a cakewalk, especially the Donkey Kong-like scenes and the surf boarding, but once you start reading those questions you'd better break out the history books".[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Mark Davis' The Fishing Master</title_clean>
				<plot>In Mark Davis' The Fishing Master, the player can take control of fishing legend Mark Davis and fish in five different lakes and even compete in a fishing tournament to win a trophy.[CR]The gameplay is reminiscent of Super Black Bass.  The player picks a location to fish using an overhead map where the player is then taken to a behind the person perspective to cast their reel.  Once the player casts their line, the view will change to a split screen with the original view on the top with a underwater view on the bottom to view the bait and an approaching fish.[CR]Each lake has a different criteria to meet such as a weight limit, time limit, etc., to advance to the next lake and ultimately compete in the major tournament.  Players can also assemble their own set of authentic fishing gear including rods, reels, bait and various equipment.  The game also boasts that the fish in the game act realistically to their real-life counterparts.</plot>

				<plot>Marvel Super Heroes in War of the Gems is a side-scrolling platformer/beat 'em up based on the Infinity Gauntlet storyline from the comics.  Adam Warlock calls on the heroes to recover the 6 Infinity Gems before they are used for evil.[CR]You may choose ones of five heroes: Spider-Man, Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man and Wolverine.  Each one has different stats and abilities.  (i.e. Spider-Man is agile. Hulk is strong, Iron Man can double-jump with his rocket boots, etc.)  Initially you can choose a training area in Avenger headquarters or four levels.  As you complete levels, most open up.  Each hero can be equipped with gems to boost their abilities in each section.  These must be obtained by finding them in the levels.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is fairly similar to X-Men-Mutant Apocalypse.  Combat is all on a 2D plane.  Each hero has basic jumps and attacks and special moves that can be executed with button combinations like quarter-rolls.  Enemies include various villains from the Marvel Universe and evil doubles of various Marvel heroes.</plot>

				<plot>Disney's Donald Duck takes the starring role in this sidescrolling platform game.  As the detective Maui Mallard, he's on the trail of a long lost Idol, which has recently vanished.  Early on, Maui can also switch between his normal self and Ninja Maui, and with all the creepy voodoo enemies he'll encounter throughout his adventure, he's going to need all the help he can get.[CR]As previously mentioned, there are two personalities to Maui, and as a result, two different sets of controls.  Normal Maui carries a bug gun, which can fire a variety of different insect ammo, from basic bugs, to the more powerful lightning and fire bugs.  It's also possible for Maui to combine bugs to pack a more powerful blast at his enemies.[CR]Once Maui starts to find Yin-Yang coins, he'll be able to transform into Ninja Maui.  Ninja Maui has lightning-quick reflexes, and wields a bo staff.  In addition to being handy for whacking enemies, Ninja Maui can also climb between walls by jumping and propping the staff between the walls at the height of his jump.  He can also hook onto duck heads and swing from them to reach areas he normally couldn't.  You'll need to constantly find Yin-Yang coins to fuel your Ninja persona, otherwise you'll run out and transform back to Maui Mallard.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter the passwords at the password screen.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mecarobot Golf is a golf game for the Super Nintendo that incongruously stars a humanoid golf-playing robot in the starring role. The story of the game makes it clear that Eagle, the robot, isn't allowed to play golf professionally despite being better at the sport than any human, so he is given access to a special golf course in order to prove his skills.[CR]The Japanese version of the game is called Serizawa Nobuo no Birdie Try, named for the Japanese golfer Nobuo Serizawa. Because he is far less famous in the West, he was changed to Eagle for the US release.[CR]The game is a traditional golf sim in that it depicts the action from behind the golfer and uses a sliding power meter to indicate the strength of the swing. The player can use the Lesson and Driving Range modes to practice their golfing before heading onto the Competition mode. The player can choose to play as Eagle (Serizawa in the Japanese version) or select between three fictional human avatars.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>You are Gideon Braver Vandenburg, heir to the planet. While you were away, unknown attackers destroyed your home, killed your entire family, and stole the Chalice that you need to win the throne. When you are implicated in your own family's death, you are forced into exile. With a help of an old friend who contributed an old Jenner and some credits, you must become a mercenary. You must travel the Inner Sphere in search of clues to who set you up, and eventually avenge your family and recover the Chalice. You have five years. Good luck and good hunting. [CR]Mechwarrior was the first 3D BattleTech game developed. Dynamix (who later developed the Starsiege series) created it for Activision. You go to a planet and in search of "fixers" who will set up some contracts with the local authorities. The terms are a flat payment and some salvage payments. Some houses are very stingy but they tell you a lot about the mission. Others pay well but may not tell you everything. You can buy/sell/repair 'Mechs, hire/fire pilots, decide which planet to move to, as you try to maintain decent relationships with all five houses of the Inner Sphere, while trying to uncover clues about where you need to go. This ground-breaking game is very replayable, as each mission is randomly generated. There's even some extended campaigns where you run 2-3 missions in a row. [CR](The following is the plot from the SNES version of Mechwarrior.)[CR]You are Herras Ragen. When you were 12 (3017) your father Colonel Joseph T. Ragen, a soldier in the House Davion army, was working to infiltrate and destroy a renegade mercenary cartel called the Dark Wing Lance and he had got in over his head.  Somehow the members of the cartel got the location of your family's house on Redondo leaked to them from an unknown source. Before making their covert strike the lance made an agreement that they would separate for 10 years and maintain an absolute code of secrecy before regrouping again to continue their nefarious operations.[CR]One night the Lance attacked your families home killing everyone inside.  Over at a friend's you heard sounds of explosions. Rushing home you found a roaring inferno of what used to be the home you grew up with your family. Newly orphaned you vowed revenge on whoever had done this.[CR]The year is 3027. Now a young man, you cannot serve House Davion after what happened all those years ago. Now you make your living working as a freelance Mercenary on the planet Galatea selling your services to anyone whose contract will lead you closer to the insidious Dark Wing Lance.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]While playing, pause the game and press the following buttons:</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]MechWarrior 3050 is the second game in the MechWarrior franchise released for the SNES. Unlike the original MechWarrior, this title changed its cockpit perspective to an isometric view similar to contemporary titles like Desert Strike and its sequels, leading to the graphics being completely overhauled from the previous title on the system. It was released on the Sega Genesis as Battletech: A Game of Armored Combat.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game has the player control a Mech outfitted with an arsenal of missiles and energy weapons in missions that take place on a large map. Like the titles in the Strike series, the player can freely roam around and explore the mission's map before tackling the objectives of the stage. The main single player mode in the came is a campaign that tasks them with several objectives spanning various missions. These can be getting to objective points, clearing out enemies, or escorting convoys across the map. One of the major changes to the game is the introduction of a cooperative two player mode where one player controls the bottom half of the Mech to navigate it around the battlefield while the other player controls the top half of the Mech and its arsenal independently.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Cheat Code[CR]Press Down, A, X on the Tiburon screen,  and enter XTRM3K as a password, to play as the enemy mech.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Invincibility[CR]In order to gain invincibility, you must do the following.

				<title_clean>Mega Man 7</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mega Man 7 (also known as Mega Man VII, and known in Japan as Rockman 7: The Confrontation of Fate!!) is a side-scrolling action platformer developed and published by Capcom for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on September 1995.[CR]It is the seventh installment of the original Mega Man series (and the sequel to Mega Man 6). The only installment of the series for the SNES (with the exception of spin-offs Mega Man Soccer and the Japan-exclusive Rockman &amp; Forte), Mega Man 7 introduces the series to "bolts", a collectible currency (dropped by enemies and found scattered throughout levels) that can be used in a store (Big Eddie's Cybernetic Support Shop) to purchase items and upgrades. It also introduces Dr. Light's mechanic/assistant Auto and Mega Man's robotic rival Bass (along with his robotic wolf Treble). Mega Man's robotic bird, Beat, is also given new functionality as he can carry Mega Man out of fatal pitfalls.[CR]Set in the year 20XX, the game takes place a half a year after the events of Mega Man 6 (in which the humanoid robot hero Mega Man defeats the evil roboticist Dr. Wily a sixth time, sending him to prison for his crimes). Despite being imprisoned, Dr. Wily triggers a fail-safe in this lab (by not being in contact with it for six months) which awakens four Robot Masters sent to rescue him. When Mega Man fails to apprehend Dr. Wily (encountering the mysterious robot Bass, along with his dog Treble, who claims to be after Dr. Wily as well), he must venture out to defeat the new Robot Masters and find Dr. Wily.[CR]The game was later released (in North America only) as part of the Mega Man Anniversary Collection compilation for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube on June 23, 2004 and the Xbox on March 15, 2005. An unofficial 8-bit "demake" of Mega Man 7 was finished in 2008, coinciding with the release of the deliberately-retro Mega Man 9. More information can be found here.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Beat[CR]Mega Man 7 is very similar to the previous six titles in the Mega Man franchise, except for several refinements to gameplay. Mega Man 7 was the third Mega Man game to have a store with wares such as items and powerups available for a set amount of "bolts," the currency of the game which can be collected during levels. To access the store, the player must press the select button on the stage select screen. Later games, such as Mega Man IV (Game Boy version), Mega Man V (Game Boy version), Mega Man 8, Mega Man &amp; Bass, and Mega Man 9 also featured the store.[CR]In Slash Man's stage, the character Beat is unlockable upon being rescued. Beat's job, unlike in Mega Man 5 and Mega Man 6 where he attacks enemies, is to rescue Mega Man when he falls into a pit. The player can hold up to four of Beat's whistles, summoning Beat. Beat can also carry Mega Man for a short period of time, but when it runs out, Beat drops him. If Beat drops Mega Man in a pit by accident, or if the player runs out of whistles, then Mega Man loses a life.Bass[CR]Capcom, being the creators of the Street Fighter franchise, slipped in an extra two player versus mode. It is two rounds long and can be accessed by typing a password while holding L and R. When the password is inputted without L and R, it takes the player (fully powered Mega Man) to the very last Wily Level.[CR]The weapons that Mega Man earns from the eight bosses of the game play more of a role in Mega Man 7. For example, the weapons can be use to alter the environment to discover hidden areas for secret items. In Slash Man's stage, the scorch wheel weapon can be use to burn some of the trees that are in the level.[CR]Mega Man 7 also introduces the game with a level, making it the first game in the series to have an introductory level. This level serves as the introduction of the story, and shows new characters Bass and Treble, who serve as Mega Man and Rush's rivals.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]     Slash Man's Stage[CR]Heavily based off the film Jurassic Park, Slash Man's stage contains robotic dinosaurs--some can shoot razor sharp propellers, and others can help Mega Man get across spiked plains. Mega Man will also go though waterfall sequence with logs coming down the waterfall's stream--the logs are used as platforms for Mega Man to get through. Eventually Mega Man will encounter a large dinosaur as a mid-boss fight.     Shade Man's Stage[CR]This stage has areas of robotic zombies that will regenerate. They come out of a coffin that rise up out of the ground. Robotic crows will appear to give Mega Man a hard time - the stand in the way and shoot out a pellet. Enemies will sneak up on Mega Man from the background. Mega Man will also encounter a mid boss fight in this stage as well--a giant pumpkin that bounces around as one of its attack, then the top and bottom sides will open up and shoot out pellets at Mega Man. This level also houses a secret battle with Proto Man. In order to meet him here, you must have met him twice before.     Junk Man's Stage[CR]A factory that has robotic bugs coming out of hives that's made out of junk. Other section contain gaps that's filled with molten lava that Mega Man has to cross. One touch of the lava and Mega Man is done for. Another area is an elevator section with enemies coming down while the elevator is taking Mega Man to the next part of the level.     Freeze Man's Stage[CR]Freeze Man's stage is a snowy level that has robotic polar bears that can breath out spiked balls and throw them at Mega Man, bob sliders that will throw three bombs once destroyed, and enemies that hang on the ceiling and shoot glaciers that can be use as platforms to get through gaps filled with spikes. Sections of the stage have platforms that are covered with slippery ice - if not careful, Mega Man could accidentally fall off.     Burst Man's Stage[CR]This stage has platforms that are ticking time bombs. A large portion of the stage is done underwater - the water can increase the height that Mega Man can jump, but it can be dangerous for Mega Man because some areas in the stage have spikes hanging on the ceiling. In other sections, the water level will rise up and down, Mega Man will float on top when the water level is up - which will help Mega Man get through sections with gaps that are filled with spikes.     Turbo Man's Stage[CR]Most of this stage is made out of tires. Right at the beginning, Mega Man will be attacked by a robot on a bulldozer with spikes on the front. Other sections have tires that are attached to chains. They can get in the way of Mega Man jumping across spiked gaps. Another has Mega Man going dropping down avoiding fiery beams that will destroy Mega Man with one hit (This section is reminiscent of Quick Man's level from Mega Man 2).     Spring Man's Stage[CR]This stage contains springs attached on walls, floors, and ceilings- they can launch Mega Man up in the air. Two of the enemies are robotic springs; one jumps around the stage and attacks Mega Man, and the other is similar to a Slinky. Sections in the level have jack-in-the-boxes suspended in mid air; they launch out a metal boxing glove. Mega Man can jump on them and change the direction where the metal boxing will aim.    Cloud Man's Stage[CR]Very reminiscence of Air Man's stage from Mega Man 2, Cloud Man's stage takes place up in the air. Some sections have robots that can change the weather depending which weapon is used on it. For example, If Freeze Man's weapon is use, the entire level will be covered in snow.[CR]Robot Masters[CR]Freeze ManFreeze Man[CR]Enemy Alignment: Ice[CR]Enemy Weakness: Junk Shield[CR]Weapon Gained: Freeze CrackerJunk ManJunk Man[CR]Enemy Alignment: Trash[CR]Enemy Weakness: Thunder Bolt[CR] Weapon Gained: Junk ShieldBurst ManBurst Man[CR]Enemy Alignment: Water[CR] Enemy Weakness: Scorch Wheel[CR] Weapon Gained: Danger WrapCloud ManCloud Man[CR]Enemy Alignment: Air[CR] Enemy Weakness: Danger Wrap[CR] Weapon Gained: Thunder BoltSpring ManSpring Man[CR]Enemy Alignment: Coils[CR] Enemy Weakness: Slash Claw[CR] Weapon Gained: Wild CoilSlash ManSlash Man[CR]Enemy Alignment: Claws[CR] Enemy Weakness: Freeze Cracker[CR] Weapon Gained: Slash ClawShade ManShade Man[CR]Enemy Alignment: Sound[CR] Enemy Weakness: Wild Coil[CR] Weapon Gained: Noise CrushTurbo ManTurbo Man[CR]Enemy Alignment: Fire[CR] Enemy Weakness: Noise Crush[CR] Weapon Gained: Scorch Wheel[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Different Shade Man Music[CR]For different music for the Shade Man level highlight his level, press and hold the B button, and then select his level.

Then go to ProtoMan's room in TurboMan's stage (this one is at the very top of the area with the traffic light platforms; go through the wall just before you reach the top of the ladder). He will mention something about the Super Adaptor.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Different Shade Man Music[CR]After you go to these two rooms (doesn't matter with order you go to those), go to ShadeMan's stage. Continue like normal until you reach the Pumpkin mini-boss. Shoot the small orange core of the Pumpkin (NOT the eyes on the outside). After you defeat it, it will open a hole on the bottom. Go down until you reach the room with a lone green Sniper Joe. Defeat the Sniper Joe, and instead of going down the ladder, go right through a secret passage and enter the gate you find. If you did everything correctly, ProtoMan will challenge you to a duel.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Different Shade Man Music[CR]Once you defeat ProtoMan, he will give you the ProtoShield. This can be used at the same time as the MegaBuster (don't forget to select it), and it will block many enemy shots (like those birds that hatch from the egg; let all of them run into the shield and they will die).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Different Shade Man Music[CR]Enter the following password: 1415 5585 7823 6251 [CR]Then press and hold R &amp; L, and push the start button.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mega Man Soccer (known in Japan as Rockman's Soccer, also known as Mega Man's Soccer) is a sidescrolling soccer game developed and published by Capcom for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in April 1994. There was no European release.[CR]A spin-off of the original Mega Man series, players control a variety of robots (including hero Mega Man, ally Proto Man, and 19 of Mega Man's previously-defeated Robot Masters and other adversaries), each with their own special ability, as they face off in games of soccer.[CR]Up to two players can play simultaneously (either competitively or co-operatively) in one of four modes (including the game's main campaign, Capcom Championship Mode, where players start with a team of only Mega Man and must gain new teammates by defeating their teams).[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Mega ManProto ManCut Man (Mega Man)Elec Man (Mega Man)Bomb Man (Mega Man)Ice Man (Mega Man)Fire Man (Mega Man)Bubble Man (Mega Man 2)Flash Man (Mega Man 2)Air Man (Mega Man 2)Wood Man (Mega Man 2)Needle Man (Mega Man 3)Top Man (Mega Man 3)Snake Man (Mega Man 3)Gemini Man (Mega Man 3)Skull Man (Mega Man 4)Toad Man (Mega Man 4)Dust Man (Mega Man 4)Pharaoh Man (Mega Man 4)Enker (Mega Man: Dr. Wily's Revenge)Dr. Wily (only playable via certain League Mode teams)[CR][B]Teams:[/B][CR]Capcom Championship Mode[CR]The playable team in this mode consists of only eight multiples of Mega Man.

				<title_clean>Mega Man X</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mega Man X (known in Japan as Rockman X) is a side-scrolling action platformer developed and published by Capcom for the Super Famicom in December 1993 and on the US Super Nintendo Entertainment System on January 1994.[CR]The spiritual successor to the classic Mega Man platformers (for the Nintendo Entertainment System), Mega Man X reinvents the series by introducing players to a faster, more technologically adept hero (Mega Man X, known simply as "X") set in a brand new (and darker) storyline (which is further expanded by numerous sequels).[CR]Set in the year 21XX, a century after the adventures of the original Mega Man, players control Mega Man X, a highly-advanced android (with the unprecedented ability to think as a human) developed by Dr. Light and incubated in a large capsule for a 100-year diagnostic program (to help X understand sanity and morality). He is found by roboticist Dr. Cain, who uses Dr. Light's design notes to replicate X into a new generation of androids (known as "Reploids"). When certain Reploids mysteriously became a threat towards humanity (becoming known as "Mavericks"), the government creates an elite Reploid police force (known as "Maverick Hunters") led by Dr. Cain's latest design, Sigma. However, Sigma (along with the majority of the Maverick Hunters) defects and becomes a Maverick, and it's up to X (who feels guilty for being the prototype behind the Mavericks) and Zero (the new combat-savvy leader of the Maverick Hunters) to infiltrate and destroy Sigma's forces (including eight Mavericks and the mercenary Maverick Vile).[CR]X has a variety of new abilities (not used by the original Mega Man), including the ability to cling onto walls (slowing his descent while allowing him to walljump), quickly switch to a new weapon (without having to pause the game), use a mechanized combat vehicle (the "Ride Armor"), and find unique upgrades to his armor (boosting his vitality and attack capabilities while giving him the ability to perform a fast dash, rather than the original's slide, and supercharge his X-Buster). Despite these additions, the game uses the same progression, as players guide the hero through each themed level (in any order), led by a boss that grants a new weapon when defeated (and is weak by a specific other weapon), before infiltrating the major antagonist's fortress.[CR]Mega Man X later received a port to the PC (in 1995), Wii (via Wii Virtual Console on April 18, 2011), all iOS devices (on December 21, 2011), and Wii U (via Wii U Virtual Console on May 30, 2013). It was included in the Mega Man X Collection compilation for PlayStation 2 and GameCube on January 10, 2006. It also received a complete remake in 2005 for the PlayStation Portable (as Mega Man: Maverick Hunter X). The remake features new 2.5D graphics, animated full-motion video, voice acting (with a new script), a rearranged soundtrack, and new gameplay mechanics (including game saving, restructured levels, and difficulty settings).[CR][B]Upgrades:[/B][CR]X finds a Light Capsule, which grants him an upgrade.[CR]Throughout the game, X can find rare large blue Light Capsules which show him a holographic message from his creator, Dr. Light. Depending on which Capsule X finds, Dr. Light briefs him on what the upgrade does before allowing him to step into the Capsule to receive it (giving him a shiny new replacement piece for his armor).Helmet Piece - Allows X to break certain blocks by hitting them from underneath. Found in Storm Eagle's stage.Body Piece - Reduces the damage X receives by half. Found in Sting Chameleon's stage.Arm Pieces - Allows X to both charge up his special weapons (for an alternate, more powerful effect) and further charge his standard X-Buster (to fire a super-charged blast that can cut through enemies). Found in either Flame Mammoth's stage or by reaching a certain point late in the story (in which it cannot be skipped over).Leg Pieces - Allows X to both dash on the ground and break certain blocks by jumping on it. Found in a mandatory path in Chill Penguin's stage and cannot be skipped over.Hidden CapsuleX hitting Sigma with a Hadouken, K.O.'ing him in one quick hit. [CR]Along with the four Capsules above, the game includes a very hidden fifth Capsule which grants X a powerful ability.[CR]If he manages to reach a certain point in Armored Armadillo's stage after receiving all four armor parts and obtaining every Sub Tank and Life Up powerups, and then doing a exact process (by collecting a specific hard-to-reach Life Energy pellet while restarting at any point of the level three times in a row), he can reach a Capsule in which Dr. Light (sporting a Karate Gi) grants X the power to perform a Hadouken (made famous by Ryu and Ken of Capcom's Street Fighter series).[CR]By inputting a specific combination (down, then down and forward, then forward, then the Attack button) while X is on the ground and has a full Life Energy gauge, X throws a small (but deadly) fireball that can eliminate most bosses in one or two hits.[CR]In the PC version, the exact process is replaced by reaching the Life Energy pellet with full Life and Weapon Energy.[CR][B]Bosses:[/B][CR]Armored Armadillo  [CR]Based on the armadillo, Armored Armadillo (known as Armor Armarge in the Japanese version) takes control of a mine. Heavily armored, he fights by quickly shooting laser balls and by curling up into a ball and bouncing off the room. His weakness is the Electric Spark.[CR]Eliminating him grants X the Rolling Shield.[CR] Boomer Kuwanger  [CR]Based on the stag beetle ("kuwagata" in Japanese), Boomer Kuwanger (known as Boomerang Kuwanger in the Japanese version) makes himself comfortable in the top of a large tower. Very agile, he attacks by throwing his headpiece like a boomerang (in similar vein to Cut Man from the original Mega Man), by dashing across the room (sometimes so fast that it resembles teleportation), and by grabbing X with his headpiece and flinging him up to the ceiling. His weakness is the Homing Torpedo.[CR]Eliminating him grants X the Boomerang Cutter.[CR] Chill Penguin  [CR]Based on the penguin, Chill Penguin (known as Icy Penguigo in the Japanese version) is located in a base built into a snowy mountain. A small fighter who fights over an icy floor, he attacks by diving across the slippery floor, spitting balls of ice, and creating sculptures of ice with his breath (which he hurls at X by pulling a switch on the ceiling that activates a blizzard). His weakness is the Fire Wave.[CR]Eliminating him grants X the Shotgun Ice.[CR] Flame Mammoth  [CR]Based on the mammoth, Flame Mammoth (known as Burnin' Noumander in the Japanese version) takes control of a factory. A large figure who fights on a conveyor belt, he attacks by spitting flaming balls of oil and by jumping towards X (stunning X if he happens to be on the conveyor when Flame lands). His weakness is Storm Tornado, though successful use of the Boomerang Cutter limits his ability to spit oil.[CR]Eliminating him grants X the Fire Wave.[CR] Launch Octopus  [CR]Based on the octopus, Launch Octopus (known as Launch Octopuld in the Japanese version) controls a subterranean base underneath an ocean. Preferring to fight underwater, he attacks by firing a series of small torpedoes and by twirling around to form a whirlpool (pulling X towards him). His weakness is the Rolling Shield, though successful use of the Boomerang Cutter limits his ability to form a whirlpool.[CR]Eliminating him grants X the Homing Torpedo.[CR] Spark Mandrill  [CR]Based on the mandrill, Spark Mandrill (known as Spark Mandriller in the Japanese version) takes control of a power plant. He is a hulking fighter who attacks with his fists, by swinging on the ceiling onto X, and by pounding on the ground (causing sparks to travel away from him and rise up walls). His weakness is the Shotgun Ice.[CR]Eliminating him grants X the Electric Spark.Sting Chameleon  [CR]Based on the chameleon, Sting Chameleon (known as Sting Chameleao in the Japanese version) hides in a robotic forest. He can blend into his surroundings (making him harder for X to detect) and attacks X by either latching onto the ceiling with his tongue and swinging around (causing spikes to fall) or by grabbing onto the wall and firing three spikes simultaneously (by swinging his tail). His weakness is the Boomerang Cutter.[CR]Eliminating him grants X the Chameleon Sting, which allows him to fire a large energy ball that splits into three laser beams. When the Chameleon Sting is charged, X's armor color changes rapidly, granting him temporary invulnerability (at the cost of only being able to fire the uncharged Chameleon Sting).Storm Eagle  [CR]Based on the eagle, Storm Eagle (known as Storm Eagleed in the Japanese version) commands a large airship that is docked at an airport. He can fly into the air and attacks by either spitting an egg at X (causing it to split into four little birds that head towards him), diving through the air at X, or by flapping his wings so fast that it starts pushing X back (and because they fight on the airship as it's flying, it can cause X to fall off the edge). His weakness is the Chameleon Sting.[CR]Eliminating him grants X the Storm Tornado.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]In 2005, Capcom released a 5-disc box set called Capcom Music Generation Rockman X1~6. It contains the original music of Mega Man X through Mega Man X6 as well as some unused tracks. Mega Man X tracks cover half of the first disc and the tracks are listed as followed:Track #TitleLength1.CAPCOM LOGO0:072.TITLE0:273.PASS WORD1:264.OPENING STAGE1:405. VAVA 10:276.VAVA 21:097.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mega Man X2 (known in Japan as Rockman X2) is a side-scrolling action platformer developed and published by Capcom (published by Laguna for Europe) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on January 1995.[CR]The second game in the Mega Man X series (and the sequel to the original Mega Man X), players reprise the role of highly-advanced android Mega Man X, who gains some of the major upgrades unlocked from the previous game (plus new upgrades, such as the ability to detect secret areas, perform a Dash in mid-air, store two charged beams at once for quick successive strikes, and perform a powerful screen-clearing attack).[CR]Set six months after the events of the original Mega Man X (where X destroys Maverick leader Sigma and his forces, at the cost of the destruction of his mentor, Zero), X becomes the leader of the elite Reploid police force "Maverick Hunters". As the Maverick rebellion kicks back up, X must destroy a new group of Mavericks while hunting down the remains of Zero (taken by the "X-Hunters", a trio of powerful Mavericks consisting of Serges, Agile, and Violen).[CR]Along with upgrades to the game's mechanics and graphics, the game includes an in-cartridge enhancement chip (Cx4) that allowed the game to use limited 3D wireframe graphics (including rotating and scaling effects). This technology would later be used in Mega Man X3.[CR]The game was later released on the Wii (via Wii Virtual Console on June 14, 2012) and Wii U (via Wii U Virtual Console on January 2, 2014).[CR][B]Upgrades:[/B][CR]X, using a Light Capsule to get an upgrade.[CR]Like the previous game, X can find rare large blue Light Capsules, scattered throughout the game, which show him a holographic message from his creator, Dr. Light. Depending on which Capsule X finds, Dr. Light briefs him on what the upgrade does before allowing him to step into the Capsule to receive it (giving him a shiny new replacement piece for his armor).Helmet Piece - Allows X to use his "Item Tracer", in which a cursor (shown on the screen) automatically zooms in to hidden passages. Found in Crystal Snail's stage.Body Piece - Allows X to perform the "Giga Crush" technique, which clears all enemies on the screen (but uses a gauge that only fills up by taking damage and can only be used once per level). X also takes 50% less damage from attacks. Found in Morph Moth's stage.Arm Pieces - Allows X to both charge up his special weapons (for an alternate, more powerful effect) and grants him an X-Buster on his other arm (allowing him to further charge his standard X-Buster, which fires two consecutive super-charged blasts that can cut through enemies). Found in Wheel Gator's stage.Leg Pieces - Allows X to dash in mid-air. Found in Overdrive Ostrich's stage.Hidden Capsule[CR]Along with the four Capsules above, the game includes a very hidden fifth Capsule which grants X a powerful ability (in similar vein to the secret ability in the previous game).[CR]If he manages to reach a certain point in the third stage of the X-Hunter's fortress after receiving all four armor parts and obtaining every Sub Tank and Life Up powerups, and then following a specific path (covered in spikes), he can reach a Capsule in which Dr. Light grants X the power to perform a Shoryuken (made famous by Ryu and Ken of Capcom's Street Fighter series).[CR]By inputting a specific combination (forward, then down, then down and forward, then the Attack button) while X is on the ground and has a full Life Energy gauge, X performs a powerful close-ranged rising uppercut that can deal serious damage to bosses. Earning this ability is not saved in the game's password system.[CR][B]Bosses:[/B][CR]Bubble Crab[CR]Based on the crab, Bubble Crab (known as Bubbly Crablos in the Japanese version) controls a subterranean base located under the deep sea. His weakness is the Spin Wheel.[CR]Eliminating him grants X the Bubble Splash.Crystal Snail[CR]Based on the snail, Crystal Snail (known as Crystar Mymine in the Japanese version) takes controls of a crystal mine. His weakness is the Magnet Mine.[CR]Eliminating him grants X the Crystal Hunter.Flame Stag[CR]Based on the stag-moose, Flame Stag (known as Flame Stagger in the Japanese version) controls a base within a volcano. His weakness is the Bubble Splash.[CR]Eliminating him grants X the Speed Burner.Magna Centipede[CR]Based on the centipede, Magna Centipede (known as Magne Hyakulegger in the Japanese version) takes control of a central computer station. His weakness is the Silk Shot.[CR]Eliminating him grants X the Magnet Mine.Morph Moth[CR]Based on the moth, Morph Moth (known as Metamor Mothmeanos in the Japanese version) hides in a junkyard for robots. His weakness is the Speed Burner.[CR]Eliminating him grants X the Silk Shot.Overdrive Ostrich[CR]Based on the ostrich, Overdrive Ostrich (known as Sonic Ostreague in the Japanese version) controls a series of bases in the desert. His weakness is the Crystal Hunter.[CR]Eliminating him grants X the Sonic Slicer.Wheel Gator[CR]Based on the alligator, Wheel Gator (known as Wheel Alligates in the Japanese version) commands a dinosaur-shaped tank (which, at the time, is wreaking havoc in a city). His weakness is the Strike Chain.[CR]Eliminating him grants X the Spin Wheel.Wire Sponge[CR]Based on a sponge animal, Wire Sponge (known as Wire Hetimarl in the Japanese version) controls the Weather Control Center (an structure allowing him to manipulate the weather inside it at any time). His weakness is the Sonic Slicer.[CR]Eliminating him grants X the Strike Chain.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Cover Art[CR]In 2005, Capcom released a 5-disc box set called Capcom Music Generation Rockman X1~6. It contains the original music of Mega Man X through Mega Man X6 as well as some unused tracks. Mega Man X2 tracks span the second half of disc 1 and the tracks are as followed:Track #TitleLength36.CAPCOM LOGO0:0637.OPENING1:0038.TITLE0:1939.PASS WORD0:2340.OPENING STAGE1:2541.ANOTHER BOSS 10:1742.ANOTHER BOSS 20:3843.DEMO0:3144.STAGE SELECT 10:2545.STAGE START0:0846.WIRE HETIMARL STAGE2:0147.METAMOR MOTHMEANOS STAGE1:5048.FLAME STAGGER STAGE1:3449.MAGNE HYAKULEGGER STAGE1:3650.SONIC OSTREAGUE STAGE1:3451.BUBBLY CRABLOS STAGE1:5252.WHEEL ALLIGATES STAGE1:0753.CRISTAR MYMINE STAGE1:3954.BOSS 10:1755.BOSS 21:0256.STAGE CLEAR0:0757.STAGE SELECT 21:0558.COUNTER HUNTER STAGE 11:0659.COUNTER HUNTER STAGE 21:0360.ZERO0:3861.SIGMA 1st0:3462.SIGMA 2nd0:5063.DR.RIGHT0:2764.ENDING1:5365.STAFF ROLL1:15[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Disappearing Enemies[CR]This will work with almost any enemy that can be frozen with the Crystal Hunter. Freeze the enemy with a normal shot then pause the game. Now at the pause menu select the X. Buster and hit start. The enemy that was frozen will no longer be there.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Disappearing Enemies[CR]To do this trick, you must have all of Zero's parts and the Flaming Dragon Punch. First, go to the last Sigma stage. Right before you enter the room where Sigma drops in, stop. Dragon Punch your way in and try to land where Zero will punch his hole after the dialogue. If done correctly, X will fall through the hole when Zero punches it out. When Zero starts talking, do not let his dialogue disappear. Leave it there until X lands in Sigma's room. When Sigma enters, make Zero's dialogue go away and X should be able to walk over to Sigma. Have X stand right by Sigma, and when Sigma begins to fill up his energy meter, Dragon Punch him.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Disappearing Enemies[CR]When the fight begins, Sigma should not be able to harm you no matter what he does, making it easy for you to conserve you SubTanks and energy for the second battle. Also, this glitch makes your charged shots look a vibrant reddish-pink color.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Disappearing Enemies[CR]It will stay this way until the second Sigma battle begins. Also, using the Giga Crush causes your X-Buster shots to go back to their original color.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Kens Shoryuken![CR]Megaman can use Ken's Shoryuken if you get all of the energy tanks, all of the hearts, and all of X's parts. The capsule for the shoryuken is in the third x-hunter stage (Agile). At one point in his stage, there is a ladder with many bats around.  Use the Crystal Hunter to crystalize a bat to reach the ladder. Follow the path until you reach a downward path. Scroll on the left side of the path until X discovers a passage. You must be at full power for the capsule to appear.  Dr. Light will give you Ken's Shoryuken.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Diagnostics Test[CR]To see the Mega Man X2 diagnostic test, hold the B button on controller 2, then turn on your system. Keep holding until the test appears on screen. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Diagnostics Test[CR]There are two hidden features in the ending, which are triggered from different variables. The first and most obvious difference is whether or not all of Zero's parts were collected from the X-Hunters; if the player didn't collect them, Zero will be fought and a black copy of Zero will appear in the ''Thanks for playing!!'' screen, but if they were found then Zero will not be a boss and the real one will take the fake's place. Another difference is whether or not the player collected any upgrades from capsules - if Mega Man X has no additional armor, Zero will appear for a moment when the cast roll transitions to the boss list, otherwise he will be missing (hearts and tanks are not factored).</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mega Man X3 (known in Japan as Rockman X3) is a side-scrolling action platformer developed and published by Capcom for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on January 1996.[CR]The third game in the Mega Man X series (and the sequel to the Mega Man X2), players control android Mega Man X and, for the first time, his Reploid ally Zero (who can be called in to deal with tough situations thanks to his energy sword). It is the last game in the franchise to feature the original art and gameplay style of Mega Man X (as well as the password system).[CR]Set sometime after the events of Mega Man X2 (where X and the rebuilt Zero defeat the Maverick Sigma for the second time), the Maverick rebellion becomes neutralized due to the technology of Reploid scientist Dr. Doppler. Reformed Mavericks form an utopia near the scientist (named Dopple Town) and lived peacefully before they suddenly go berserk and cause mayhem. Believing Doppler to be responsible, X and Zero must defeat the eight Maverick leaders of Dopple Town and foil the mad scientist's plans (while surviving his henchmen, Bit and Byte, and a mysterious Maverick).[CR]An enhanced version of the game was released for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation in Japan (on April 26, 1996) and Europe (published by Virgin Interactive on March 1997). While the core game remains the same, it includes animated full-motion video cutscenes, a rearranged soundtrack, and new sound effects. This version was later released for the PC in Japan (on March 28, 1997) and North America (on October 5, 1998) and is included in the Mega Man X Collection compilation for the PlayStation 2 and GameCube (released on January 10, 2006).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay has only somewhat differed from Mega Man X2 by making the wall jumping slightly easier to preform while reploids become tougher. The gameplay compared to the Mega Man series is much more fast paced with more tricky and more powerful mavericks than ever giving rise to more difficult battles. As a side point, their battles can be completed faster than other bosses in previous games, as they are more susceptible to their weakness, and take more damage from their attacks.[CR]Boss Robots(Mavericks)[CR]At the end of every level X must fight a boss to proceed, and after fighting all 8 bosses he goes to the final fight against Doppler and his army. Here is a list of the boss robots in order to exploit all of their weaknesses.Boss selection[CR]Boss- Blizzard Buffalo[CR]Weapon: Frost shield[CR]Power-9200rp[CR]Speed-3200rp[CR]Weakness-Parasitic Bomb[CR]Boss- Toxic Seahorse[CR]Weapon: Acid Burst[CR]Power-5800rp[CR]Speed-4300rp[CR]Weakness-Frost Shield[CR]Boss- Tunnel Rhino[CR]Weapon: Tornado Fang[CR]Power-4200rp[CR]Speed-8000rp[CR]Weakness-Acid Burst[CR]Boss- Volt CatfishWeapon: Triad Thunder[CR]Power-8200rp[CR]Speed-1600rp[CR]Weakness-Tornado Fang[CR]Boss- Crush CrawfishWeapon: Spinning Blade[CR]Power-4000rp[CR]Speed-7600rp[CR]Weakness-Triad Thunder[CR]Boss- Neon Tiger[CR]Weapon: Ray Splasher[CR]Power-3600rp[CR]Speed-9900rp[CR]Weakness-Spinning Blade[CR]Boss- Gravity BeetleWeapon: Gravity Well[CR]Power-6200rp[CR]Speed-3600rp[CR]Weakness-Ray Splasher[CR]Boss- Blast Hornet[CR]Weapon: Parasitic Bomb[CR]Power-3400rp[CR]Speed-8600rp[CR]Weakness-Gravity Well[CR][B]Upgrades:[/B][CR]Armor Capsules[CR]Dr. Light has once again hidden some secret capsules that will enhance Mega Man X's abilities. When Mega Man X steps into one of these capsules, it will come to life and change the appearance of Mega Man X. Here are descriptions of some of the Capsules:[CR]Boots(Nothing required)[CR]Gives X the ability to dash again while in the air[CR]Location-Blizzard Buffalo's lair[CR]Gun[CR](Boots and T.Fang)[CR]Allows X to charge up one level and fire two powerful shots; also X can charge special weapons.[CR]Location-Neon Tiger's lair[CR]Helmet[CR](Gun and Triad T.)[CR]A map will appear at the beginning of the level to show X where hidden items are located.[CR]Location-Drill Rhino's lair[CR]Armor[CR](Boots, G. Well and Gun)[CR]Automatically creates a defense shield on Mega Man X's chassis that reduces damage by 50%. After getting hurt a shield will automatically form around X to lessen damage by 1/2[CR]Location-Volt Catfish's lairRobot Ride Armor[CR]In addition to the armor capsules, Dr. Light has set out 4 different armors known as robot ride armor. Mega Man X and Zero must find these 4 armors, each with different capabilities and functions. The armor looks like a giant robot that they can activate by jumping into it. Once X finds an armor, he may use the armor in any stage where he may find the Robot Ride platforms.[CR]If X has found an armor, the platform will activate. A menu will appear just to the left of the platform, so use the game pad or the arrow keys to select which armor X would like to use. While in the robot ride armor, Mega Man X and Zero will not be damaged. The armor can be damaged, but can be healed by returning to the platform. If the armor is destroyed, X cannot use it again until he enters a new stage. He can also jump out if need be by jumping while holding up on the D-pad.[CR]Robot Ride Armors[CR]Chimera[CR]Hawk[CR]Frog[CR]Kangaroo[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Cover Art[CR]In 2005 Capcom released a 5-disc box set called Capcom Music Generation Rockman X1~6.

Go inside, and defeat the bug robot. He's not too difficult...stay toward the center, then when he comes towards you, dash under him, and he should land on the ground behind you, then shoot him. After you defeat the bug robot, it will land on Zero, damaging him badly. At this point, he will give Mega Man his Z-Sabre to use for the rest of the game. Use the Z-Sabre by charging the Y button all the way up to the fifth energy level(green) and then firing.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Cx4 test[CR]Note: For this to work, you need all power-ups BESIDES the chips, and have full health. Go to the First stage of Dr.Doppler's Lab. Near the end, you should see a bunch of spiked balls falling into a pit. Jump and cling onto the left side of the pit and you should slide into a secret room, which contains the upgrade capsule for the golden chip. This chip gives you all the benefits from all the chips, and turns Mega Man's suit into a golden color.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Metal Combat: Falcon's Revenge is the sequel to the SNES game  Battle Clash. It features all new Standing Tanks (STs) are antagonists and is based around a tournament to the death known as The Battle Game. Anubis is once again the villain, returning in his near-indomitable ST Thanatos.[CR]Like its predecessor, the game features one-on-one fights with other STs and their occupants. The player's ST (the Falcon) is driven by Mike Anderson, an NPC character, and so it'll automatically follow the opponent ST as it moves around. This allows the player character to only have to concern themselves with the ST's weapons.[CR]The game is one of a handful of titles to support the Super Scope peripheral for the SNES.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Each fight requires that the player wear down the enemy ST's health bar. There's usually several ways to do this, but the goal is often to find the quickest and most damaging means to take down the opponent before they can do to the same to the player's ST. This involves exploiting weak points, building up the energy bar for powerful targeted shots, using the limited supply of bombs and intercepting the enemy's shots to mitigate damage intake. [CR]Due to the game's combat heavy nature, accuracy is important. To help compensate for potential issues sensor alignment or bad TV placement, the game follows its title screen with a gun calibration to ensure the player can correctly aim from their position.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] Modes[CR] Single Player[CR]Battle Game [CR]The Battle Game is effectively Metal Combat's campaign mode, which pits players in their ST Falcon (or Tornado if a cheat code is entered) against the top ST combatants of various regions of Earth. After all of Earth's top combatants are defeated, the player will move on to space to fight the Battle Game ruler Thanatos. What they will instead find, are plot twists abound.[CR]Players engage in combat with enemies in a one on one setting, using the Super Scope to fire on their opponents. The player's ST is capable of firing very weak rapid shots (typically used defensively to shoot down enemy projectiles), and charged shots of varying power depending on how long the shot is charged for. The most powerful charged shot available to the player is the Treble Shot, which can be used to cause massive damage to enemy weak points, as well as wipe most enemy projectiles off the screen in a single shot.[CR]Aside from the basic rapid and charged shots, the player can also acquire special one-use power ups. At the end of each battle, the player will be rewarded with a bomb (which carries over to the next fight), and at the end of most battles the player will be upgraded with a special single shot power (such as a temporary shield, or a power boost). Players may hold a maximum of five bombs, and as many special items as they'd like, although they can only bring two special items into battle (bombs must be brought into battle and are automatically added to the players weapon list).[CR]Each opponent ST that the player faces will have a weak point of some kind. These weak points can be found in one of two ways, depending on the enemy: The enemy ST will either perform an action that will cause the weak spot to glow and be given away, or, the player can fire a treble shot at the enemy and expose their weak point. Typically hitting a weak point with a treble shot will destroy that area on the enemy ST. However, because some weak points can only be exposed with a treble shot, the only possible follow up is to hit the spot with a weaker charged shot.[CR]Other individual parts of an enemy ST, such as the arms or legs, can be destroyed, allowing the player to cripple an enemy part by part. Rather then be adversely effected by losing parts, some enemies will simply fire powerful shots from their missing parts, making this a sometimes risky tactic.[CR]A cheat code may be entered at the title screen to unlock access to a second ST, named Tornado. Tornado's weapon systems charge shots much more rapidly at the cost of needing to charge ten times before firing a treble shot (or in this case, more of a decible shot). The ST Tornado also has a much lower defense in exchange for this offensive power. In addition to combat changes, some areas of the plot are changed to accommodate the new ST and pilot.[CR]Time Trials[CR]In Time Trials, the player selects their difficulty level (Low, Medium, or High), which determines the three opponents they will face during the time trial. The player then fights the three opponents for the difficulty level they have selected, and at the end receive a cumulative fight time. In each fight, the player is given a single bomb, and no special power ups. If the player's ST is destroyed during a fight, their time of defeat is kept should they decide to continue, and is added to their total fight time when the level is subsequently finished.[CR]Training Mode[CR]Training Mode allows the player to replay each ST's respective tutorial missions from the start of the game.[CR] Multiplayer[CR]Combat Game[CR]Combat Game allows for two player combat; one player uses the SNES Control Pad to control an enemy ST of their choosing, while another player uses the super scope to fight them like a normal enemy.[CR]Using the XYAB buttons, the control pad player can use one of four attacks in their ST's arsenal, and using the D-Pad they can control the movement of the battle. Like single player CPU battles, the control pad ST can be crippled and has weak points. The last player with health remaining wins.[CR]Time Trials[CR]Multiplayer Time Trials play exactly the same as single player time trials, with the exception being that both players are given a chance at defeating each enemy. At the end of three rounds, a cumulative time is totaled for each player, and the player with the lower time wins.[CR]Battle Game Opponents[CR]On their way to save humanity, the players will encounter a colorful cast of STs and pilots. Here they are in order of appearance:[CR]ST: Garam Mk2[CR]Pilot: Guido[CR]Area: Neo New York, America[CR]Weakness: Stomach[CR]Notes: Appeared in Battle Clash and remains largely unchanged.[CR]ST: Siamang[CR]Pilot: Chada[CR]Area: Borneo, Oceania[CR]Weakness: Tail[CR]Notes: Is Guido's brother.[CR]ST: Wong[CR]Pilot: Dayan[CR]Area: Mongolia, Asia[CR]Weakness: Exposed head[CR]Notes: Only fights the player because he thinks they are invading Mongolia.[CR]ST: Griffin[CR]Pilot: Orusoh[CR]Area: Earth's Atmosphere, Orbital Station Babel[CR]Weakness: Antennae, Lower body[CR]Notes: Challenges the player to a suicide duel above the Earth.[CR]ST: Viscount[CR]Pilot: Carlos[CR]Area: Moonbase LUNA[CR]Weakness: Chest, Legs[CR]Notes: Uses a shield, and a gun shaped like a Super Scope.[CR]ST: Thanatos[CR]Pilot: Anubis[CR]Area: The Surface of Mars[CR]Weakness: Chest, Limbs[CR]Notes: Attempts to suck in the player to their death upon his defeat.[CR]ST: Arachnus[CR]Pilot: Danpe[CR]Area: Orbiting Jupiter[CR]Weakness: Head[CR]Notes: Will enter a frenzied state if its tail is destroyed.[CR]ST: Cobra[CR]Pilot: Zephyr[CR]Area: Epsilon-Ring[CR]Weakness: Lower body[CR]Notes: Absorbs most of the player's attacks.[CR]ST: Groken[CR]Pilot: Pamera[CR]Area: The Methane Sea[CR]Weakness: Many scattered throughout the ST[CR]Notes: Zephyr's wife.[CR]ST: Vivirus [CR]Pilot: True Anubis[CR]Area: Inside the Space Fortress[CR]Weakness:[CR]Form 1: Chest, Limbs[CR]Form 2: Center of the ST[CR]Notes: After being defeated once, Vivirus will morph into a new form.[CR]ST: Giga-Desp[CR]Pilot: Typhon[CR]Area: Space Fortress Core[CR]Weakness: The area covered by Rola[CR]Notes: Takes the player's ally, Rola, hostage.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]2nd Player (not using superscope) can play ST's in alternate colors.  There are two color schemes: alternate color and REAL MODE gold.  Both colors are aesthetic and does not change gameplay.Note:2nd player can also do this while previewing which ST to play.  Press the select button until you highlight the ST.  The screen will go blank for less then half a second.  Apply the button combination while it's blank, and when the ST preview appears, it will be in its alternate color.</plot>

				<title_clean>Metal Marines</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Metal Marines, known in Japan as Militia, is a sci-fi strategy game that features both real-time and turn-based elements. The player is one of the last surviving commanders of the United Earth Empire, an army attempting to thwart the antagonistic Zorgeuf's forces from conquering Earth and its space colonies.[CR]The game uses the isometric perspective popularized by god-sim/strategy games like Populous, Powermonger and Utopia, and gives players a certain amount of time and resources to build new facilities and deploy new units before control is switched over to the enemy's forces. The goal of either side is to take out the well-defended bases of the other. The player's offensive options include missiles and large bipedal mechs: the eponymous Metal Marines.[CR]Metal Marines was released on the Super Nintendo and PC by Namco. Mindscape handled publishing duties for the PC and PAL SNES versions. It was later added to the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007 in both Japan and US territories.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Metal Marines takes place in the year 2117, two years after the nigh apocalyptic destruction of Earth during the Antimatter War. The nations of the world had invested heavily in Antimatter Weapons, stockpiling them across the planet. When these weapons were finally used, an unforeseen and catastrophic event occurred, a chain reaction exploding every AM device across the globe. The power of these weapons was so huge that the continents were reduced to islands, only small sections of the planet's surface surviving.[CR]This is the backstory for the current conflict, however the PC and SNES versions differ quite dramatically in regards to the plot for the player's adventure.SNES[CR]The player is part of the "Space Colonies Allied Forces", a military force assembled by the habitats orbiting the Earth. The player and the colonies are on a mission to free the Earth from the despotic rule of Zorgeuf, the self appointed dictator of what remains of the planet's surface.PC[CR]In this version the player is part of United Earth Empire, a coalition of the remaining nations of Earth. Zorgeuf is still a dictator, though he is in charge of space-based colonies and now seeks to establish his rule over Earth as well.[CR]Ultimately, the player is charged with thwarting Zorgeuf's plans for domination, defeating him and his subordinates in military engagements on what remains of surface of the planet.[CR]</plot>

As their ambassador, they choose to send the Metal Morph, a being made from living metal, as he is the only being that can survive the inter-dimensional travel.  The people of Earth have created a Hypergate, which links the two galaxies together.  Upon arriving at the alien destination, the Metal Morph is quickly ambushed and is taken to an alien lab for study so that they can travel through the Hypergate themselves.  The Metal Morph quickly escapes and begins to get back to his sabotaged ship...[CR]Metal Morph is a side-scrolling platformer.  As the Metal Morph, you can jump, duck and shoot, as well as transform into an invulnerable liquid blob of metal.  While as a blob, you can also travel through pipes to get to areas you couldn't normally.  Power ups such as triple shots and homing missiles make battle easier for you.[CR]The game also has sections where you fly your spaceship to track down your stolen pods.  In flight mode, you can move the ship up, down, left and right while shooting enemies and dodging their incoming shots.  Power ups such as speed up (which makes the ship travel faster to its destination) and shields (which prevent instant death) can also be found.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Misc.

				<title_clean>Metal Warriors</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]As one of Earth's last remaining citizens, the player join a group of warriors who fight for Earth's safety, the Metal Warriors. Players pilot a giant mech around side-scrolling levels, saving other stranded citizens, and fighting off enemy mechs belonging to the Dark Axis. The player can pick up power ups as well as exit his vehicle and pilot new mechs, which are scattered across the game's vast levels. The game's story unfolds in detailed, anime-like cutscenes that introduced every level.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Metal Warriors presents a side-scrolling experience that is surprisingly tactical (especially in multiplayer), since the player can eject from his mech and enter new fighting machines that aren't occupied. Every mech has its own set of weapons and handles in a completely different way. It also has large stages than most of its contemporaries, and could be punishing at times as losing at the end of a stage meant the whole thing needed to be played all over. The stages take place in a variety of locales, from jungle and arctic climes, to defending the allied battlecruiser in space.[CR]Players can take command of any mech that isn't occupied by an enemy. Unoccupied mechs show up as gray, standing in a forward-facing, inert pose. Outside of a mech, the player is just a little man with a jetpack that offers him unlimited flight, armed with a pea-shooter and incredibly fragile. Typically, outside the mech the player can take ten hits, though hits from mech-sized weapons do far more damage. Players can't harm mechs with their rifle, though the segments of the game that require the player to eject - say, to flip a switch - often don't pit him against a mech, just enemy soldiers.[CR]Each mech has its own set of weapons and moves, though they all have long-and-short ranged attacks. In general, close combat attacks does more damage, though the ranged options are just as destructive and satisfying.[CR]The power ups scattered throughout each level can greatly change the way a mech handles and make it far more deadly if used in creative ways. For example, a shoulder-mounted rocket launcher can give the more agile mechs some extra punch, while an anti-gravity powerup allows slower vehicles to reach areas they'd have trouble getting to.[CR]Vehicles[CR]Nitro[CR]The first mech the player pilots; that the player begins every mission in the Nitro. The Nitro is the easiest mech to handle with an accurate, rapid-fire plasma rifle that shoots in straight lines and does decent damage, as well as a jetpack that allows for lengthy bursts of flight. For close quarters combat, the Nitro is equipped with a lightsaber-esque beam sword, and, for defense, an energy shield that the Nitro can drop behind it, even in flight. It will stop bullets and damage anything that runs into it.Havoc[CR]The Havoc is burlier and faster than the Nitro, but lacks the ability to fly. Instead, it zips along on skates and can jump extra far, if the pilot allows some room to gather some speed. This makes it a great mech for quick hit-and-run maneuvers, especially if there is a health kit is nearby. Further reinforcing the Havoc's aggressive feel is its weaponry: a scatter-shot, rapid-fire machinegun and an axe-blade-on-a-chain that does great damage and has decent range. For defense, the Havoc has a simple metal shield. While not as tricky as the Nitro, the Havoc can take more hits.Prometheus[CR]The least maneuverable, the Prometheus takes a little more skill to pilot as it's slow and cannot jump. It does, however, have a massive artillery cannon on its shoulders, which fires highly damaging shells that burst into shrapnel. The player can control when the shell bursts, holding down the button until he wants it to explode. For close combat, the Prometheus has a devastating flamethrower that'll continue to burn an opponent for a second or two even after they get out of the fire. Defense is handled by a 360-degree shield that'll soak in plenty of incoming damage.[CR]Since the Prometheus can't jump, it relies on two key features for aerial defense as well as maneuverability. It can deploy floating mines above it that'll do some damage to flying opponents, and a bridgelayer to help it clear chasms (as well as box opponents in). The bridge-blocks can be destroyed.Spider[CR]The spider can climb walls and fire a sticky web which will hold enemy mechs in place. Being webbed by the Spider can get really dangerous. It's agile turret-head that fires a scattering of plasma balls isn't so much of a threat, but it can also use its head to strike out and quickly finish off a trapped mech. The spider doesn't have much for defense in the way of a damage soak, but it can cloak and avoid combat. In multiplayer, the cloak only goes so far because of the split-screen nature of it, though it can still be used to surprise human pilots.[CR]When paired with the anti-gravity power up, it can really confuse opponents by attacking both from the ground as well as the roof.The Ball (Ballistic)[CR]The Ball is all about charging up. For fast movement, players hold a button down until the Ball starts to glow, and then then can shoot off in any direction, damaging anything they hit. In combat, the Ball has a powerful cannon that will fire in different ways depending on how it's charged: a low charge yields several plasma balls that fire straight out, a long charge unleashes a powerful blast. At full strength, it's charge cannon can kill a Prometheus in two hits. It can't move while charging either of these modes. The Ball also has a secondary weapon in a machinegun that works like the Havoc's, and can huddle itself up, using part of its ball-shell as a shield.Drache (Experimental Aerial Assault Ship)[CR]The Drache sets itself apart as it's a flier. It's weak both offensively and defensively, making it the most difficult to master. Though it can in turn prove to be the most effective ship of them all for highly skilled players. For attacks, the Drache has a radial-style, rapid-fire plasma gun that can shoot in all directions depending on which buttons on the controller the player holds down (reminiscent of games such as Robotron and Smash City), and its "close combat" attack makes the Drache fold up its wings and drop down like a falling spike, doing tons of damage to anything beneath. This dive-bomb attack also protects the Drache to a degree, though no pilot should ever rely on this mech being able to take hits. The Drache's aerial maneuverability allows it to dance around anything fired at it, though it can be almost useless in corridor fighting.[CR]Powerups[CR]Weapon UpgradeNumbered Upgrades[CR]These power ups upgrade the gun itself from 1-4 where 4 is a powerful upgrade and can shoot through breakable objects instantly.Bounce Shot[CR]The shots can bounce on the walls and the floor.Seeker Shot[CR]The shots can seek enemies.Attachments[CR]These attachments are equipped on the shoulder of the robot. If the powerup is activated and the player escapes and enters back into the robot, the powerup disappears.Missiles[CR]Fires missiles from the shoulder of the robot.Gravity Switcher[CR]Switches gravity so that players can walk on the ceiling and can also switch back to normal.Speed Boost[CR]Upon activation, an aura is activated. The speed of shooting and melee attacks are increased.Grenades[CR]Can drop grenades and explode upon contact or after 2-3 bounces.Bombs[CR]Used in multiplayer, a bomb drops in front and will explode after 5 seconds for a great amount of damage.[CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]Metal Warriors allows two players to go head-to-head in a split-screen deathmatch mode. It features huge levels for the combatants to battle across that offer unique challenges for each mech, as well as all of the powerups and various vacant mechs for the players to take advantage of. The round ends when a pilot is killed; a desperate pilot could eject from a mech and try to escape to a new one, though he is extremely vulnerable in transit.[CR]Multiplayer matches tend to progress in any number of ways, from close quarters, mech-on-mech slugging matches to tactical ranged engagements. Pairing more deliberate mechs, such as the Prometheus, against odder mechs, such as the Drache, often resulted in both pilots having to think about their approach and use their mechs to the best of their abilities.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Enable Basketball Mode (????? on title screen)[CR]When the Konami logo screen changes to a white background, Player 1 and Player 2 must hold the following buttons until the LucasArts logo is displayed:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Enable Basketball Mode (????? on title screen)[CR]On controller 1: hold d-pad Left, L shoulder button, A button[CR]On controller 2: hold d-pad Up, Y button, Select button, R shoulder button[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Enable Basketball Mode (????? on title screen)[CR]The ????? option will now appear on the title screen.</plot>

				<plot>Indy Car Challenge lets the player get behind the car of some of the fastest race cars on Earth. The player gets to race on 16 different Indy tracks across the U.S., with some tracks also in Canada and Australia. The view of the game is set behind the back of the car and there are three different camera angles during the replay of races along with a "manual" camera that lets the player rotate around the car at 360 degrees.[CR]There is also an option for two friends to compete head-to-head using split screen. The game also features the likeness of Indy Car legend, Michael Andretti, who gives the player advice before each race.[CR]http://www.mobygames.com/game/snes/michael-andrettis-indy-car-challenge[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Various Passwords...[CR]Enter the following at the PASSWORD screen.</plot>

				<title_clean>Michael Jordan - Chaos in the Windy City</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Michael Jordan, the game's protagonist.[CR]Michael Jordan: Chaos in the Windy City is a 2D action platformer developed and published in North America by  Electronic Arts for the  Super Nintendo Entertainment System in November 1994. It was later published in Europe by  Ocean in 1995. Players control  Michael Jordan as he embarks on a quest to rescue fellow basketball players from Dr. Maximus Cranium using a wide variety of  basketballs as weapons. The game also includes  product placements for the  Wheaties and  Gatorade brands, both of which have items the player can pick up to restore health.[CR]The game is split up into four main areas (Holding Cells, Laboratory, Factory, and an amusement park named Riverview), each with their own set of levels and boss fights. The areas also have extra levels in-between them, ranging from a tunnel to a moving  train (an  auto-scrolling level where players must fight off the paparazzi). The game implements an eleven-digit alphanumeric (minus vowels)  password system for keeping track of the player's progress.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Michael Jordan: Chaos in the Windy City plays like a traditional platformer, only slower and more difficult. The D-pad is used to either move left/right, crouch down, climbing up/down ladders, or move up/down certain moving platforms that Michael stands on. The B button is a traditional jump, while the X button is a special "slam jump", which changes the trajectory of basketballs fired (either for clearing out enemies that are too short to be attacked while crouching or for dunking special basketball nets scattered around the level.). Pressing the B button while holding up on the D-pad allows Michael to grab onto pulley objects. Holding down the L button allows Michael to run faster and perform a high, long flip when using the standard jump.[CR]The A button is used to open doors and activate certain switches. Most doors and objects are locked, and require key items (iron, gold, green, red, or yellow) found along the level. Michael can only use one type of key items at a time, which must be switched in the inventory by using the Select button.[CR]Michael can only attack enemies by throwing basketballs at them (by pressing the Y button). Interestingly, he has an infinite repertoire of normal basketballs (which magically appear in his hand the second he throws one). Pressing the Y button will always cause Michael to throw his basketball in a straight line in the direction he's facing. However, pressing the Y button while activating his special "slam jump" causes him to throw his basketball in a downwards trajectory. Basketballs are used for destroying enemies, breaking through walls, and activating switches.[CR]Doors can hold items, basketball coins, or enemies. Some doors hold captives (kidnapped basketball players), which are automatically rescued after giving the player some advice. Some doors can also hold special vortices, which warp the player into special timed bonus rooms when entered.Basketballs [CR]Along with normal basketballs, Michael can throw special types of basketballs (called "power balls") by collecting special power-ups. However, Michael can only carry a certain amount of power balls (with the exception of the Smoking Earthquake Ball), which is instantly filled when collecting that power ball's power-up. Pressing the R button switches between the different types of basketballs. Each power ball has a unique ability when thrown and when "spiked" (by performing a slam jump).Knuckle Ball - White ball (similar in appearance to a  baseball) that goes through solid walls and enemies, returning to Michael like a  boomerang shortly after (picking up any items it touches). Maximum of eight shots.Ice Ball - Blue ball that freezes most enemies into a solid chunk of ice (which shatters after Michael throws another ball at it), which can be used as platforms. Frozen enemies thaw out over time. Spiking an Ice Ball coats part of the floor with a layer of ice, making it slippery to enemies. Maximum of six shots.Rebound Ball - Purple ball that bounces around. Spiking a Rebound Ball splits the ball into two bouncing balls. Maximum of six shots.Flame Ball - Bright orange ball that deals double damage to enemies. Spiking a Flame Ball creates a trail of flame on the floor. Maximum of five shots.Heat-Seeker Ball - Golden ball that tracks down enemies who are within range. Spiking a Heat-Seeker Ball splits the ball into three heat-seeking balls. Maximum of five shots.Iron Ball - Black ball that functions like a  bowling ball, immediately rolling across the floor to hit enemies. Spiking an Iron Ball causes the ball to explode, dealing a point of damage to all enemies on the screen. Maximum of three shots.Smoking Earthquake Ball - Red ball that deals massive damage to all enemies on the screen when spiked. There is no maximum amount of shots, and collecting that power-up gives Michael one Smoking Earthquake Ball.[CR]Lives and Energy[CR]At the beginning of the game, Michael starts with a certain number of  lives (3-5, depending on the difficulty) and three energy globes (that function as  health). Each energy globe represents two units of health (shrinking after one hit of damage and turning blue when empty). Along the way, the player can find items that not only give Michael back his energy, but can increase the number of energy globes.Gatorade Bottle - Common item that restores one-half of an energy globe (one unit of health).Wheaties Box - Uncommon item that restores one energy globe (two units of health).MJ Heart - Rare item that restores three energy globes (six units of health).Golden Heart - Very rare item that increases the maximum number of energy globes by one.High-Tops - Rare sneakers that give the player  temporary invincibility.[CR]If the player depletes all of the energy globes, Michael loses a life and must restart from the previous checkpoint. Along the way, the player will encounter basketball  coins, which has similar function to coins in the  Mario franchise. A silver coin is worth 1 coin while a gold coin is worth 5 coins. Every 100 coins collected gives the player an  extra life. Players can also earn extra lives by collecting rare Golden 23 icons.[CR]Backboards[CR]Along the way, players encounter special basketball backboards, which have special powers that activate when players slam dunk on them.Award Backboard - Trapezoid backboard that drops items or coins.Little Bang Backboard - Triangular backboard that cause little damage to all enemies on the screen.Big Bang Backboard - Backboard (with a comic-like "boom" shape) that cause massive damage to all enemies on the screen.Freeze Backboards - Semi-circular backboard (with the number 23 on it) that temporarily freezes all enemies in place.Milestone Backboards - Square backboard (for which the glass shatters when slammed) that acts like a  checkpoint.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Mickey Mania - The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse</title_clean>
				<plot>Like many other games of its genre, the player takes the role of Mickey and progresses through each level, defeating enemies in the way and solving the occasional puzzle. Most enemies can be defeated by jumping on them or throwing marbles at them. Frequently, the player must jump from platform to platform to advance, sometimes with a time limit (such as escaping a collapsing tower).[CR]Game History:[CR]Originally, Mickey Mania was planned as a game to be released as part of Mickey's 65th birthday. However, as that would have only allowed 6 months to develop the game, this idea was soon scrapped in favor of the more compelling concept of Mickey travelling back to his original cartoons. It pays tribute to Mickey's career (and was released in 1994, the year after Mickey's 65th birthday).[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Level select[CR]Go to the Sound Test menu, set music to Beanstalk 1 and SFX to Extra Try, highlight Exit and hold L until you hear the jingle.[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mickey_Mania:_The_Timeless_Adventures_of_Mickey_Mouse[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Mickey's Playtown Adventure - A Day of Discovery!</title_clean>
				<plot>This game was completed, and I had the chance to chat with Eric Browning about the it:[CR]Mickey never saw the light of day. It was complete, I can't remember what happened. I tried animating Mickey- but Disney does not mess around with that guy and I simply am not trained as an animator. We sent it to Little Gangsters in L.A, an animation house Disney worked with. They did amazing animation- I was humbled by that.[CR]I got a ROM of Mickey, wow, I've come a long way. Pretty neat to see it, I remember every little pixel. The animation isn't as good as I remember, partly due to my inexperience and in large part because I think the programmer was forced to remove frames.

				<plot>One night, as Mickey (or Minnie) lay in bed reading a book of fairy tales, he started to wonder how it would be to live in a far off land, in a magic castle. As he fell asleep, he woke up in the Kingdom of Beanwick, which is constantly tormented by earthquakes. Then, he offers his help to solve the mystery behind those earthquakes.[CR]Mickey's Ultimate Challenge is a puzzle game in which the player chooses either Mickey or Minnie to play with. They'll find five characters from the Disney's universe in the kingdom, and will be prompted to help them in several tasks.[CR]Each task is a different puzzle, given by a specific character. Daisy, for instance, will ask help to clean the castle's paintings hanging on a wall. The task is in fact a memory game, where Mickey or Minnie must clean the pictures matching pairs. After completing one task, they'll receive a gift.[CR]After completing all tasks, Mickey or Minnie must trade the gifts they won with the right characters. For instance, after finishing Goofy's task, they will receive his hammer. The player must then guess who among the other characters would like to receive that hammer.[CR]Giving the right items to the right characters will allow Mickey or Minnie access to the last puzzle and character.</plot>

				<title_clean>Micro Machines</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Micro Machines is a circuit-type racing game with top-down graphics. Players select a character from a vast roster and race against CPU or human opponents; neither the races nor the cars the player finds himself in are related to the character. Each character has a CPU strength rating but there are zero differences between them when played by human players.[CR]Micro Machines is based on the toy line of the same name of very small collectible car models. To suit their miniature form, each course in the game is set in a region of a regular home: the kitchen table, a games room with a pool table, a garden, etc.[CR]Micro Machines was released on almost every console and home computer system available in 1994. It also saw a sequel: Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]One Player Mode[CR] Head-to-Head[CR]In this mode there are only two vehicles are in play: one player controlled and one AI. The objective is to gain enough distance between the opponent as to make him stay out of the screen, when this happens the car on screen is awarded a point from the opponent's pool (each player starts with 4 each). These points go back and forth until someone has all eight points or the race ends naturally after three laps.Challenge[CR]This mode places the player in 25 races against three other AI controlled vehicles. The player starts with a set number of lives, and loses them for each race where they don't place in the top two places. Once they run out of lives, they are eliminated. The AI characters are also eliminated and replaced by stronger opponents as they place badly through the races.[CR] Two Player ModeHead-to-Head[CR]This mode is the same as described in the "One Player" section, only both vehicles are human-controlled.[CR] Tournament[CR]In Tournament two players are pitted against each other in the same fashion as Head-to-Head for a series of five races and whoever wins most races out of the five is declared winner.[CR]Vehicles and Environments[CR]The type of vehicles change, and are fixed for each environment:[CR] Bathtub - Powerboats[CR]These are standard powerboats with standard handling. The Bathtub stages are relatively free of course hazards.[CR] Breakfast Table - Four by Four[CR]A four-by-four jeep like off-roader that controls well over rough terrain. The breakfast table is filled with food spills that the four-by-four has little trouble with.[CR] Desktop - Sportcars[CR]These convertible cars may be small but they do put out a fight with a high top speed and finicky handling. The Desktop environment has a lot of ramps and barricades.[CR] Worktop - Warriors[CR]A group of mean looking cars that look like they come right out of Mad Max. Decent handling and speed but are best suited for bumping each other off the course. The worktop is filled with tools and other impassable objects.Billiards Table - Formula One[CR]Formula One (or open-wheel) racecars, like in real life, sport extremely high top speeds on straights and high acceleration without a compromise on the corners. The billiards table naturally has a lot of pool balls and cues to get in the players' way.Sandbox - Turbo Wheels[CR]Dune buggy vehicles designed for the sandy terrain of the sandbox. Obstacles include buckets and spades.Garden - Choppers[CR]The helicopters have tricky turning cycles but are able to fly over all but the tallest obstacles in the garden course. [CR] Bedroom floor - Tanks[CR]Tanks are slow vehicles with poor turning but have the advantage of shooting one's opponent, forcing them to respawn behind the player's location. The goal of these stages is to stay ahead and elude the shots of those behind them. The bedroom floor stage is filled with toys and other obstacles to use as cover.Backyard - Rufftrux[CR]Huge monster trucks in a special time trial race. Fit through the obstacles to earn a 1up on this stage.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Although the player's character doesn't determine the racing characteristics of their vehicle, the computer A.I. of each character is different. Spider is notably a very fast opponent.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Might and Magic III - Isles of Terra</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The third entry of the Might and Magic series follows the same formula that previous titles had, but in terms of its interface, would settle upon the visual formula that would accompany the remainder of the party based role-playing branch of the franchise. Players can continue to seek out out quests, fight terrible creatures, and explore another vast world laid at their feet.[CR]As with the first game, Isles of Terra continues the tradition of including a full color map of the world that the game was taking place on (in this case, the Isles of Terra).[CR]Aside from the enhancements made to the interface, a new "escape" option was created within the game called "Mr. Wizard". If the player finds themselves lost, they can call upon his services and be teleported to their hometown. The cost, however, is an experience level.[CR]The combat heavy nature of the series continues with this entry although there were many puzzles and secrets to be discovered within the game. Unlike Might and Magic II, Isles of Terra does not offer an option to import characters from its predecessor. Players either start with an all-new party or the pre-built one provided.[CR]Special sub-quests for character classes are also included in the game to enhance their abilities.[CR]As was often the case at this time with the PC related releases of the title (such as on MS-DOS or the Amiga), a number of items were included with the game to enhance its immersion:A journal written by one of the main NPCs, Corak the Mysterious, who describes the mythology of the world, how its races came to be, his own quest, and the origin of each class within the game.A Quick Reference card that describes the basic controls, interface, and listed spells.The map of the Isles of Terra.An adventurer's notepad.[CR]Two new classes also make their debut in this game: the Druid and the Ranger.[CR]The eight default PCs of Isles of Terra all made an appearance in a future Might and Magic game set in the same universe, in a sense concluding their story arc. They appear as high level "travelers" (having arrived from space) in the intro of Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor, and eventually become allies/enemies of the player's party.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story of Might and Magic is a mix of fantasy and sci-fi elements, something that players only discovered once they have fought their way to the end of the previous titles only to discover fantastically advanced super science behind the veil of their respective worlds. Isles of Terra is no different.[CR]At the end of Might and Magic II, the players discover that the world of CRON is actually a massive space-faring colonization vessel developed by powerful beings known only as the Ancients. Sheltem, however, refuses to allow the Ancients to populate CRON as intended, seeing them as inferiors, and decides to send it into the sun instead. Narrowly, the party from that game manages to save CRON although Sheltem escapes.[CR]In Isles of Terra, players must put together a party to stop Sheltem's plan before he completes his quest to destroy that world as well. In it, they discover that Terra was the place where the nacelles of CRON and VARN (the worlds of the two previous titles) were headed in order to colonize it. Following the notes of the mysterious Corak, they discover that the world of Terra is divided into many different islands, towns, and castles, each filled with their own quests. After many harrowing adventures through each one, they finally gain access to the mysterious pyramids that are dotting its surface and discover the true nature of Terra.[CR]Near the end, the party manage to get into the Central Control Center beneath the last pyramid and find that Corak and Sheltem are engaged in a duel to the death. Their arrival manages to distract Corak for a moment allowing Sheltem to slip away into a transport tube. Following Corak's lead, the party discover more of the truth behind the Isles.[CR]Apparently, they were considered "The Grand Experiment" of the Ancients in "using the technology of Elemental Manipulation to create a completely viable ecological and social microcosm. This microcosm was then to be transported to a distant biosphere (Terra) to supplant it's indigneous ecosystem.". The game goes on to describe that the experiment needed a central control capable of handling unexpected anomalies.[CR]It is then that the party discover the truth behind Sheltem: he was created by the Ancients to be the Overlord and Guardian of Terra but his conditioning was critically flawed. He did see himself as the Guardian of Terra, but not of the colonization experiment initiated by the Ancients. As a result, he rebelled against the "army" that "invaded" his world who were actually the colonists. The Ancients managed to contain him, but he had escaped and was determined to undermine the Grand Experiment.[CR]From Sheltem's failure, the Ancients used these lessons to create Corak, a new Guardian. With his conditioning, the Great Experiment was successfully launched on its journey through the Void. Corak was to stop Sheltem and then oversee the colonization of Terra as its Guardian and Overlord.[CR]Sheltem, however, did not see his inability to stop Terra's colonization as a detriment. Instead, he found an opportunity and succeeded in disturbing the balance between the three alignments of men, a balance that Corak must now repair upon his return. However, his plan against Terra only gave him a small sense of satisfaction as he quickly sought to sabotage the other experiments that the Ancients had scattered throughout the Void.[CR]Both Sheltem and Corak have escaped through transport tubes but a third has been prepared for the party to pursue the two to the next world where Sheltem intends to continue his mad quest.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay is centered around a six person party with the world seen from a first person perspective utilizing rudimentary 3D graphics for the outdoor locations and indoor dungeons. Monsters along with certain other encounters are displayed as 2D pictures. As was the norm at the time for several RPG titles, movement is centered around a grid based scheme which meant 90 degree turns and square-based movement forward or back.[CR]The game is also considered quite detailed as well as difficult. Players are required to maintain a stock of food in order to be able to rest outside of an inn to regain hit and spell points. Bashing open locked doors often set off traps if they are not disarmed. Leveling is not automatic.[CR]Once a character has earned the requisite experience, it must be spent at a training ground in order to improve their statistics and abilities. Gems are often required to cast higher level spells and characters can also die from old age (natural or not), although the proper spells could alleviate its effects. Characters can also be afflicted with a number of debilitating conditions which often prove incredibly fatal to starting parties. Sex and alignment can also restrict certain characters from entering specific areas or in equipping certain items.[CR]Isles of Terra also allows the player to save anywhere they wish outside of an inn.[CR]Towns and dungeons are no longer limited by the 16x16 grid although continue to use a grid-based movement system with 90 degree turns. Several other enhancements were also made:Searching is no longer required to find loot following combatVisible enemy encounters give players a chance to avoid unwanted battles or use ranged attacksImproved graphics based on VGA displaysSynthesized speechThe mouse was integrated into the controls (on PCs)Automapping was now providedRaces[CR]The manual of the game took the form of a journal describing the world, its classes, and its races through a fictional story told from the point of view of one of the title's main NPCs, Corak.[CR]The game allows the player to select among five different races in building their characters. As with most other RPGs, certain races have slightly better statistics in certain areas and others, but the emphasis appears to be more on how resistant each one is against certain conditions such as falling prey to sleep spells or being more resistant to poison.[CR]The five races are:Human - Strong resistance to fear and some resistance to sleep spells. Average statistics make this race a good choice without any glaring weaknesses.Elf - They have a strong resistance to fear and are generally excellent at spellcasting.Dwarf - Some resistance to poison, stronger and hardier than the other races. They make excellent fighters but poor spellcasters.Gnome - Nimble and quick, they can make great paladins and decent spellcasters.Half-Orc - They have a moderate resistance to sleep spells, are decently strong, and can make great fighters.Statistics[CR]The maximum value for any one statistic is 18, although this can change depending on several factors based on spells or the effects of certain items. However, if any statistic drops to 0, it will result in immediate death for that character.[CR]The basic statistics used in the game seem derived from the Dungeons and Dragons model of statistics, although carry different names so as to differentiate themselves. They are:Intellect - General knowledge. Important to sorcerers as it can affect spell points. Important to archers later on at higher levels as they begin learning sorcerer spells.Might - Raw strength. Important to any fighting class such as Knights and Paladins. Affects the damage a character can inflict in melee combat.Personality - A character's general degree of appeal to others. Particularly important to clerics as it affects their pool of spell points. Important to paladins when, at higher levels, they begin learning cleric spells.Endurance - Stamina. Affects how many hit points a character initially has to start with and will gain every time they level. Particularly important to fighters.Speed - Agility and general quickness affecting initiative. A faster character improves (increases) their Armor Class rating making them harder to hit.Accuracy - A character's ability to land hits during combat. This is particularly important to archers.Luck - Measures the general chances of a character succeeding when all else seems to have failed. Random and unpredictable.Classes[CR]Several classes are available for players to choose from in building their party of adventurers.Knight - These are considered the warriors of the game in being able to use any item or armor aside from those exclusively designed for another class or have an opposite alignment. They are able to attack more than once every round at higher levels.Paladin - While not quite as good as a Knight in combat, they are able to wield and equip as many items as they can with the same restrictions. At higher levels, they are also able to cast Clerical spells.Archer - These are the missile experts of the party and are able to use any weapon. Unlike the Paladin, they are also able to use missile weapons even in hand-to-hand combat. At higher levels, they are also able to cast Sorceror spells. They are restricted in the kind of armor that they can wear, however, such as chain mail or any lighter armor being the only types available for them and they cannot use a shield.Cleric - The traditional healer class, they can only wear light armor but they can also carry a shield. Weapons are restricted to a club, mace, flail, a staff, or a hammer. They cannot use ranged weapons such as bows. At higher levels, their healing abilities come in extremely valuable much further into the game. They are also the travel experts of Varn with spells that can teleport a party out from a dungeon, to a town for a quick rest, or enable them to walk on water to reach special areas.Sorceror - They can only wear padded armor and their choice of weapons are extremely limited and it almost goes without saying that they can't carry a shield. However, their spells more than make up this lack of physical protection and offensive ability with some of the most devastating attacks in the game.Barbarian - This character can use most weapons and starts with the greatest number of hit points out of any other class. A true tank character.Robber - The traditional thief of the game, what they lack in offensive and defensive ability are made up with their talent for disarming traps and locks. They can fight as well as a cleric, but are far better at keeping the party safe from poison gas or fireballs erupting from chests.Ninja - This character acts much like a fighting Robber, but they cannot carry a shield. They can use most one handed weapons but only swords specific to their class. Two handed weapons are limited to staves and the naginata. However, they do have the "assassinate" ability which is automatically attempted with their first attack. If successful, additional damage will result.Ranger - Can use most weapons and armor along with being able to cast clerical or sorcerous spells to a certain extent.Druid - As with the Sorceror, they are poor fighters. They can only use light armor and weapons but are able to cast Sorceror and Cleric spells, although not to the same extent as those dedicated to such disciplines. They also start with twice as many spell points as Rangers do.Character Status[CR]In addition to their class and race, characters have a number of other statistics that players will need to keep track of during the game.Level - This is a measure of how experienced a character is. Characters start out at level 1 and can only gain levels once enough experience is earned and the necessary training is purchased.Spell Points - A measure of how many points are available to any one character for use with spells. Certain spells have higher point requirements than others.Hit Points - The number of hit points a character has remaining. At zero hit points, a character does not necessarily die. Instead, they fall unconscious. However, if they suffer anymore damage after reaching zero, death is the only result.Armor Class - The higher this number, the more resistant a character is to damage. Armor, spells, shields, and speed are among the factors that can help determine it.Age - Characters start at 18 years of age and grow older as the game continues on. As they become older, their skills begin to deteriorate and vital statistics will begin to drop. After around an age of 80, the character can actually die from resting overnight. Age can be delayed or reversed using spells or in discovering special locations.Experience Points - These are earned from defeating monsters and quests. These determine whether a character is ready to advance to the next level through training. The point requirements for reaching the next level usually double.Gems - This measures the number of gems that a character is carrying. Gems are valuable as they are consumed in order to cast many higher level spells.Gold - The coin of the realm earned in a variety of ways whether it is from monsters or in discovering long lost treasures.Food - Characters start with ten food units (up to a maximum of 40). One food unit represents a day's rations and is consumed when camping to replenish hit points and spell points during rest.Condition - A character's current status, whether they are asleep, poisoned, dead, etc..[CR]Each character also has their own backpack which can carry a maximum of six items.Alignment[CR]There are no absolutes in Might &amp; Magic nor does this affect the story progression of the game. Instead, it largely determines certain restrictions such as whether a piece of equipment can be used or whether a particular character can enter specific areas.Locations[CR]Several towns are scattered throughout the land offering valuable services and even a few side-quests. Due to the open ended nature of the game, the player was not implicitly told where to go, leaving it to their own inquisitive nature to discover where they should head off to next and who to speak to in order to find the next quest. In addition to the towns, many dungeons and secret locations are also scattered throughout the world.[CR]Towns share many of the same services.Shops - Where supplies, such as new armor and food, can be purchased.Temples - Where sick or injured characters can be healed.Training Grounds - Important for advancing character levels once enough experience has been earned.Taverns - Buy food, hear tips, create characters, and manage parties hereBlacksmith - Buy and sell weapons and other items, identify the unidentifiable, and fix what is broken because weapons and armor can break.Guild - Where new spells can be learned once one is at a sufficiently high enough level[CR]Combat[CR]Isles of Terra marks a pivotal change to the combat system of Might and Magic, one that would persist throughout the following chapters of the main series. Options that the first two games allowed the player to use in combat situations, such as bribing encounters to leave them alone or even surrendering, are no longer available.[CR]Enemies are visible allowing the player to attack them at a distance with ranged attacks (such as with bows) or take steps to avoid the confrontation entirely. By using hotkeys or the mouse, the player can easily manage the flow of combat with their favored peripheral.[CR]Once the enemy makes 'contact' with the party by closing the distance to melee, the player has to use one of the button commands on the interface to actually 'Run' from combat. By running from combat, the party ends up somewhere on the map near to where they had fled.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Quick Experience[CR]Find a wagon with all your backpacks filled. The wagon will reappear after it is destroyed. Repeat as necessary.</plot>

				<title_clean>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Based on the popular children's show of the same name, the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers is a 2D side-scrolling brawler developed by Natsume and published by Bandai for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The game allows the player to be any of the five original cast of Power Rangers as they fight through waves of putty patrol and five different monsters created by Rita Repulsa. The game ends climatically with the Power Rangers calling for the Megazord and flying to the moon to battle Rita's overgrown creature in front of her fortress.[CR]While the game's plot doesn't mirror any particular storyline from the live-action series, the game captures many concepts characteristic to the show. Zack is seen dancing during the credits, and incorporates dance moves in his fighting style. Billy, not being a trained martial artist, fights in a cowardly way. Lastly, just like every episode of the show, the game ends with the Power Rangers calling for the Megazord in order to defeat a building-sized monster that Rita grew.[CR]The game is not to be confused with the Genesis fighter of the same name released the same year. While both were released to coincide with the show's run, they both have different genres and were developed by different studios.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]After seeing Rita Repulsa wreaking havoc on Angel Grove, the Power Rangers put it on themselves to protect the city. The rangers fight in a variety of locations, including the city streets and parks, an industrial factory, the sewers, skyscrapers, and a secret underground headquarters. After having the putty patrol and her monsters defeated at the hands of the Power Rangers, Rita resorts to growing one of her minions, named Mutitus. The rangers call for the Megazord, and a giant battle ensues at the shores of Angel Grove. After besting Rita's overgrown creation, the Power Rangers fly to the moon with the Megazord for one last fight against a leviathan called Cyclopsis. Once the rangers have defeated all of Rita's forces, they come back home to a safe Angel Grove. Jason, Zack, Billy, Trini, and Kimberly are seen enjoying their victory with a joyride on the coast of the beach in a convertible.[CR]As the game starts before the Green With Evil arc in the series, Tommy the Green Ranger is not present.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]At the beginning of each level, the player is able to choose any of the five Power Rangers to fight with. The first half of the level consists of the player fighting in civilian form against a variety of putties.

				<plot>This game is loosely based off of the movie of the same name, where the player can take control of either the Yellow, Black, Pink, Blue, Red or White Ranger in a side-scrolling beat-em-up in an attempt to stop the evil Ivan Ooze who is trying to control the universe.[CR]There are six different levels to play in each with their own standard obstacles and enemies, mid-level bosses and of course end bosses that range from Mordant, Lord Zedd to Ivan Ooze himself.  There are no weapons that can be used, instead the player must rely on kicks and punches to dispatch enemies and pick up health items left behind.[CR]Additionally, the Yellow, Black, Pink Rangers are extremely fast and can jump into higher areas but are more weaker than Blue, Red, White Rangers who are much stronger, but lack the speed and jumping abilities of the other Rangers.  Players can refill their health by picking up heart icons and power icons to increase their morphing meter.  Once filled, the morphing meter will increase the Rangers power, attack capabilities, speed and jumping abilities.</plot>

The game varies greatly in visuals, sound, and extras depending on the platform.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Monopoly is a popular board game by Parker Brothers, with a simple object: Be the last player standing by bankrupting all others. The gameplay is simple, in turn, each player rolls the dice, and moves that player's token the indicated number of spaces clockwise. The players can buy properties, railroads, and utilities in an attempt to speed up the bankrupting process. If all properties of a certain color are acquired, a monopoly is gained, and houses and hotels may be built on those properties. These houses and hotels can drastically increase the money others have to give the owner of these properties, or rent. Since there is only one of each deed per game, trading with other places is pretty much vital to winning.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]GET OVER HERE!Mortal Kombat is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Midway in 1992 for arcades. After initial popularity, it was ported to most fourth-generation consoles (in a special event known as "Mortal Monday").The game was controversial due to the combination of excessive gore and violence (including post-battle execution moves known as Fatalities) and fully-digitized character graphics, two concepts that were introduced to the fighting game genre by Mortal Kombat. Originally designed as a video game starring Jean-Claude Van Damme (whose likeness can be seen in the character Johnny Cage), the game introduced a monstrous franchise that spawned a multitude of sequels, a series of comic books, music CDs, a live tour, two television shows, and two major motion pictures (Mortal Kombat and Mortal Kombat Annihilation).The game revolves around the brutal Mortal Kombat tournament held in a hidden island ruled by the evil sorceror Shang Tsung (whose half-dragon, half-human bodyguard, Goro, remains the undefeated champion of the tournament). Each of the seven playable characters enter the tournament for different reasons (some for revenge, while others for glory). The main protagonist is Liu Kang, a Shaolin Monk of the White Lotus society who wants to bring honor back to the Mortal Kombat tournament. The main storyline was expanded through comics and sequels, involving the evil forces of Outworld, who use the tournament in order to take over Earth (known as Earthrealm).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade button layout in the classic "X" formation.Mortal Kombat plays like a traditional 2D fighting game. The 5-button layout was laid out in an "X" pattern and featured High Punch and Low Punch on the left, High Kick and Low Kick on the right, and a dedicated Block button (a first for 2D fighting games) in the middle. Depending on the distance and joystick position, players can perform uppercuts, roundhouse kicks, backhand punches, and leg sweeps. The game introduced special moves that do not require circular joystick movement or holding the joystick in a certain direction. Scorpion's trademark Spear Throw for instance is performed by tapping away from the opponent on the joystick twice, then pressing the low punch button. The game also introduced special moves that do not require any button presses, such as Raiden's Flying Torpedo, performed by tapping away from the opponent on the joystick twice, then tapping towards the opponent on the joystick once.This is the only fighting game in the franchise to include a scoring system (using points) for its high score table. Players earn points by damaging other players, winning a round, and winning the Test Your Might mini-game. The amount of points for winning the round is based on time, amount of damage taken (taking no damage in a round results in a Flawless Victory bonus, while taking no damage in the second round results in a Double Flawless bonus of 500,000 points), and whether or not the player performs a Fatality (which earns the player 100,000 points).FatalitiesFATALITY!One key feature of the fighting game genre made possible (and famous) by Mortal Kombat is the Fatality, which serves as a glorified finishing move that can only be performed upon a losing player at the end of the final round. Fatalities are special button and joystick combinations that are time-restricted. Failing to perform one usually results in the opponent falling unceremoniously to the ground, with the only penalty being a loss of the Fatality bonus. Goro, Shang Tsung, and Reptile do not perform Fatalities, and likewise players can not perform a Fatality on Goro or Shang Tsung. Other than The Pit Stage Fatality, performing a Fatality earns the player 100,000 points. In some home versions, Fatalities are referred to as "Finishing Moves".Simply performing an uppercut (or performing Liu Kang's Fatality) on The Pit will knock the opponent over the side of the bridge, who will then be impaled through the spikes below. This is not available in the Sega Genesis (without the Blood Code activated), Game Boy, Sega Game Gear, or Sega Master System versions.Test Your MightRaiden chopping a pile of wood for bonus points.Every three matches against the CPU opponent or every five matches against human opponents brings the player(s) to a mini-game called "Test Your Might", which requires each player to repeatedly tap certain buttons to build up a yellow bar (which quickly decreases). Once the bar reaches a certain point, the player presses another button to attempt to chop the object placed in front of them. The required point of breakage and points awarded for a successful chop is increased for each level. (100,000 points for Wood, 200,000 points for Stone, 500,000 points for Steel, 750,000 points for Ruby, and 1,000,000 points for Diamond)[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Character Selection Screen with player one as Kano and player two as Sub-Zero.The game includes seven playable characters and two bosses. After choosing a character, the player progresses through the game by defeating all seven combatants (including a mirror match), then progress through three "endurance matches" (in which players must defeat two opponents consecutively to win a round), and then battle the two bosses: Goro and Shang Tsung.Introduced in later versions of the arcade (and the home console ports) is the unplayable Reptile, the third ninja palette swap with moves of both Scorpion and Sub-Zero. He randomly appears before matches to provide clues on how to reach him. If the player can decipher these hints, they will know that Reptile can be fought by performing a Fatality on The Pit stage without taking damage or blocking in the final round, and even then he will only show himself if a shadow appears over the moon in the background at some point during the match. Defeating him earns the player 10,000,000 points.[CR]Johnny Cage[CR](not available in the Game Boy version)[CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaSpecial MovesGreen Bolt - Throws a pale green fireball at the opponent.Shadow Kick - Throws a mid-kick while quickly moving towards the opponent, trailing pale green shadows behind him.Ball Breaker - Performs a split (a la Jean-Claude Van Damme) and punches his opponent's groin, temporarily stunning them.FatalityUppercut Decapitation - Johnny Cage performs a simple uppercut that punches the opponent's head clean off. In the Super Nintendo version, he impales his foot into his opponent's chest (which is later parodied in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks). In the Sega Genesis, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions (without the Blood Code enabled), he just performs a simple Shadow Kick. In the Arcade version, it was possible to reset his Fatality, causing him to knock two heads off his opponent (which is somewhat parodied in Mortal Kombat II).[CR]Kano[CR](not available in the Game Gear and Sega Master System versions)[CR]Actor: Richard DivizioSpecial MovesKnife Throw - Throws a knife (that glows blue) at his opponent.Cannonball - Rolls up into a ball in mid-air and charges towards his opponent.FatalityHeart Rip - Kano shoves his hand into his opponent's chest and rips out the still-beating heart, which he displays in admiration. In the Super Nintendo version and Sega Genesis version (without the Blood Code activated), he just impales his opponent's chest with his fist. In the Game Boy version, he just glides towards his opponent with a kick.[CR]Raiden[CR](known as Rayden in the SNES, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Master System, and PC versions)[CR]Actor: Carlos PesinaSpecial MovesLightning Blast - Throws a bolt of lightning at his opponent.Torpedo - Charges his opponent like a torpedo, chanting nonsensically.Teleport - Phases into the ground and reappears on the other side of the screen.FatalityElectrified Head Pop - Raiden sends jolts of electricity through the opponent's body until the head explodes. In the Super Nintendo version, the opponent is instead electrocuted into a skeleton, which quickly dissolves. In the Sega Genesis, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions (without the Blood Code activated), the electrocution doesn't do anything special to the opponent. In the Game Boy version, Raiden just turns into a pile of electricity and glides towards his opponent.[CR]Liu Kang[CR]Actor: Ho Sung PakSpecial MovesFireball - Throws a red fireball at his opponent.Flying Kick - Performs a quick air kick that launches towards his opponent.FatalityCartwheel Uppercut - Liu Kang performs a cartwheel that ends with a powerful uppercut, sending the opponent flying. Because the developers wanted Liu Kang to be the "hero" character, his Fatality is not considered lethal. (However, it would be lethal on The Pit, as it knocks the opponent over the side of the bridge towards the spikes). In the Arcade and PC versions, it's possible to whiff the cartwheel if the player executes it from a full screen away from their opponent. When this happens, they're free to hit their opponent in any way they see fit, including executing the Fatality a second time. (In the SNES version, however, executing the cartwheel from a full screen away simply causes Liu Kang to cover more distance and come in contact with the victim.)[CR]Scorpion[CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaSpecial MovesSpear - Throws a spear at his opponent. If it hits (and the opponent doesn't block), he shouts "COME HERE!" and drags his opponent towards him, temporarily stunning the opponent.Teleport Punch - Launches himself off one side of the screen and reappears in the other (while throwing a punch).FatalityHellfire - Scorpion takes out his mask, revealing a skull, and breathes fire onto his opponent, who turns into a charred skeleton.[CR]Sub-Zero[CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaSpecial MovesFreeze Ball - Throws a ball of ice at his opponent. If it hits (and the opponent doesn't block), his opponent will freeze in a block of ice temporarily, open for another attack. If he attempts to freeze a frozen opponent, this will trigger a "double freeze", in which his opponent thaws instantly and Sub-Zero himself is temporarily frozen.Slide Kick - Glides towards his opponent, performing a very low kick.FatalitySpine Rip - Sub-Zero grabs his opponent's head, rips it off (spine attached), and displays it towards the camera. In the Super Nintendo version, he jumps back, performs a more potent freeze on the opponent, jumps forward, and punches the opponent, who dissolves into chunks. (This is later improved on in Mortal Kombat II) In the Sega Genesis, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions (without the Blood Code activated), Sub-Zero just performs a more powerful uppercut. In the Game Boy version, Sub-Zero just glides towards his opponent with a punch.[CR]Sonya[CR]Actor: Elizabeth MaleckiSpecial MovesRing Toss - Throws a fireball consisting of three purple rings at her opponent.Leg Grab - Performs a handstand and attempts to grab her opponent with her legs. If it hits (and the opponent doesn't block), she throws her opponent over her with her legs.Square Wave Punch - Jumps straight up, then glides along the air while throwing a punch. (Similar to a square waveform)FatalityKiss of Death - Sonya blows a kiss, which ends up being a fireball that turns the opponent into a charred skeleton.[CR]Goro[CR](sub-boss, only playable in the Game Boy version with a cheat code)[CR] Special MovesFireball - Throws a powerful green fireball at his opponent.Leaping Stomp - Jumps off the top of the screen and lands on his opponent.Chest Pound - Grabs his opponent with his lower arms and wails against the body with his upper arms before throwing the opponent over his shoulder.[CR]Shang Tsung[CR](final boss, unplayable)[CR]Actor: Ho Sung PakSpecial MovesFlaming Skull - Throws a series of flaming skulls at his opponent.Morph - Temporarily transforms to one of the other seven playable characters. In some occasions, he even transforms into Goro.[CR]Reptile[CR](secret opponent, unplayable, not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Master System, and early Arcade versions)[CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaSpecial MovesSpearFreeze BallTeleport PunchSlide KickFatalityHellfireSpine Rip[CR]Arenas[CR]There are six playable stages (seven if the bottom of The Pit for the battle against Reptile is included), which are built into a simple, looping rotation. However, Goro's Lair is always the stage for Endurance 3, Goro, and Shang Tsung matches. The Pit is the only stage that includes a Stage Fatality, which is performed by a simple uppercut.The Pit. You do not want to know what lies below this bridge...The CourtyardPalace GatesWarrior ShrineThe PitThrone RoomGoro's Lair[CR]Versions and Ports[CR]The original arcade release of Mortal Kombat went through five revisions on two arcade boards (the Midway Y-Unit and then the Midway T-Unit). Some additions to the versions include the ability for players to play a mirror match, advertisements for promotional material, more blood, increased opponent AI, and the addition of Reptile.Almost a year later, Mortal Kombat was ported to various consoles (mainly Nintendo and Sega consoles), published by Acclaim. To hype the game's original release on home and handheld consoles, Acclaim launched a marketing blitz that labeled the game's September 13, 1993 release as "Mortal Monday", featuring the iconic Mortal Kombat theme song, known as Techno Syndrome (Mortal Kombat), in advertisements and promotional material.The original arcade release was later bundled with the special edition of Mortal Kombat: Deception for the Xbox and PlayStation 2 and was part of Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play for the PlayStation Portable, Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition for the PC, and Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam).Super Nintendo Entertainment SystemThe SNES version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Sculptured and published by Acclaim on "Mortal Monday". This version was infamous as it did not contain any violence or gore (not even as a secret cheat code), due to the fact that Nintendo preferred family-friendly games for its consoles. The blood was replaced by a mist-like sweat and most Fatalities (known as Finishing Moves) were heavily censored. Anything involving decapitations or organ removal was significantly altered, although Scorpion, Sonya, and Liu Kang did not have any of their finishers censored.Despite the censorship, the game featured better graphics, sound, and music than most of the other console ports. Details such as the character size relative to the screen, the placement of their names within the life bars, and the composition and usage of the score were faithful to the arcade (even though the instrumentation from the SNES audio chip could not be as crisp as provided through the arcade version's sound chips).However, the gameplay was hampered significantly. Control felt relatively stiff, and it was very difficult to pull off basic combos (such as Liu Kang's jump kick into Flying Kick). In some cases, it felt like there was a slight but noticeable lag between a D-pad press and the resulting move on the screen. If you tapped the d-pad too quickly, it was possible to actually attempt multiple inputs without ever seeing a response on the screen (but it also made it possible to do Scorpion's fatality--up, up--without having to hold Block).Sega GenesisThe Sega Genesis version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Probe and published by Acclaim on "Mortal Monday". It also featured censorship of violence and gore (with Fatalities even more censored than the SNES version). However, the game had a famous Blood Code (ABACABB, a nod to the album Abacab by the band Genesis) that, when entered at the right time, would disable all censorship.Despite being the more popular version due to the addition of the Blood Code, the game featured weak graphics and sound, including missing animations (such as Sub-Zero's idle and walking animations, which now mirror Scorpion's) and heavily modified music.Musically, there are stage-specific songs that are used in the wrong stages (and this seems to be something that occurs in most versions ported by Probe, including the PC version). For instance, in the "Palace Gates" stage, which is second in the stage rotation, the music that plays is nothing like what is heard in the original or SNES versions, but in fact sounds like a remixed version of the Continue Screen music. The "Palace" stage music does exist in this version, but is instead used in the "Warrior Shrine" stage (the next stage over).Curiously, not only is "The Pit" stage music completely wrong, it is also the same track that Probe used for the "Palace Gates" stage in the PC floppy disk port.In addition, this version is missing the ominous chime when a Fatality is performed successfully; instead, the stage music continues to play until the animation is over. (The voiceover for "____ Wins" and "Fatality" is also missing.)Game BoyThe Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Probe and published by Acclaim on "Mortal Monday". Due to technical issues, this version of the game is considered the worst due to poor controls and timing issues. The game also lacked Johnny Cage and Reptile, and was censored to contain no blood or gore. However, this is the only version where Goro is made playable through a cheat code.Sega Game GearThe Sega Game Gear version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Probe and published by Acclaim on "Mortal Monday". It resembles much like an improved Game Boy version, featuring faster gameplay, color, and tighter controls. Like the Sega Genesis version, the game was censored until the player enters a hidden Blood Code. Kano and Reptile were absent from the game.Sega Master SystemReleased exclusively in Europe, the Sega Master System version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Probe and published by Acclaim in 1993. The game is the same as the Sega Game Gear version, only with more screen visibility.Sega CDThe Sega CD version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Probe and published by Acclaim in mid-1994, featuring an improved Sega Genesis version (with no censorship and better graphics, music and sound). The game also features video from the "Mortal Monday" advertisements and some tracks from the music CD as bonus content. However, due to the nature of CD-based games, the game suffered from load times (even during endurance matches and the Shang Tsung match). The manual for the Sega CD version also included tidbits from the comic book series.PCThe PC version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Midway and Probe, and published by Acclaim in mid-1994 and is considered the most faithful port in terms of graphics and gameplay. For the floppy disk version, the synthesized music and sounds via Sound Blaster cards were less than ideal; it suffered from melodic inconsistencies similar in nature to the Genesis version. The CD version, however, featured authentic music and sounds and is considered the best home version for its time.AmigaThe Amiga version of Mortal Kombat was developed by Probe and published by Virgin in 1994. The game plays similar to the Sega Genesis version, complete with censorship that can be bypassed with the Blood Code. Due to the limited controls on the Amiga, all moves can be performed with the joystick and one punch button. (Though a second button can be used as a kick button) The game suffered from loading times and a sub-par arranged soundtrack.Plug It In &amp; Play TV GamesIn 2004, JAKKS Pacific released Mortal Kombat as part of their Plug It In &amp; Play TV Games lineup. The port, developed by Digital Eclipse, is a slightly watered-down version of the Arcade version, including cheap MIDI music and lack of scrolling backgrounds and flashing text. The joypad itself resembled a modified Sega Genesis controller with the classic Mortal Kombat 5-button layout. The only way to play two player battles was to connect another copy of the joypad to the first joypad.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Raiden decides to take a vacation.[CR]Mortal Kombat 3 (known in some promotional material simply as MK3) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by  Midway on April 1995 for arcades.[CR]Although not as popular as the previous  Mortal Kombat games (and was criticized by fans due to the change of scenery and bland character roster), the game was a commercial success, adding new gameplay innovations to the franchise such as the Run button, different difficulty ladders, pre-programmed combos,  Animalities, mid-fight stage transitions, a new type of Fatality (the Animality) and special pre-match codes known as "Kombat Kodes". The game was later overshadowed by its upgrade:  Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3.[CR]Taking place sometime after  Mortal Kombat II, the plot of Mortal Kombat 3 revolves around the  Outworld Emperor  Shao Kahn's invasion of  Earthrealm through the resurrection of his wife,  Sindel. Other sub-plots include the creation of the ninja clan  Lin Kuei's "cyber-assassin" program (in which  Sub-Zero refuses to join and becomes marked for death) and  Jax and  Sonya's hunt for the elusive  Kano.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Mortal Kombat "X" Control Panel with the new run button[CR]The gameplay in Mortal Kombat 3 builds upon the gameplay from the first two Mortal Kombat games. Along with four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, Low Kick) and a Block button, the game adds a Run button, which builds upon the offensive game by allowing the player to quickly dash forward. Along with this new button comes a "Run Meter", which limits the use of running.[CR]Mortal Kombat 3 introduces a "chain combo" system in which players can perform pre-programmed combos by linking normal attacks together. These combos cannot be escaped and usually end with either an attack that sends the opponent flying forward, or a launcher that allows the player to further juggle the opponent. Choose Your Destiny![CR]The game also introduces the concept of "Choose Your Destiny", a difficulty selection screen shown before the single player campaign where players can choose between different "towers", each increasing in difficulty. The difficulties included in Mortal Kombat 3 are Novice (in which the player fights six opponents), Warrior (in which the player fights eight opponents), and Master (in which the player fights ten opponents).[CR]In the versus screen before two-player matches, players can cooperatively enter a six-digit code (known as a "Kombat Kode") to modify key gameplay mechanics, fight hidden characters, and read hidden text messages. Gameplay mechanics that could be changed include disabling blocking, disabling throwing, disabling the Run Meter, changing the vitality of a player's life bar, making the screen pitch black, and forcing both players' characters to randomly change every few seconds.[CR]When the  Game Over screen appears after the sole player chooses not to continue, the player the option to enter a ten-digit secret code (known as an "Ultimate Kombat Kode"). Players have little time to input the code (either randomly or figured out through alternate sources). Only one working "Ultimate Kombat Kode" exists in Mortal Kombat 3: the ability to permanently unlock (for that arcade machine) Smoke as a playable character.Finishing MovesANIMALITY![CR] Fatalities,  Friendships, and  Babalities return from Mortal Kombat II. The requirements for performing Friendships and Babalities are now less restrictive (and can only be performed when the player does not press Block during that player's winning round).[CR]Introduced in Mortal Kombat 3 are Mercies and  Animalities. When a player has won a match that went to three rounds, the player has the option to prolong the fight with a special Mercy button combination. (Holding the Run button and pressing Down on the joystick four times when the character is at least a half a screen away) If the player defeats the opponent after showing Mercy, that player has the option to perform an Animality, in which the player transforms into a different animal and kills the opponent. (In a similar fashion to Liu Kang's Dragon Fatality from Mortal Kombat II).[CR]Characters and Actors[CR] The fifteen playable characters (including the space reserved for Smoke)[CR]The game includes fourteen playable starter characters, two unplayable bosses, one playable secret character, and one unplayable secret opponent. Jax, Kung Lao, Liu Kang, Sub-Zero, and Shang Tsung return from Mortal Kombat II alongside Kano and Sonya from the original Mortal Kombat as starting playable characters. Each character from the previous games have a different appearance, such as Jax's metal arms and an un-masked Sub-Zero. Shao Kahn returns from Mortal Kombat II as the game's final boss.[CR]The other playable starter characters include the  palette swaps Cyrax and Sektor (Lin Kuei cyber-assassins sent to kill Sub-Zero), Kabal (a former warrior of Kano's clan), Nightwolf (a North American  shaman), Stryker (a  riot control officer), Sheeva (a female  Shokan warrior), and the resurrected Sindel. Motaro replaces  Kintaro as Shao Kahn's bodyguard and penultimate boss.[CR]The game includes two secret characters, one of which (Smoke from Mortal Kombat II as an indoctrinated cyber-assassin palette swap) is unlocked as a playable character via an "Ultimate Kombat Kode". The other, Noob Saibot (also from Mortal Kombat II), can only be fought through a special "Kombat Kode". Although we're given the impression that Noob Saibot is a ninja (similar to Mortal Kombat II), he is simply a palette swap of Kano in this game. Shang Tsung - John Turk Sindel - Lia Montelongo Jax - John Parrish Kano - Richard Divizio Liu Kang - Eddie Wong Sonya - Kerri Hoskins Stryker - Michael O'Brien Smoke - Sal Divita (secret character) Sub-Zero - John Turk Cyrax - Sal Divita Sektor - Sal Divita Nightwolf - Sal Divita Sheeva - Stop-motion miniature Kung Lao - Anthony Marquez Kabal - Richard Divizio Motaro - Stop-motion miniature (boss, unplayable) Shao Kahn - Brian Glynn (final boss, unplayable) Noob Saibot - Richard Divizio (secret opponent, unplayable)Arenas[CR]There are eleven playable stages (thirteen if Noob Saibot's Dorfen is counted, where the player fights Noob Saibot, and Hidden Portal, where they fight Smoke), which is built into a simple, looping rotation. However, The Balcony is always the stage in Motaro matches and The Pit 3 is always the stage in Shao Kahn matches. The stages that include Stage Fatalities are The Subway (in which the player uppercuts the opponent into the adjacent tracks, who gets run over by a subway car), The Bell Tower (in which the player uppercuts the opponent down the Bell Tower through many floors, who then gets impaled by spikes), and The Pit 3 (in which the player uppercuts the opponent over the side of the bridge and into rotating blades below).[CR]A new addition to Mortal Kombat stages is mid-match stage transitions, where a simple uppercut can knock the opponent up into another stage. The Subway transitions to The Street, The Bank transitions to The Rooftop, and The Soul Chamber transitions to The Balcony. The Subway  The Bank The Street The Graveyard  The Rooftop The Balcony The Bridge The Soul Chamber The Bell Tower The Church The Graveyard The Pit 3[CR]Versions and Ports[CR]16-bit conversions for the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo were released on September 8, 1995, along with a Game Boy version as well. A rare Game Gear version of MK3 was made but only saw a release in Japan and Europe. MK3 was an early member of the Sony PlayStation library, as a 32-bit conversion was released on October 7, 1995, less than a month after the PlayStation launched in North America. As part of its battle with Sega Saturn over the 32-bit market, Sony bought exclusive rights from Midway to release the game on 32-bit consoles. As a response, Sega purchased exclusive 32-bit rights to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. Two versions of MK3 were released for PC. One version was strictly made for DOS. The other version was the PlayStation version ported over for Windows. An emulated version of the game was included on Midway Arcade Teasures 2 for the Xbox, PlayStation 2, and GameCube in 2004. It also was featured on Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play for the PSP in 2005 and Midway Arcade Teasures Deluxe Edition for the PC in 2006. Deluxe featured a 1995 10-minute documentary about the making of the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]At the copyright screen, hold Left and A.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Advertisement featuring four of the new playable charactersMortal Kombat II is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Midway in 1993 for arcades. Like the previous game, it was ported to numerous fourth-generation consoles (and some fifth-generation ones).It is the direct sequel to the original Mortal Kombat, adding new characters and content while revamping the fighting system for a smoother, faster experience. The game introduced multiple Fatalities (gruesome finishing moves) per character, Babalities (finishing moves that humiliates the opponent by turning their character into a baby), and Friendships (finishing moves that trade brutal punishment for a friendly gesture). The game introduces more easter eggs, including a playable version of Pong and the iconic "Toasty!" sound clip. The score system from the original (as well as the Test Your Might! minigame and endurance matches) has been removed in favor of a tally system that tracks the number of consecutive matches won.Taking place sometime after the events of the last Mortal Kombat tournament, the story shifts the location to an alternate realm called Outworld, where it's emperor, Shao Kahn, plans to take over Earthrealm by defeating the warriors of Earth in a tournament (with the help of his half-tiger, half-human bodyguard, Kintaro, and the restored Shang Tsung). Other sub-plots involve Liu Kang's plan for revenge for the assault of his Shaolin monastery (with the help of his close friend, Kung Lao), Jax's mission to rescue the captured Sonya and Kano, and the tensions between female ninja assassins Kitana and Mileena.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mortal Kombat II builds upon the original Mortal Kombat's gameplay. The five-button layout (in an "X" formation) returns, with four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, and Low Kick) and a dedicated Block button. Some normal attacks have different attributes (for example, roundhouse kicks now launch opponents into the air, whether they are on the ground or not), and crouching punches have been added (in the original game, crouching and pressing either punch causes the character to throw an uppercut).Finishing MovesBaraka performing a gruesome new Fatality: the Blade Lift.One significant addition to Mortal Kombat II is the expansion of each character's arsenal of finishing moves. Each of the twelve playable characters now has two Fatalities (glorified execution moves) instead of one (with the exception of Shang Tsung, who has three). Three stages have special Stage Fatalities: The Dead Pool, The Kombat Tomb, and The Pit II. Unlike the original Mortal Kombat (where the Stage Fatality is done with a simple uppercut), Stage Fatalities must be performed with a unique button combination. The button combination for both The Kombat Tomb and The Pit II are unique for each character, with the button combination for The Dead Pool being universal for all characters.Mortal Kombat II introduces two alternate types of finishing moves: Babalities and Friendships. Babalities humiliate the opponent by turning their character into a baby, while Friendships makes the character show a friendly gesture (from autographing a picture to giving a gift). Both can only be performed if the winning player does not press any of the punch buttons during the winning round.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The game includes twelve playable characters, two unplayable bosses, and three unplayable secret characters. All of the previous cast returns except Goro, Kano, and Sonya (though Kano and Sonya are seen as chained prisoners in Shao Kahn's Arena). Most of the cast have received new appearances, special moves, and Fatalities. This is the first game where Reptile and Shang Tsung are playable.After choosing a character, the player progresses through the game by defeating all twelve playable characters (with Shang Tsung always being the last opponent), and then battle the two new bosses: Kintaro and Shao Kahn. Unlike the previous game, there are no "endurance matches" or special mini-games.The new playable characters include Kung Lao (a Shaolin Monk and friend of Liu Kang), Jax (a U.S. Special Forces major who is sent to rescue Sonya), the Tarkatan creature Baraka, and the female ninjas Kitana and Mileena. The two boss characters include Shao Kahn (the evil emperor of Outworld) and his bodyguard, Kintaro. Much like the original Mortal Kombat, the game includes three secret opponents that are palette swaps of either the male or female ninjas: Jade (who can only be fought by winning a round using only the Low Kick button in the match before the "?" symbol), Smoke (who can only be fought by waiting for the "Toasty!" indicator on The Portal stage and pressing down on the joystick and the Start button), and Noob Saibot (who can only be fought by winning 50 rounds in a row). [CR]         Liu Kang [CR]Actor:  Ho Sung PakFatality 1: Liu Kang morphs into a screen-high dragon before biting down on his opponent, leaving behind only a standing pair of legs.Fatality 2:  Liu Kang revisits his non-lethal fatality from the original Mortal Kombat, executing a butterfly-kick into the opponent before uppercutting him or her into the air.[CR]         Kung Lao [CR] (not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Anthony MarquezFatality 1: Using a downward slash, Kung Lao bisects the victim with the brim of his hat. The victim falls to his or her knees before splitting apart down the center in two opposing directions.Fatality 2: Kung Lao throws his hat from a distance with a slight upward arc, catching the victim just under the neck and decapitating him or her.[CR]         Johnny Cage [CR] (not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Daniel Pesina Fatality 1: Cage rips the torso off of his victim and tosses it away, leaving only a pair of standing legs.Fatality 2: Cage revisits his fatality from the original game, using an uppercut to decapitate his victim. A special button combination can be executed during the fatality to guarantee that two more heads are punched off (out of thin air, natch).[CR]         Reptile [CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaFatality 1: Reptile removes his mask, revealing his true reptilian face. He then opens wide, snaring the opponent's head with his long tongue, rips it clean off, and eats it.Fatality 2: While invisible, Reptile pops his victim's torso up into the air and away from the legs.[CR]         Sub-Zero[CR]Actor: Daniel Pesina Fatality 1: Sub-Zero freezes his victim in showers of ice. He then executes a powerful uppercut which causes his victim to explode in a shower of guts, legs and arms. Note: This requires two separate inputs: one for the ice shower, and one for the uppercut. The ice shower can be executed and followed up by any other move, including Sub-Zero's other fatality, if so desired.Fatality 2: Sub-Zero generates an "ice grenade" in his hands, hurls it towards his victim, and waits as the grenade blows his victim's torso into pieces--leaving nothing but a pair of standing legs.[CR]         Shang Tsung [CR] (sub-boss) Actor: Philip Ahn M.D. Fatality 1: Shang Tsung enters his victim's body via the ear canal. Shortly thereafter, he "bursts out" of his victim, causing the body to explode.Fatality 2: Shang Tsung lifts his victim into the air with one hand, sucking out the victim's soul into the other hand. What remains of the victim is a shriveled, desiccated body.Hidden Fatality: Shang Tsung morphs into Kintaro and, with one powerful punch, knocks his victim's torso clean off of his/her legs.[CR]         Kitana [CR]Actor:  Katalin Zamiar Fatality 1: Kitana whips out her razor-sharp fan and decapitates her victim.Fatality 2: Kitana plants a lovely kiss on her victim which in fact causes the victim's body to expand to the point of explosion.[CR]      Jax [CR]Actor:  John Parrish Fatality 1: Jax claps both of his hands on the victim's head, causing it to shatter into pieces.Fatality 2: Jax grabs ahold of both of his victim's arms and rips them off with one yank. The victim then stands in shock as showers of blood gush through his/her arm sockets. The victim doesn't immediately die (of blood loss).[CR]         Mileena [CR]Actor: Katalin Zamiar Fatality 1: Mileena pulls out both of her sai and, in rapid-fire style, repeatedly stabs her victim in the torso, leaving behind a massive spray of blood.Fatality 2: Mileena removes her mask, revealing Tarkatan teeth. She then inhales her victim, then turns around and spits out a plethora of shiny bones.[CR]         Baraka [CR] (not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Richard Divizio Fatality 1: Baraka decapitates his victim with one swipe of his arm blades.Fatality 2: Baraka unleashes both of his arm blades and impales his victim through the chest. As the victim struggles and slowly dies, his/her body slides down the blades before stopping and hanging in the air.[CR]         Scorpion [CR]Actor: Daniel PesinaFatality 1: Reprising his original Fatality, Scorpion removes his mask, revealing only a ghastly skull. He then breaths a ball of fire at his victim, who then bursts into flame--flesh burning away instantly--before exploding into a shower of flaming bones.Fatality 2: Scorpion takes the blade of his spear and slashes open his victim's jugular. As a long river of blood spurts through the neck, Scorpion then follows it up by slicing and separating his victim's torso from the legs.[CR]         Raiden [CR] (known as Rayden in some home versions, not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions) Actor:  Carlos Pesina Fatality 1: Raiden unleashes a powerful uppercut which shatters his victim's body into pieces.Fatality 2: Raiden grabs ahold of and shocks his victim until the body explodes.[CR]        Kintaro [CR](sub-boss, unplayable)[CR]        Shao Kahn [CR](boss, unplayable)[CR]Actor:  Brian Glynn [CR]        Jade [CR](secret opponent, unplayable)[CR]Actor: Katalin Zamiar[CR]        Smoke [CR](secret opponent, unplayable)[CR]Actor: Daniel Pesina[CR]       Noob Saibot [CR](secret opponent, unplayable, not available in the Game Boy, Game Gear, and Sega Master System versions)[CR]Actor: Daniel Pesina[CR]Arenas[CR]There are nine playable stages, which are built into a simple, looping rotation. However, Shao Kahn's Arena is always the stage in Kintaro and Shao Kahn matches. The stages that include special Stage Fatalities are The Dead Pool (where the player uppercuts the opponent into acid), The Kombat Tomb (where the player uppercuts the opponent into previously hidden ceiling spikes), and The Pit II (where the player uppercuts the opponent off the side of the bridge and into the rocky ground below). The Dead PoolThe Living Forest The Kombat Tomb The Wasteland The Tower The Living Forest  The Armory The Pit II The Portal Shao Kahn's Arena [CR]Versions and Ports[CR]The original release of Mortal Kombat II on the Midway T-Unit arcade board went through four released revisions (1.1, 1.4, 2.1, and 3.1). While revisions 1.1 and 1.4 were available to the public, they were considered unfinished, missing some Fatalities, some special moves, all endings, all Friendships, all Babalities, all secret opponents, and all Stage Fatalities. Revision 3.1 is the final version, featuring all Fatalities, special moves, endings, Friendships, Babalities, secret opponents, Stage Fatalities, and bugfixes. The arcade release was considered a smash hit, with special guards on the arcade machines to protect the arcade board from being stolen.Almost a year later, the game was ported to various consoles. Home versions hit the market on &#8220;Mortal Friday&#8221; September 10, 1993 for the Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Nintendo Game Boy, and Sega Game Gear. The SNES version of the original Mortal Kombat was criticized for its lack of blood, so blood was included in the SNES version of MKII. It was featured in the launch library for the Sega 32X when it launched in November 1994. Versions for the PC and Amiga were released in late-1994 as well. Rare versions of the game were released for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1996. The PlayStation version was released only in Japan, and featured excessive loading times. For example, if Shang Tsung morphed into another character, the game would pause mid-match to load this new character, then pause for each consecutive move that required new animations or sound to load in.The original arcade release was later included in Midway Arcade Treasures 2 for the GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition for the PC, Midway Arcade Treasures: Extended Play for the PlayStation Portable, and Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection for the Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), and PC (via Steam). The game was also included as an unlockable in Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox.On April 12, 2007, the game was released on the PlayStation 3 as a downloadable title on the PlayStation Network for $4.99, featuring online play.[CR]</plot>

Mr. Do is capable of digging both horizontal and vertical tunnels. Apart from cherries, the levels also features apples. Apples cannot be collected but will rather fall down once Mr. Do digs sufficient room underneath. Ideally, the apples will squash monsters that mingle right beneath the apple. On the other hand, Mr. Do can also be eliminated when an apple happens to falls on him instead. Pushing the apples around horizontally can also help moving the same into position. Furthermore, Mr. Do can shoot a special "powerball" to eliminate enemies. However, the charge is limited to one shot and Mr. Do will have to wait until the ball bounces back to him until he can use the power again.[CR]The levels are cleared when all cherries are collected, all enemies killed, the five letters spelling E-X-T-R-A (Extra Life) or a diamond is found.[CR]Food[CR]There are many types of food that give you a varied amount of points and send out Pac-Man style ghost enemies that try to kill you!

				<title_clean>Ms. Pac-Man</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The idea of Ms. Pac-Man did not come from Namco, but from hackers. The first version of Ms. Pac-Man was created in 1981 by a handful of programmers at General Computer Corporation. The programmers took a Pac-Man cabinet and modified it, calling it Crazy Otto.[CR]The programmers showed it to Midway who were both surprised at the quality of Crazy Otto and were getting upset over the long wait between the original Pac-Man and its sequel. Midway bought the rights for Crazy Otto and added the Pac-Man sprites and iconic name Ms. Pac-Man to the previously bootlegged game.[CR]Namco quickly took note of Ms. Pac-Man's swiftly growing popularity. Midway had not received consent from Namco to publish the game and a legal battle was about to erupt. Fearing a case would be brought against them, Midway and GCC turned over the rights for Ms. Pac-Man to Namco. Afterward, Namco created numerous ports for the home consoles while benefiting from the widely popular arcade game that was quickly becoming a cultural phenomenon in its own right.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ms. Pac-Man's gameplay does not stray much from Pac-Man's simple mechanics of eating pellets, numerous types of fruit, and power pellets to eat ghosts. However there are a few major changes that would change the gameplay experience between both games.The first such change is that the three intermissions in the game are changed to tell the story of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man's relationship from dating all the way to a stork dropping off their baby.The second change is a minor one; the changing of the orange ghost's name from Clyde to Sue.The ghosts now have movements that are semi-random. Because of this, many players have learned to use a set of moves to avoid the ghosts.The fruit no longer appears and stays in the center of the maze. It instead enters from one tunnel of the maze, travels around, and leaves through the other tunnel if not eaten by the player.The fruit order is now cherries, strawberry, orange, pear, apple, pretzel, and banana. The score for each is also 100, 200, 500, 700, 1000, 2000, and 5000 respectively.The final change is that there are six different mazes. With each of the mazes there are four different colors or styles. Each maze also now has two warp tunnels that will transport the player to the opposite side of the maze.The walls are now filled in (Pac-Man had hollow walls).[CR]</plot>

				<plot>NBA Give 'N Go is a port of the arcade version basketball game. The game is different from usual basketball games of the era because it is played in a vertical view. Most basketball games previously had a side scrolling or isometric view. Building upon this technique, the game features large player sprites and graphics. The game features the NBA roster from 1995 complete with player ratings. Gameplay consists of true 5 on 5 basketball but in a more arcade like style with alley-oops and high flying dunks. The audio includes action oriented commentary, in the style of NBA Jam.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]NBA Jam is a basketball arcade game developed and released by Midway in 1993. It is the first entry in the NBA Jam series and became exceptionally popular in arcades, generating over $1 billion in revenue for the company. Mark Turmell is the game's main programmer and designer, and its gameplay is based on the game Arch Rivals, which Midway released in 1989.[CR]Due to the success of NBA Jam, an updated version of the game called NBA Jam Tournament Edition was released a year and a half later. Featuring updated rosters and adding a number of new features to the series. Midway also used the success of NBA Jam to apply the over-the-top nature of the game to other sports. For example, Midway went on to create NFL Blitz, an over-the-top version of American football, in 1997.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]NBA Jam is a 2-on-2 arcade-style basketball game that features over-the-top gameplay. The exaggerated nature of the gameplay means that players can perform gravity defying dunks with ease and shove opposing players down without penalty. Each game consists of four 3 minute long quarters, and the team with the most points at the end of the fourth quarter wins the game. When starting a match players have the option to enter their initials in order to keep track of their win-loss record and teams that they have beaten.[CR]The only fouls a player can commit in NBA Jam are goal tending and shot clock violations. This means that the player can shove opposing players (and even his own teammate) down in order to get the ball without commiting a foul. A shot clock is present in order to keep the game moving at a fast pace and goal tending is used to prevent players from hoarding the basket while on defense.[CR]A trademark of the NBA Jam series is the ability for players to catch on fire. This occurs when a player makes three consecutive unanswered shots. While on fire the player is nearly unstoppable; the player is granted unlimited turbo, increased accuracy, and can't be called for goal tending. A player's fire goes out when the opposing team makes a basket.[CR][B]Teams:[/B][CR]*Note: The arcade version features teams from the 92-93 NBA season, while the home version include players from the 93-94 season. Shaq only appears in the arcade version of the game, he does not appear in the home versions of the game because the cost to renew the right to license him was deemed too high.[CR] Easter EggsDra&#382;en Petrovi&#263; haunts the arcade version of NBA Jam, allegedly.Dra&#382;en Petrovi&#263; died in a car accident between the game's home version port. It is believed that he haunts the arcade version of the game by causing the announcer to call his name out at random.NBA Jam is well known for featuring many odd hidden characters that can be unlocked via the game's initial entry. The home versions of the game added "celebrity" characters, while the arcade release focused more on the team responsible for developing the game. Unlockable players include:Bill ClintonAl GoreSal DivitaMark TurmellNBA Jam also includes cheats that enhance a players stats, these include: always on fire, infinite turbo and super dunks.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>NBA Jam - Tournament Edition</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]NBA Jam Tournament Edition is the second game in Midway&#8217;s basketball arcade series, featuring two-on-two fast paced matches with NBA players from the 1993-94 season (1994-95 on consoles). In total, the game featured over 120 NBA athletes and over 40 hidden characters. Improvements include additional power-ups, more detailed player attributes, player substitutions after each quarter, and a new soundtrack. The namesake "Tournament Mode" turns off all cheats and powerups, and rewards players with expanded rosters for nearly all teams if the player beats all 27 teams.[CR]In addition to these features, console releases added practice and &#8220;juice&#8221; modes, optional game toggles like "hotspots" and powerup icons, and an "injury" stat that lowers a character's stats. Later console releases ( Jaguar, Saturn, PlayStation) also featured larger character sprites and scaling effects to match those of the arcade version.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The core gameplay is largely unchanged from the original NBA Jam. Players still have the ability to do all the crazy dunks from the original, and all actions (running, passing, shooting) can be enhanced by holding down the "Turbo" button. Turbo drains while active, and replenishes quickly when not in use. Players also have the series-staple ability to go on fire after making 3 unanswered scores in a row - giving the player temporary unlimited sprint and the ability to goal tend without being penalized. Small, but significant changes in the T.E. include slightly improved A.I., game speed, new dunks, and court changes matching the color of the home team. Up to four players can play at once, with the A.I. filling in any empty slots.More stats in the T.E.[CR]The most significant changes in the Tournament Edition are expanding each player's stats, and expanding each team's roster to three players (with some exceptions due to trades or retirement, such as Dallas, which only has two players). Players are graded from 0 to 9 in eight categories: Speed, Dunk, 3-Point, Block, Power, Clutch, and Pass. Stats directly affect a player's success for each particular action, and players can be substituted out at halftime to respond to the changing needs of the game. For example, the player would send in a player with high Power and Pass ratings if ahead, to minimize getting shoved or picked and secure your lead. If trailing in the 4th, send in players with a high Clutch rating. These changes bring an added level of strategy somewhat missing from the original.[CR]Every version of the game also contains the Tournament Mode, where all cheats, powerups, and special characters are disabled. Players are challenged to beat all 27 NBA teams, with progress stored to their initials (inputted at the start of the game). If a player beats all challenging teams, they unlock new characters and challenges. In the Arcade version, this unlocked the "???" team for play, consisting of NBA All-Stars and secret characters. These characters would also populate opposing teams, and always come with the "Quick Hands" and "Max Power" powerups (except in Tournament Mode). On consoles, beating Tournament Mode unlocked 2 new players for almost every team's roster, plus a new difficulty level.[CR]All versions of the game also included "Powerup" codes input at the Tonight's Matchup screen. These were secret combinations of button presses and stick moves that granted abilities akin to cheats (such as infinite turbo and power dunks). Playing in Tournament Mode disables these.[CR]An owner dipswitch option in the arcade allowed the winning team out of a game of four players to continue playing for free, adding extra incentive to beat any challengers lined up.ConsolesHotspots enabled[CR]Some additional modes were added for console releases, and could be individually toggled in the options screen off the main menu. "Hot Spots" place marked circles randomly around the court and reward the player with extra points (up to a 9-point shot) for sinking a basket while standing inside them. Each spot clearly displays its value within the circle. "Power-up" icons add randomly-appearing icons around the court that bestow an effect when touched (such as enhanced accuracy, instant "on fire," or an earthquake knocking down all other players). Finally, some releases included a "Juice" mode that increased the game's speed by a factor of four. Once again, playing in Tournament Mode disables all of these.[CR]The console releases also added an "Injury" stat for each player. This stat would increase as the player was repeatedly shoved to the ground, and decrease all his other stats proportionally. Substitutions were also increased to each quarter, encouraging injured players to be swapped out for a quarter and come back refreshed. It also added a further layer of possible tactics, as a strong player could be shut down with repeated shoving.[CR]Console releases also include an optional "Tag Mode" where you always control the player holding the ball. Passing to a player switches control to that player as soon as the ball connects. This mode can be helpful for anyone not content with the A.I. teammate's handling and decisions.Computer AI Analysis[CR]The computer artificial intelligence seems to have two different modes. In one mode (mostly seen in early tournament matches) the computer adopts a more passive defensive strategy. They will rarely ever try to push the player over, and the player can often simply run the length of the court and put up a three, or go for an easy dunk without ever worrying about passing. On offense, they tend to often go for three pointers, and will almost always make them if the player doesn't steal or block the ball first (especially if the player is ahead in score). The AI will rarely ever go inside the paint for a lay up or a dunk in this mode.[CR]In the second mode (mostly seen in later tournament matches) the computer is much more aggressive. They will often try to push the player over, making it almost impossible to progress the ball up the length of the court without passing the ball to the other player frequently. Also, if the player tries to put up a three, they will almost always get shoved by the opposing computer controlled AI player if he is nearby. This makes it hard to get three pointers up, and the player can end up getting pummeled if they do not pass frequently. On offense, the AI will frequently go for dunks and attack the paint. However, if the player leaves them wide open on the perimeter they will pull up a three and make it almost all the time.[CR]In general, AI in the first mode is much easier to deal with than the aggressive second mode. The one advantage the first mode has to the second mode is on the offensive side because they will often go for three pointers and will make them almost all the time meaning they can come back quickly if the player is sloppy on the offensive end. However, because of the second modes extremely aggressive defensive, it is more often than not much harder to deal with. Though if the player can manage to get a huge lead on them, it is a lot harder for this mode to make a come back because they often don't put up three pointers.Always going for dunks is a good strategy when in the lead[CR]However, it is hard to get a big lead on either types of AI because of the Rubber Band AI effect. As the player's lead grows, the probability of making shots becomes progressively lower, while the AI's probability of success progressively increases. One strategy to deal with this is to always go for dunks when you start to get a lead bigger than two possessions (4 points), because dunks have a very high probability of going in. Likewise, never go for three pointers because the probability of a three pointer going in is very small when you have a lead. Also increasing your defense on the perimeter is recommended because the computer's probability of making a three pointer when you have a big lead is nearly 100%. This is why the second computer AI mode is easier to get a big lead on because they tend to not go for three pointers and have tougher defense on the perimeter than they do in the paint.[CR]It is interesting to note that if, in the last seconds before half-time or the end of the match, the computer has the ball and they throw up a full court shot it will always go in (a 100% probability) regardless of the score, but if they advance the ball to half court and shoot it from there their probability of making the shot is significantly reduced. For the player, the probability of making a full court shot is very small, giving the computer a competitive edge at the end of the game. Also in the last ten seconds before halftime or the end of the game the computer will become extremely aggressive (even more so than the second AI mode) regardless of the type of AI the player may be facing. If the player has the ball the computer will sprint full speed towards him/her and try to steal the ball and take a quick shot. So if the player is not careful, the computer can score 4 or 6 points in the final 10 seconds using quick steals and shots.[CR]Teams and Players[CR]NBA Team RostersKevin WillisAtlanta Hawks: Stacey Augmon, Mookie Blaylock, Kevin WillisBoston Celtics: Dee Brown, Dino Radja, Dominique Wilkins ( Xavier McDaniel, Eric Montross)Charlotte Hornets: Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Alonzo Mourning ( Dell Curry, Hersey Hawkins)Chicago Bulls: B.J.

				<title_clean>NBA Showdown</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]NBA Showdown is an NBA licensed basketball game from EA Sports. It is the fifth and final game in EA Sports's NBA Playoffs series, before EA's NBA franchise was relaunched as NBA Live. The game was released in Japan as NBA Pro Basketball '94: Bulls vs Suns. The game was originally released on the Super Nintendo in October of 1993, and was ported to the Sega Genesis the following year with the title NBA Showdown '94.[CR]Officially licensed by the NBA, it was one of the few early basketball games to feature every NBA team of the '93-'94 season. It also allows for a full 82 game season. Its successor was the first NBA Live game, NBA Live 95.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]In reviewing the SNES version electronic Gaming Monthly gave a review score of 7 out of 10. Mike Weigand wrote, "may have been really somthing if it wasn't for the choppiness during game play -- it totally interrupts the game play at times and can be rather frustrating. However the ability to switch between players during the game, and other actions, are simple to execute".[CR]</plot>

The game has no stands, no fans and no backdrop; it only has a court, the players, a basket at each end and a blue background. The camera rotates around to follow the athlete controlling the ball.[CR]NCAA Basketball was considered groundbreaking upon its release. Many games would later follow its example and feature camera perspectives that followed the player with the ball.[CR]In the North American version of the game the teams were chosen from actual NCAA (National Collegiate Athletics Association) basketball teams. In Japan the game is called Super Dunk Shot and has fictionalized versions of NBA teams.The European version, dubbed World League Basketball, includes fictional teams from across the globe.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 20 second halves[CR]On the Game Options menu following the title screen, enter the following code: right, right, left, left, right, left, right, left, right, right, right, right, left, left, right, left.

				<plot>Newman Haas Indy Car is, as the name shows, a racing game endorsed by the CART racing team of the same name and their top driver at the time, Englishman Nigel Mansell. [CR]The player has the option to drive a single race (where the option to practice is hidden) or go for the crown against 12 other drivers in 15 tracks (with some variety, not only ovals) across North America, with the season opener in Queensland, Australia. It is possible play solo, with a friend in split screen or with split screen against the computer, and if music or engine sounds are played in the race.[CR]A key choice in the game is selecting between Arcade and Simulation mode - in the later, the car can take a lot less damage before giving up, fine-tuning must be done by the driver and rules are enforced, under the risk of a disqualification.[CR]Graphically, the game is less sterile than most driving games of the platform (and in 16-bit consoles, generally), thanks to the inclusion of several polygonal buildings scattered around the circuits.</plot>

				<title_clean>NFL Football</title_clean>
				<plot>It's very simple... the NFL is football and this is the only officially licensed NFL game for the NES... the closest thing to 'real' professional football that you can play without a helmet and shoulder pads. You can select any of the American and National Conference teams, and if you're good enough, you can take them all the way to the Super Bowl! Team rosters are broken down into positions and individually rated according to skills, with position upgrade packages, player ability handicapping, actual NFL Offensive and Defensive Playbook alignments with audibles and even variable wind direction and strength. You not only coach from the sidelines, you also control all the movements of the players on the field. Run, pass, catch, kick, punt, jump, tackle, block and dive... Refs even call penalties. No matter what kind of fan you are, whether you know the rulebook inside-out or just watch an occasional game on TV... this is the one football game you've got to have!</plot>

				<title_clean>NHL '94</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]NHL 94 is a vertically oriented ice hockey simulation based on the game engine behind NHLPA 93. NHL 94 makes playable all NHL teams (active at the end of the 1993 season), complete with robust (though incomplete) player rosters, in addition to the East and West conference All-Star teams. Various players attributes (e.g. speed, aggression, shot) are ranked based on a 100 point system and affect the way players perform in the game.[CR]New Features Introduced[CR]These features were added from EA Sports previous game NHLPA 93:Goalie ControlShootout GamePenalty ShotsBench and Board Checks3 or 4 Player Compatible with Adapter (5 players on SNES)1992-93 Player Ratings &amp; RostersVariable Player Ratings when on Hot/Cold StreaksSave Player Records for each playerSave User Standings and RecordsOne-times and Special Moves by Selected PlayersNew Player StatsFlip PassesReverse-Angle ReplayClear the zone while killing penaltiesAutomatic Line Changes (can manually change lines at play stoppage)Tougher Computer DefenseTougher GoaliesComputer Shooting Scoring MovesPlayer and Team CardsPlayer Profiles with 144 Player PicturesLogan Organ Music matches Home ArenaTeam logos at center iceNew crowd animationsNo fighting or bloodPeriod StatsMore kinds of game statsTwo expansion teams (Anaheim and Florida)[CR]Innovation[CR]NHL 94 has been lauded as one of the best sports games ever made. It improved on the innovative NHLPA 93 engine, adding smoother sprite animation and a host of new gameplay mechanics. Perhaps the most important of the newly introduced gameplay features was the ability to perform a one-timer. (For non-initiated, a one-timer is when you pass the puck to a player and the intended recipient shoots the puck immediately, without pause.) The one-timer proved to be one of the most accessible scoring options in the game. Scoring was also made easier by the inclusion of a more robust deke mechanic with NHL 94 (at least in the SNES version of the game). In addition, gamers were also able to save their user records.[CR]NHL 94 also evolved from its predecessor by reducing the frequency of slap-shot goals scored through the goalie&#8217;s five-hole and stopping the ability to run into the goalie and have the puck your player was carrying drift into the net. Perhaps the most conspicuous feature included in NHLPA 93 and omitted from NHL 94 was the ability to fight your opponents. Fighting returned with NHL 95.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]Regular SeasonPlayoffsBest of Seven PlayoffsShootoutExhibition[CR]NHL Teams &amp; Rankings[CR]The following is a chart of the 26 NHL teams featured in NHL 94 and their rankings, strengths and weakness. These stats appear in the manual and the Team Selection screen.

The main menu looks rather different from one version to the next, the SNES version adopting a much more basic design. There are also slight graphical differences during gameplay. Possibly the most significant difference is that the SNES version will not track players' statistics from one game to the next (for example, to see which player on your team is leading in goals scored during playoff mode).[CR]Ron Barr's Quotes[CR]Welcome to a sold out {insert arena], home of the [insert home team]Hi I'm Ron Barr for EA Sports... and in goal tonight [goalie name] for [team] and [goalie name] for [opposing team]For [team name], [player name] is on a hot streak, but [player name] is on a cold streak.The [arena] crowd record is [number] db.Hit the Start button to begin, Use the A and C to cycle through menus.Lately [team name] has been playing well ...

However do to copyright, lacked the official NHL rosters of the time. There was also a European version of the game released as NHL Hockey 91.[CR]Cover Athletes[CR]Tomas Sandstrom of the Los Angeles Kings shooting against Andy Moog of the Boston Bruins.[CR]Cheats for Sega Genesis Release[CR]30 Second Periods: Hold A C when you turn on your Sega Genesis and do so until you get to the Edit Lines Screen, you should see a :30 time on your periods.Instant Healing: If a player gets injured, pause the game and then take a time out. The injured player will return to the game with full health.Edit Other Teams: If you are the home team, you can edit the other players lines.[CR]PC Release System Requirements[CR]Minimum CPU Class Required: 80396Minimum OS Class Required: DOS 4.0 to 6.22Minimum RAM Required: 2 MBMedia Type: 3.5 " Floppy Disk, CD-RomMinimum CD-Rom Speed Required: 1XVideo Modes Supported: VGASound Devices Supported: Adlib, PC Speaker, Roland MT-32, Sound BlasterInput Devices Supported: Gravis Gamepad, Joystick (Analog), Keyboard, Mouse[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the game scores of 9,8,8,8. Ed Semrad wrote, "... a must for any sports fan. EA is getting closer to making the ultimate hockey game". Mike Weigand wrote, "...Loads of new features have been added to NHL '94. Now there are four players with 2-on-2, or any combination you may like. Other new features include real players' stats from the previous season, including faces and streaks. They also have the new logos and each team's rink music.

				<plot>NHL 96 was the first EA Sports game to feature Virtual Stadium technology, which resulted in a 3D feel and multiple camera angles. The NHL license ensures that real teams and players of the era are included, with a full league and playoff system. Many game options can be toggled - the infamous fighting is option, as are the penalties and offsides. The control system makes it possible to execute one-touch passes, and several special trick moves to quickly advance the ball. As a bonus feature, it included 'Hockey Card' profiles of every player on CD, and interviews with the stars of the game.</plot>

				<plot>[CR]This is EA's yearly NHL franchised hockey game.   [CR]Improvements[CR] For the first time, EA's NHL series included National Teams.  Although they could not get the official Nagano Olympic license, they were able to have national teams with corresponding rosters. EA introduced for the first time in their NHL series 3Dfx Glide support which dramatically changed their graphics from previous years (although the SNES and Genesis versions of the game continued to look like the previous 2D games) [CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]Exhibition - single game, pick your team and your opponent and face against the computer or friend.Season - You can play all 82 games of the 1997-98 NHL season, trade players, sign free agents and go through the ups and down of a full season.Practice - Try situations like penalty kills, power plays, odd man rushes.  Select how many players you want versus how many players the opposing teams have.Skill Challenge - Try some of the challenges that have been made popular with the NHL's All Star game, such as faster skater, accuracy shooting, skating around cones and 2 on 0 goalie scenarios.Shoot Out - One on One, goalie versus a skater on a breakaway.[CR]Teams &amp; Rankings[CR] In addition to the then 26 NHL Teams (before Atlanta Thrashers, Nashville Predators, Columbus Blue Jackets and Minnesota Wild), two All Star Teams and only 3 National Teams (United States, Canada, Europe).

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]3D perspective during gameplay[CR]NHL Stanley Cup is a hockey game developed by Sculptured Software (which later became Acclaim Salt Lake City). NHL Stanley Cup had the licence to use the logos and names of all 26 NHL teams as well as the Stanley Cup itself. However, lack of a licence from the NHLPA prevented use of actual player names.[CR]NHL Stanley Cup employed a unique, 3D perspective where the camera was positioned behind the back of the puck holder. This allowed the player to see down the ice, all the way to the net. If the puck is taken by the opposing team, the camera rotates around to position itself behind the new puck holder.[CR]Game Modes and Options[CR]Title screen showing game modes[CR]The game had three difficulty settings, including Junior, NHL, and NHL Pro. Other options included different period lengths and turning penalties and line changes on or off. The player could also choose between playing a single exhibition game, a best-of-seven series, or a complete season. During season mode, the game kept track of player and team statistics. The player could choose not to play particular games and instead have the outcome determined by the computer. At the end of the season, the player could qualify for the playoffs and compete for the Stanley Cup. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Face off at center ice[CR]Apart from the unique camera angle, the gameplay in NHL Stanley Cup was fairly standard for its time. When the player has control of the puck, they can skate, shoot, pass, or dump the puck into the opposing zone. When shooting, the player could actually aim shots to specific parts of the net or choose to fake a shot. On defence the player can perform poke checks, hip checks, and shoulder checks. At any time, the player can make line changes or choose to pull the goalie.[CR]The rules of the game conformed fairly well to the standard rules of actual NHL hockey. Players could be called for a variety of penalties, and would be sent to the penalty box accordingly.[CR]One of the more noticeable gameplay flaws was the players ability to score almost score at will, when approaching the blue line in the middle of the ice, the player could hit the button to dump the puck effectively popping it up into the air over the goalie's head.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>NHLPA Hockey 93</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]NHLPA Hockey '93 is an EA Sports hockey game for Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis. This game only features an NHL Players Association license: all the players names are present yet none of the actual NHL team names and logos appeared. All of the team's cities and colors however are exact, although the New York Islanders are referred to as Long Island. NHLPA Hockey '93 was the first title to feature Tampa Bay Lightning and Ottawa Senators again though they lacked the team names and logos.[CR]The Genesis version also included EEPROM battery saving, which allowed one to save lines and the ongoing playoff, rather than the passwords of the SNES version.[CR]The game's ruling towards a number of things such as breaking glass, bleeding and injuries caused controversy among hockey fans. The booklet suggested that injuring top players from the other team "with an extra hard body check" was "part of the game". All these features were removed from following titles, besides injuring.[CR]This is the game with the famous wrap-around trick. When shooting downwards, if the player performs a wrap-around starting from the right side of the net, the goalie will get stuck on the far right leaving the goal net wide open.[CR]NHLPA Teams and Rankings[CR]There are 26 total teams in NHLPA Hockey '93. When picking teams, Team 1 defaults to Pittsburgh while Team 2 defaults to Chicago. Team 1 is the home team controlled by Player 1 while Team 2 is the away team controlled by Player 2 or the Computer.Team NameShootingSkatingPassingDefenseCheckingFightingGoalkeepingPower Play Adv.Home Team Adv.OverallAll Stars East99999092-9All Stars West9999909209Boston6766675346Buffalo24423933-3Calgary4334482223Chicago77779882-8Detroit8879787218Edmonton65354533-4Hartford2222134412Long Island54555232-4Los Angeles5664653025Minnesota12321652-2Montreal7888849139New Jersey86686461-7New York7989778049Ottawa11111414-1Philadelphia3443235323Pittsburgh55665721-5Quebec3212132241San Jose21113212-1St. Louis4364456044Tampa Bay21111413-1Toronto2123323212Vancouver68777572-7Washington9697845208Winnipeg45552182-5[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Genesis version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 8,9,8,8 adding, "...this version rewrites what the best should be. Better sounds, faster and more controllable game play now correct what was lacking in the first game. The two player action is the best I have ever seen! Where does EA go from here?".[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Goal[CR]Skate behind the opponent's net, and go left to right. The goalie will be stuck on one side.

				<plot>Nickelodeon GUTS is based off of the Nickelodeon TV show in the late 90's that is basically American Gladiators for kids.  The events in the game are based off of the actual game show events with the main goal being to score as many points as possible while trying to beat the clock.[CR]In Elastic Sports, the player is strapped onto a long bungee cord and is bounced around.  There are three events: Slam Dunk is a basketball game, Attack is lacrosse and Spiral where the objective is to throw a football through a hanging tire.[CR]Action Sports is an obstacle course which someone would find at a boot camp and is divided into two events:  Basic Training involves poles, swinging ropes and punching bags and Tornado Run which adds water jets and moving platforms.  Players can also pick up bonus items that will add time or replenish health and a chance at the bonus round.[CR]The final event is the Aggro Crag which is a giant indoor mountain the player must climb while avoiding various obstacles such as confetti cannons, moving platforms and smoke vents.  The goal of this event is to navigate the mountain and activate five different sensors located on the mountain before being able to activate the last one at the very top of the mountain.[CR]There is also an option for two friends to compete either head-to-head or alternating depending upon the event.  Elastic lets the players compete against each other on a split-screen while Action Sports and the Aggro Crag has to be played through alternating play.</plot>

				<plot>Nigel Mansell's F-1 Challenge is a Super Famicom game that takes places in the Formula One circuit. The player can race a single race, do a season of Formula One, or practice their skills on a particular race track. Either music, sound effects, or both can be shut off on the options menu. The changing of the tires is mandatory on pit road during the middle of each race, and weather can determine whether the player should use hard tires, soft tires, or rain tires.[CR]Being licensed by Mansell, the game followed the 1992 Formula One season, which he won. The player takes on Mansell's role to try and win the title again, against eleven other drivers. Like Sega's own Super Monaco GP, each of them belongs to their own team (instead of common F1 format of two drivers per constructor), however all are real-life drivers.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Final Level Passwords:[CR]Enter the following code at the Password screen....[CR]X4LWJ01XN6LW0D3KVY[CR]See the ending[CR]Enter the password: P V 2 J T F B K 4 Y 6 9 6 H 4 D X Y[CR]View Credits[CR]Enter the following code at the Password screen....[CR]VM. 20HQDMSN0QWLT2Q[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Mansell%27s_F-1_Challenge[CR]</plot>

The game was released for the         Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1995, developed and published by        Tecmo. There were many changes made to the games beyond graphical updates. Due to       Nintendo's family friendly policy, several instances of blood or religious material (pentagrams, specifically) were removed. Ironically, some lines were altered from their previously censored version, adding words such as "damn" that were previously unseen. The difficulty in Ninja Gaiden III was altered to be slightly easier and more reasonable, and several music tracks were changed.Ninja Gaiden     A boss fight at the beginning of the first game The first game in the series and the first in the compilation was originally released in 1988.      Ryu Hayabusa is the star of Ninja Gaiden, as he searches for his missing father, Ken, in the United States. Ryu first meets a Dr. Smith, as instructed in a note from his father. Smith talks about two demon statues that have the power to summon an ancient devil and possibly end the world. One of the statues is stolen, Ryu is contacted by the CIA, and Ryu ends up traveling to South America to track the statue down, as well as the leader of an evil cult (known as     Jaquio), who is intent on resurrecting the demon. In the end, Ryu manages to defeat Jaquio, and is reunited with his father.        Ninja Gaiden II  JaquioThe Dark Sword of Chaos continues the plot of Ninja Gaiden. Ryu gets word of a villain named Ashtar (the Emperor of Chaos and mentor to Jaquio). Irene Lew, the CIA agent that Ryu worked with in the first game is kidnapped by Ashtar. Ryu's main goal is to track down both the weapon forged from a bone of a demon (the Dark Sword) as well as Irene Lew. After facing Ashtar and defeating him, Ashtar sends Irene, the Dark Sword, and Ryu into the Realm of Chaos with his dying breath. Here, Ryu finds a resurrected Jaquio, who he manages to defeat once and for all.Ninja Gaiden III     Irene LewThe final game in the trilogy actually takes place sometime between the events of the first and second game, and involves a mystery in which Ryu is framed for the murder of Irene Lew. Ryu discovers that two CIA agents (Clancy and Foster) were involved in a paranormal experiment involving the energy created when Ryu defeated the demon in the first game. This experimentation resulted in the creation of several doppelgangers, or "bio-noids," one of which appeared to be Ryu Hayabusa. It was this one that murdered Irene Lew. After uncovering this entire plot, Ryu fights both the bio-noids, Foster, and Clancy, ending in an epic confrontation in the Ship of Doom (an incredible warship which has the sole purpose of the destruction of humanity), where Ryu destroys the ship and kills everyone involved in the bio-noid plot.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The evil Banglar and his armies have finally crushed the rebels, yay! No wait, the rebels are the good guys. Oh well, the good guys can't win 'em all. But do not fret, the rebels made three experimental androids that are now programed to assassinate the evil Banglar (don't ask me who programed them, with the rebels dead).[CR]Ninja Warriors is a good video game that is actually the sequel to an arcade model of the same name. The game itself is rather different when it comes to gameplay. For instance, rather then moving up steps and jumping onto platforms, the game now involves side-scrolling action that keeps you on the same level.[CR]The graphics of this game are rather good, with explosions and parts of the background that can be destroyed. The music is good as well, with different tunes for all eight levels and additional scores for the bosses. This game is a beat'em-up at it best, with no thinking involved, just straight beat'em-up.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]Ninja Warriors is a beat'em-up game in which three android ninjas- Ninja, Kunoichi and Kamaitachi- must fight their way through eight levels in order to get the evil Banglar. Each ninja has different attacks: Kunoichi uses knives and a sword, Ninja uses his fists and nunchuks, and Kamaitachi uses sickles that are attached to his arms.[CR]Each android is also equipped with a blast that knocks everyone down. Fight through each level to get the boss at the end, which is a robot that progressively gets harder as you go up in levels. Sometimes you will be faced off with two large robots. Along with the bosses, there are smaller enemies that you will have to fight as well. The Bosses are larger robots in the sense that they are bigger then you; and watch out, because some of them have special abilities like turning invisible and launching rockets. The best strategy is to run in and beat the crap out of them as quick as you can. Defeat the robots and watch them blow apart with a pretty cool graphics display.[CR]Scattered around each level are objects that you can pick up and throw at enemies. Be sure to keep an eye on your health which is at the bottom of the screen; if it runs out, you blow up. Don't worry, though, you can pick up energy packs along your way, and if that fails you have unlimited lives, and you get the chance to choose another of the three androids or keep the same one. All in all, this game is worth playing and beating, considering that you can keep playing without running out of lives. So plug in and play away!

				<title_clean>No Escape</title_clean>
				<plot>Based on the 1994 movie of the same name starring Ray Liotta, the player takes control of Liotta's character, Capt. J.T. Robbins, whose only objective of the game is to escape an island. After shooting his commanding officer, Robbins is imprisoned and eventually sent to the island Absolom as a war criminal, from where there is no escape possible. To do this still, the player must explore the island with side-scrolling platform gameplay for clues, finding items and combining them to make weapons and traps.  [CR]Robbins can talk to some prisoners to help him in his quest, but he must also avoid violent prisoners, either by attacking them with punches or kicks or using traps and stealth to bypass them. The graphics are based off of rotoscopes of the actual actors from the movie.</plot>

				<title_clean>Nobunaga's Ambition</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The title screen.[CR]Nobunaga's Ambition is a historical simulation-strategy game that was developed by Yoichi Erikawa, the co-founder of Koei (along with his wife Keiko Erikawa). Erikawa had initially developed the game as a hobby alongside running Koei, which at the time was a chemical wholesaler. However, when he finished the game and had it published, it became such a smash success that Erikawa converted Koei into a video game studio and set to work on video games full-time. For his future projects, Erikawa took on the pen name Kou Shibusawa. Originally released on the PC-8801 and FM-7 computers in 1983, versions have been produced for the PC, NES, Genesis, Game Boy, SNES, and numerous other platforms.[CR]Nobunaga's Ambition is the first in a long-running series of historical strategy games set against Japan's Warring States era. Its title refers to Nobunaga Oda, one of the most powerful warlords of the era, who was on a path to unifying Japan under his rule until his assassination in 1582. In the game, the player attempts to do what Nobunaga could not, and unite all of Japan.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]As the title suggests, the player is tasked with achieving the ultimate goal of warlord Nobunaga Oda; the conquest and unification of Japan. Selecting Nobunaga Oda is optional, however, as the player is also able to choose from a variety of other regional daimyos of the era.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player may choose from four campaign scenarios including:Battle for the East (beginning in 1560)Daimyo Power Struggles (1560)Ambition Untamed (1571)Road Towards Unification (1582)The territorial map of Japan.[CR]In each scenario, the player must first select a daimyo to play as, and also determine the daimyo's statistics, which are defined by Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm, and IQ. Each statistic is ranked on a hundred-point scale. The progression of time is structured in a turn-based manner. When in the map view, the passing of a turn corresponds to a change in season, and each turn during battle corresponds to the passing of a single day. As time passes, daimyos and officers age and will eventually die of natural causes. As the game progresses, the player must allocate resources to raise a capable military force, encourage a productive economy to support both military and civilian expansion, and support the peasants in order to sustain their respect and loyalty.[CR]Battles take place in maps that are divided into 5x10 grids with terrain types such as hills, mountains, villages, rivers, plains, and castles. The player may achieve victory in battle through numerous means, among which include forcing the enemy to retreat, destroying the enemy command unit, outlasting an invading force, or prolonging battle until the opposing force has exhausted its supplies.[CR]Outside of battle, the player can make numerous decisions that affect domestic and diplomatic policy as well as military decisions that affect troop strength and allocation. Such actions include transporting soldiers, rice and gold between fiefs, which can be used to strengthen regions at the expense of others. Taxes may be raised or lowered to adjust the income level and the land may be cultivated to boost productivity, though raising taxes or choosing to cultivate will also lead to a decrease in loyalty among the peasants. Expanding a town allows for greater tax income, as well, but also leads to a reduction in loyalty. If loyalty drops too low, the peasants may rise up in rebellion.[CR]To ward against floods, the player can adjust the level of flood control, though the higher the control, the lower the productivity. It is also possible to recruit soldiers or ninja for the military, train the troops, and provide rice to the peasants and troops as a means to raise morale. On the diplomatic side, in addition to going to war, it is also possible to encourage good relations between rival factions by ratifying a non-aggression pact or arranging a marriage. Alternatively, the player can also send spies to keep tabs on rivals or work to win over a rival's own peasants. Merchants can be approached in order to buy weapons, buy or sell rice, or borrow money. It is also possible for the player character daimyo to fall ill, and so if necessary, the player may need to spend time to recuperate.[CR]If a player does not wish to control every aspect of governing, it is also possible to allow the computer AI to govern aspects of selected fiefs.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]The Nobunaga's Ambition series has garnered several awards over the years. According to Koei's website, various releases in the series have won Log-In magazine's "BHS Prize", the "Minister of Post &amp; Telecommunications Prize", Nikkei BP's 12th, 13th and 14th annual "Best PC Software" awards, and CD-ROM Fan's "Fan of the Year 2001 Grand Prize".[CR]In North America, where it was released almost five years after its Japanese release, critical reception was also positive. Evan Brooks of Computer Gaming World enjoyed the game greatly, and in the September 1988 issue rated it as "Highly Recommended", with a score of 4/5 stars. He introduced the game as "a detailed economic / diplomatic / political / military simulation of the unification of Japan in the Sixteenth Century." He praised the graphics for being "among the best that this reviewer has ever seen for the IBM" and the 5x10 hex map battles, and noted that it used RPG elements, including assigning various statistics and attributes to a selected persona, a time system where each turn represents a year, as the daimyo ages and eventually dies of old age, and a multiplayer option. In his review, he noted, "This reviewer was glued to his computer for 13 hours, stopping at 3:00 am. Not since Gunship has this occurred. The end result is that the computer gamer must have, at least, one Koei game in his inventory!" Compute! similarly praised the IBM PC version, calling it "one of the best strategic war games ever designed for a personal computer" and citing the game play, user interface, and documentation.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Nolan Ryan's Baseball</title_clean>
				<plot>"On the plus side, it came with a really cool poster"[CR]Growing up, I was always a huge fan of Nolan Ryan. I'm not quite sure why. He never played on a team I followed, and he was near the end of his career by the time I got into Baseball. Yet, for some reason, there was always something about him that fascinated me. So much so that I spent an inordinate amount of money to get his rookie card recently. So much so, that one of the first Super Nintendo games I ever got, I bought for the sole reason that he was on it. Now, why is this important to you? Well, unless you happen to be a huge fan of Nolan Ryan and like to buy things just because his name is on it, this game might not be for you. It isn't all that bad though, it really can be a fun little game once you get into it. Plus, the game did come with a really nifty poster, so, that's something (although, odds are you probably won't get that with the game now. Nonetheless though).[CR]As in many early Baseball games, there was no official licensing from Major League Baseball. So, aside from Nolan Ryan being on the cover, and the "T" team having a player on it named "Ryan," the rest of your roster will be filled with players with names like "Leo" and "Burt," and you'll be playing against teams like the "R" team and the "B" team. Everyone looks the same of course, so, your guess is as good as anyone else as to who these people, places and teams are. That's alright though, you're here to play Baseball, not look at names. It can get a bit confusing at times, but, it's not too big of a deal.[CR]As far as the actual play of the game itself goes, it's fairly straightforward, no-frills Baseball. When you're on the mound, you pitch the ball, push down to make it go faster or up to make it go slower, left or right to make it go to the side. As your pitcher tires, the response of the ball will decrease. When hitting, you simply swing the bat or you don't. The annoying part to hitting is, if you stop midswing, instead of pulling the bat back, the hitter leaves it there, usually resulting in the ball hitting the bat and weakly rolling out to the mound. Aside from this though, pitching and hitting is about as one would imagine. Baserunning and fielding, however, are another story.[CR]The game does have some issues here, in that things happen which shouldn't happen in a normal game of Baseball. Such as, the shortstop's throw taking two bounces on the way to first. Or, a runner moving from first to second on a hit to the outfield being thrown out before he reaches second. Or, the ever-frustrating first baseman who stands rooted to his bag as a ground ball rolls weekly a few inches away from him. So, yes, there are most certainly some little annoyances. For the most part though, it's not a normal game of Baseball.[CR]That isn't to say there isn't anything that makes this game above average. For one, there's a season mode, which saves your record and statistics and whatnot. While it's true that, if you don't enjoy one game you're not going to enjoy a season's worth of them, it's a nice addition to be able to play through a season, working toward a goal, and accumulating stats. Whether you're just trying to get your team to have a good overall record, or trying to have a player excel in certain stats, or make an ace pitcher or whatever, the accumulation of stats can lead to a number of new goals within the game. In addition, there are a number of editing options within the game. While you can't just make a team of super-powered people, since there are rules on how exactly you can distribute stats, you're allowed to edit various statistics of the team's players, making a team that fits your liking. There's also a "Free Agent" pick, although what exactly differentiates one player from another isn't always particularly clear. [CR]These options are quite fun to play around with, and can add a good amount of replay value, as you play through the game with different types of teams.[CR]As far as graphics and sound go, both of them are marked by a general feeling of mediocrity, with a few spurts of impressiveness. The graphics of the field, players on the field, and pretty much everything, for the most part, is nothing better than average. Where they stand out, however, is on highlights and close plays. Sometimes, as your fielder goes to dive for a ball, or there's a close play at a base, the game will zoom in to the play, showing the runner approaching the base as the ball approaches the glove, and you can watch as you see his foot hit the base a second before the pop of the ball into the glove. With music, likewise, the general background music is alright, but nothing special to speak of. However, the game includes voice for a number of things. You'll get to hear the umpire call out "Play Ball!" as well as the calls of strikes and balls, and safe and out at the bases. These touches, while not the most impressive things in the world, are still nice little additions.[CR]So, in the end, what it comes down to is, this is a fairly average game gameplay wise, with some nice little bells and whistles tossed in. If you don't enjoy the simplistic gameplay, you're not going to care in the least about the closeups on plays, or the customization or anything. While the gameplay doesn't really stand out in any respect, in most cases it's not going to cause any major problems where it's going to cause you to be turned off. If you like Baseball games, this does a decent enough job of the basics. Once you get past this, the game does have a number of nice little options to it. The customization options are very good, and can give you some new and interesting ways to play the game. As well, the season play is definitely a very welcome addition, as playing through a season and building stats is very enjoyable, spread out over a few days, a few weeks, or a few months. [CR]It's easy enough to just sit down for a few minutes to play through a game or two, and end up going through much more than that. While there may be better options out there for your SNES Baseball fix (in particular, the Ken Griffey games and Baseball Simulator 1.000, among others), Nolan Ryan's Baseball can still be a nice little addition to your collection. Especially if you're a Nolan Ryan fan.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]: 6/10[CR]Graphics/Sound: 6/10[CR]Length/Replay: 9/10[CR]Overall: 7/10[CR]Reviewer's Score: 7/10, Originally Posted: 12/21/04[CR]Reveiwer: terrisus[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/snes/review/R82814.html[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Nosferatu is a horror-themed action-adventure game based on the legend of Nosferatu (an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula). The player, as Kyle, must recover his girlfriend Erin from the vampire Nosferatu after the undead creature spirits her away in the middle of the night and takes her back to his castle.[CR]The game takes elements from both Konami's Castlevania franchise and Prince of Persia. Kyle moves through the castle using his fists, acrobatics and wits to avoid traps and fight Nosferatu's minions, most of which are classic horror archetypes like Frankenstein's Monster. Like Prince of Persia, the player has a hard time limit to get to Erin and Nosferatu in a far tower, but this time limit can be extended by finding special hourglass power-ups. Kyle can also find crystals that increase his power (red), restore health (green) or increase the length of his health bar (blue).[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Wil Mason has been transported to the fantasy world of Middlemere, which is ruled by four rival brothers. Wils aim is to find the secret to how he was transported here and discover a way back.[CR]The gameplay consists of a combination of arcade elements and first person view much like Eye of the Beholder and Dungeon Master.  One of the more remarkable features is in the first person mode, rather than having just 4 directs to face and flicking between them there are 8 directions and the view scrolls smoothly as you turn. This smooth scrolling continues when you move forward, giving the game more of a 3D feel.[CR]The arcade elements consist of horizontal scrolling areas where you fight enemies with your bow while avoiding their attacks.  Later you encounter a similar type of gameplay that involves exploring castles and adds 4 directional movement.</plot>

				<plot>STORY OF OGRE BATTLE[CR]The days of Zenobia are growing dark and cold -- evil is running rampant over the entire continent. Shadows of men roam the streets, whispering of the demise of their great King. The trusted Sage Rashidi fell prey to the evils of power, and in its grip, Rashidi slew Gran, the mighty King. Rashidi then joined forces with Empress Endora, and their reign of terror spread to the entire continent. Thus the Zetegenian Empire was born.[CR]YOUR MISSION[CR]It's been nearly a quarter of a century since the reign of terror began. The Empire rules with neither justice nor compassion. The last remaining members of the rebellion are gathering on the outskirts of Sharom. The rebellion is greatly outnumbered by the mighty Empire, and there seems no way to defeat such an evil power. However, secrets carried through the wind tell of a great Wizard, "Warren" who may be willing to help you. Choose your path wisely, listen carefully to the people, and gain their confidence. If you are not careful, all will have been in vain. You will have toppled an evil Empire, only to start one of your own.[CR]--From the SNES Ogre Battle: The March of the Black Queen instruction manual.[CR][B]Overview:[/B]:[CR]Raise an army powerful enough to stop the Black Queen![CR]Ogre Battle is, in my opinion, one of the best strategy games released for the SNES. Enix, the same company that brought us the classic Dragon Warrior series, produced it, so its quality can hardly be questioned. This game was very complex, but unlike many other strategy games, the complexity of Ogre Battle is one of its best features. The level of detail makes the game more realistic and enjoyable. Many war games overwhelm the player with tedious details that slow the game and make the experience more excruciating rather than more interesting. Enix managed to avoid this pitfall and produce one truly classic strategy game.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]The game could probably be called an RPG as well as a strategy game. When you start a new game, you create a character by answering a series of questions for the wise man Warren. Depending on your answers you are given a selection of Tarot cards that you will use later in the game.[CR]You start off with a small band of warriors and have to fight on a "proving ground" to show you have what it takes to command an army.[CR]As you move your forces to capture cites and other locations, you will find more Tarot cards and even special items. The Tarot cards have special effects during battles and should only be used at need. You can only keep a limited number, however, so throwing one down once in a while is a good idea. The items you find can be equipped to certain members of your army depending on the item in question and the class of the unit you want to give it to. These items greatly increase that unit's strength and should be utilized as much as possible.[CR]I mention your unit's class because each unit does have a class. In fact, each unit is considered an individual and has not only a class, but also hit points and even stats, along with attacks based on their class. They gain experience in battle and can upgrade to different classes as they gain levels. The units even have an alignment that makes a difference when they fight. Alignment comes into play because the game takes place in real time and has both a day and night cycle. Depending on the party's alignment they may fight better during the day or night. Their attacks are also stronger on the type of terrain they are best suited to. For instance, giant octopus fight best in the water. These subtleties give the game a definite RPG feel.[CR]Even economy is included in the dazzling number of features Ogre Battle has to offer. Again, Enix didn't overload the gamer with details, but added a system that was simple to use and gave the game even more depth. Each day that passes, you collect revenue from towns you currently have control of. You use the money you collect to deploy your units, recruit new units and even buy items at certain towns. It's a simple system, but can make a huge impact on the way you play the game.[CR]The game is actually its own tutorial, so you need almost no instruction to get started. Each town you capture gives you advice on game play and information you will use throughout the game. This makes the game easy to get started on, even though there are an almost dizzying number of options. I have only touched the surface of the game in reality. Ogre Battle is a game that can hardly be explained: it must be experienced, and I suggest you do so. [CR][B]Hints:[/B][CR]Slaying Undead[CR]As in any RPG style game clerics are the bane of undead. If you forget this you will regret it.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Level Passwords:[CR]Enter these as a new character name:[CR]FIRESEAL [CR]Bonus Stage[CR]Fu-small a-i-a-ku-re-su-to [CR]Bonus Stage (Japan Only)[CR]MUSIC/ON [CR]Music Test[CR]Reset the game[CR]Hold Select, Start, L, and R while in the game.[CR]Reviewer: Aaron[CR]http://www.consoleclassix.com/snes/ogre_battle_march_black_queen.html[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter these as a new character name:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Unlock The Endings[CR]These are the conditions to unlock the 13 endings in the game.

				<title_clean>Olympic Summer Games</title_clean>
				<plot>Olympic Summer Games is the 16-bit official videogame of the 1996 Olympic Games held in Atlanta, the third and the last IOC official title to be released on the console. A typical button masher, includes 10 events (100m sprint, 110m hurdles, pole vault, long jump, triple jump, javelin, high jump, discus, skeet and archery) and 32 countries around the world compete in custom or full Olympics, or just practice. Two players can compete head to head in the sprinting events, and a total of eight can play in the same game. Three difficulty levels allow competitive events for both rookies to veterans in the genre.[CR]Sprinting events are a short and straight button mashing frenzy. 4 athletes compete simultaneously, the first winner advancing to the next round (two qualifiers and then the medal run). Only fast fingers and quick shotgun reaction can earn world record times. [CR]Jumping events are a mix of shorter button mashing bursts combined with timely pressed jumps. From the straight forward high and long jump events (run and then set the jump angle) to the more elaborate triple jump (as the name suggests, three jumps must be carefully measured for world class results) and the complex pole vault, where a strong run must be followed by a sharp pole fixation and good a release upwards. Both long jump and triple jump have a first round composed by three jumps, the better eight progress into the second round, where they are given three more jumps. In the high jump and pole vault the competition continues until all athletes miss three consecutive jumps.[CR]The throwing events (discus and javelin) work in the same fashion as the jumping events, although trickier to pull, as the setting of the angle must be followed by a timely release. Each player is entitled to three throws, the top eight allowed three more attempts.[CR]Finally, the shooting events. Archery is a three-round competition where the goal is to amass as many points as possible by shooting at the inner rings of the target. With six arrows per round, each shot must be calculated according to the wind, choosing between steady aim and lower tension (must be aimed upwards and compensating the wind) or higher tension but a jumpy aim (can be aimed directly at the "gold" points). Skeet is a five round competition where the goal is to hit five clay pigeons before they disappear off-screen with two slugs for each.</plot>

				<title_clean>On the Ball</title_clean>
				<plot>There's a kind of knick-knack you may find in dusty games rooms, a maze through which you navigate a marble by subtly tilting the board, dancing with gravity and momentum, deftly rolling your sphere out of dead ends and around the obstacles posed by holes in the board. Marble Madness explores this theme in a fudged 3-D perspective, Cloud Kingdoms in a flat 2-D one -- both by directly influencing the actions of the ball.  The game takes a different approach toward a similar end; instead of moving the ball around the board, you move the board around the ball.[CR]That's right; from the get-go, gravity pulls ever down, down, down on your ball toward the bottom of your screen regardless of board orientation; the task of the player is to rotate the board now clockwise, now counter-clockwise, to further a timely and unobstructed path beneath the ball in its progress toward each level's goal before the timer ticks down to zero.  The game might as well have been named "inertia."  Many obstacles can be avoided, but some must be engaged head-on: a certain momentum, if not terminal velocity, must be achieved to break through crumbling brick barriers; other obstacles toggle on and off like traffic lights, demanding not only speed but timing.  Some influence the ball's direction, and in addition to merely delaying the ball's progress, touching some impediments incurs an additional time penalty -- conversely, some blocks bestow time bonuses, if you can afford the ever-diminishing time needed to take the scenic detour and collect them.[CR]It may seem like a transparent attempt to cobble together a game around a technical demo of the SNES' Mode 7 on-the-fly graphics-rotation capabilities, but Taito actually cooked up this kooky game interface two years earlier for an arcade release of this game.[CR](Now if only someone could explain the "Camel" part - referencing the Japanese title.)</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Operation Europe: Path to Victory 1939-45, or Europa Sensen ("European Front") as it's known in Japan, is a Koei turn-based war strategy game based on conflicts taking place during World War II.[CR]The game is the WW2 equivalent to Koei's earlier Nobunaga's Ambition and Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. As with those games, emphasis is placed on individual commanders and their abilities, and the game prioritizes tactics and numbers over graphical prowess. The player has a number of different WW2 commanders to choose from while playing either side, some of which are real but most are fictional.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The best scientists in the world have been working for years on the Subspace Particle Transfer Project, a process that uses subspace transporters to dematerialize an object, then instantly rematerializes it at another location. Short distance transfers of individuals have also been successful, and the scientists were about to begin long-range transport experiments.However, contactwith the research laboratory has been lost. Someone - or something - has taken over the facility and shut down all outside communications. There is no information about the intruders or their capabilities... no one has entered the facility and returned to tell about it. Plans for a final assault have been prepared and if it fails, there will be no choice but to destroy the entire installation. Agent Logan, who has been fitted with bioelectronic implants that give him superior strength, reflexes, and anlystical abilities, has been briefed on all aspects of the mission. Now it's up to him to infiltrate the lab, neutralize the intruders, and rescure the scientists.</plot>

				<title_clean>Operation Thunderbolt</title_clean>
				<plot>Operation Thunderbolt is the exciting sequel to Operation Wolf. An airliner is hijacked by terrorists en-route from Paris to Boston, who threaten to kill all hostages on board if their mates aren't released from jail. Instead of reaching its destination, the airliner makes a landing in Kalubya, Africa, and all the hostages are hidden in various locations. The authorities have asked the hero from Operation Wolf to rescue the hostages, but only this time, the hero brings his friend along for the ride.[CR]There are eight missions to complete in Operation Thunderbolt, and each one has you shooting down soldiers, choppers, and tanks. The gameplay varies every one or two missions. In some missions, you are driving a jeep or controlling a boat, while in others, you are walking while you're shooting. You have a limited supply of ammo, and a limited supply of rocket bombs, but you can always stock up by shooting down crates falling from the sky, or by killing a cat or dog that get in the line of fire. Also from crates, you can get special items like bulletproof vests, rocket bombs, and different weapons.[CR]You also have a life bar to worry about. If you're shot at by soldiers, or if rocket bombs or grenades are thrown at you, you 'll lose energy, and once you're energy is depleted,  you lose one of your three lives. You can lose a lot of energy by killing hostages on purpose,  and you can't easily avoid killing them if you decide to use rocket bombs to wipe out enemies. The eighth mission, the mission that involves you fighting terrorists on a plane,  proves to be difficult because a woman in a blue dress stands up and gets in the line of fire, and you have to very careful when you're going to use rocket bombs.[CR]There are two endings to this game, and which ending you can watch will depend on the number of hostages you've saved, and whether or not you shot the pilot instead of the mission eight boss.</plot>

				<title_clean>Out of this World</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Lester's Lab.[CR]The player takes on the role of  Lester Knight Chaykin, a young physicist who  accidentally manages to destroy his lab and gets himself somehow  teleported onto another world. After a quick exploration of the local area, he is quickly captured by the sentient inhabitants of the planet, a race of bulky, humanoid creatures. Lester then wakes up in a cage with another one of the creatures, looking over what appears to be a mining complex.[CR]He quickly escapes, eliminating his guard and freeing his companion who proceeds to help Lester leave the complex and get to the surface. It is immediately apparent that the alien race was using their own as slaves, and that they operated as a Roman-esque society, albeit with lasers, complete with a Colosseum and a harem. Lester is eventually caught and nearly killed by one of the creatures, but he manages to defeat his attacker and is saved by the very companion he freed at the start. Lester and his companion then ride an enormous bird-like creature off into the distance.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The laser in use.[CR]Out of This World uses 2D  side-scrolling mechanics, similar to most platformers released at the time. As such, the player could move both left and right, run, jump, crouch, and at some points use a  laser gun. The gun allows the player to both create charged shots and shields. Because Lester can only survive one hit before dying, and in early parts of the game it is entirely possible for the gun to run out of ammo, precision and care are needed when attacking enemies. Although inefficient, the game includes a password system, which affords the player the ability to continue on from previous  checkpoint.[CR]There are many points where the player must solve complex  puzzles in order to proceed, often involving trial and error. Notable is the  lack of a HUD; there is no  score, no lives system, no map, no  ammunition count, no  inventory.[CR]The Game-world[CR]As there are no explanatory  cutscenes or dialogue, players must figure out for themselves what the nature of the place is, and its true location. There is a clue toward the end which suggests that the world where the player character was transported to may not be what it first appears, although that interpretation is left up to the player.[CR]From the outset, the region of the world where the game takes place seems to be arid and largely desolate. Animals and plants tend to be brutal and predatory, and the sentient life forms conduct gladiatorial games and what appears to be forced labor, as noted earlier. These traits may be evident of a Roman Empire level of culture in terms of art and architecture, although the architecture may be more comparable to medieval Muslim architecture in the  middle-east. Although their culture may be primitive by human standards, their technology is certainly not. They possess a greater understanding of energy and how to harness it, evident in  power nodes which are dotted around the city, but also in their weaponry, which can  stun on the lowest setting and is otherwise lethal. They also possess flying vehicles that supersede technologically anything humanity has built so far.[CR]Original Production[CR]Rotoscoping models used by Eric Chahi.[CR]Animation of the principle characters was performed through a process called  rotoscoping, whereby real objects were used as models for animation work, lending a life-like and quirky feel to the movement that might seem flat and predictable if animated through simple physics models. Allegedly, Lester's appearance is based on  Eric Chahi. However, because Chahi found it disturbing to see himself in the game, he decided to change Lester to a Redhead.[CR]The game was originally, officially released for  PC (DOS),  Amiga,  Atari,  Macintosh,  3DO,  SNES,  Genesis and the Sega CD. The Atari and Amiga versions were developed first. They are relatively shorter compared to later versions, and have a higher  difficulty level due to more precise timing required of the player. The PC version was the first to introduce a whole new level in the middle to latter third of the game to help lengthen the game and strengthen the narrative.[CR]Further obstacles were added for the Genesis and SNES console ports, as  Interplay purportedly wanted players to get as much gameplay as possible for their dollar.  Nintendo also had demands about certain scenes which were considered to be inappropriate for minors (which amounted to a few pixels worth of deletions during a bathhouse scene; as well as changing reddish ichor, which might be interpreted as blood, to green).[CR]The Sega CD version of the game included a game set in the same world, dubbed  Out of this World 2: Heart of the Alien, which took place from the point of view of the aliens. Eric Chahi has stated, however, that this in-house Interplay project suffers in terms of animation quality and its value as a game, as he was not involved in the project.[CR]Eric Chahi has stated that the problem with some of the early enhanced versions was that the backgrounds were a lot easier to improve than the characters themselves. In order to enhance the characters, new rotoscoping or detailed, frame-by-frame enhancement of the animations would have to be done, while the backdrops could be repainted with relative ease. Doing the latter without the former, though, would result in the characters in the foreground looking flat. For the 3DO version, Chahi says, this is especially apparent.[CR]The enhancement of the animations themselves could probably not be done because processors of the time could not handle so many frames of animation being very detailed, although currently such restrictions are negligible.[CR]In addition to the listed versions, there were also unofficial ports to both the  GBA and GP32 systems.[CR]Sequel[CR]Though fans have been hoping for a true sequel, Chahi has stated that he wishes for the game to have no continuation as he wants the ending of the original to remain ambiguous and fans could make their own conclusion to the franchise.[CR]"I think the story is complete. It has a lot of mystery, so doing a sequel would be very tricky. It could break the magic it has."[CR]- Eric Chahi[CR](Retro Gamer issue #96, 2011)[CR]Despite this, a sequel was made for the Sega CD in 1994 called  Heart of The Alien, which placed Buddy as the main protagonist. Chahi was not involved with the development and dismissed the "sequel" to be non-canon.[CR]Availability[CR]The original game is not easy to find, but a new, high resolution version is available as a demo, or a full version for 7 Euros (at the time of this writing) from the creator Eric Chahi on  his website. The new version has more detailed backgrounds, multiple graphics modes, more save points and Windows XP and Vista compatible.[CR]Telco Games also distributes a mobile phone version of the game.15th Anniversary Edition[CR]The 15th Anniversary Edition is also available from GOG.com and comes with a selection of extra content, including:manual (17 pages)2 HD wallpapersdevelopment diarytechnical handbooksoundtrack"making of" video20th Anniversary Edition[CR]In 2011, in commemoration of its 20th anniversary, Out of This World was made available for the iOS (iPhone and iPad) and later Android. The game also arrived on Steam for the first time in 2013. These versions were created by DotEmu and distributed by Bulky Pix.[CR]Included are:The ability to switch to the original and HD graphics at any timeNew intuitive touch controls3 difficulty modes - Normal (easier than original game), Difficult (equal to original game) and Very Hard (more difficult than original game)100% remastered sounds and FXGame Center support with 13 achievements5 languages support (English, French, Italian, German, Spanish)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Skipping[CR]You hold the run button and hold the jump button at the same time, Lester will do this goofy little jump-run that looks like he's skipping like a kindergarden student. This is actually a little faster than just running, so this is helpful if you're stuck at the part when running from the beast in the first stage. But doing this, for some reason, makes you more likely to get hit by laser fire from the enemy.</plot>

The player ought to be wary of Le Chef Noir, Pierre's archrival, who will periodically open the cage doors and let the captured food items out.[CR]Food items will run from Pierre if they spot him. If the player is quick enough, they can be captured while their back is turned. If they start running, Pierre can quickly catch up and capture them. They can also be stunned by jumping on their head and captured safely. A certain amount of points can be earned depending on how efficiently a food item is captured. If a food item collides with Pierre, Pierre is briefly stunned and lets two of the food items he's carrying loose. Depositing food item regularly gets around this problem, but they can still be released by Noir.[CR]In order to catch anything, Pierre needs to find the net on each stage. There's also a smattering of other items lying around:Power-UpsNet: Pierre's net. He needs this before he can catch anything.Wooden Spoon: A close range weapon, useful for beating Noir when there's no room to jump.Hot Sauce: A weapon that attacks enemies at medium range, with a plume of flame.Flour Bag: A weapon that works best at range.Cleats: Special shoes that prevent sliding on ice.Golden Apron: Temporary invincibility.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Mindscape developed this game hoping to get it licensed as an official Mad Max game, however Warner Bros never made this happen. Anyway, the game closely resembles "The Road Warrior" (Mad Max 2). Your objective is to drive your car through the wasteland, trying to survive motorcycle gang members' attacks and to avoid running out of gas.[CR]The gameplay is a split of two genres: racing and side-scrolling. In the racing parts you have to destroy enemies like motorcycle gang members, gyro-copter captains, red trucks, etc. Your car has a machine-gun installed in its front, and if some guy drives along side of you, a little window pops up, allowing you to shoot them with your shotgun.[CR]Along the road there are several towns, and every time you pass through one of them, an alarm will warn you. As your gas run low, you have to stop on these towns and refuel your reserves of gas and ammo. When doing so, the game turns to a side-scrolling perspective, as you get out of your car, dealing with your enemies in hand-to-hand combats. In the cities you'll also find new equipment to your car, such as missile launchers, nitro, etc.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Last password[CR]Press Select at the title screen to access the password screen and enter the following password to be 5 towns away from the last boss:[CR]2M(heart)F(heart)JCLK66CBKP[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Last password[CR]Enter the password on the name entry screen for a new high score.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]PTO: Pacific Theater of Operations, or Teitoku no Ketsudan, is a very in-depth strategy game in which the player takes control of the US Allied forces or Japanese Axis forces during naval battles set across the Pacific Ocean. As well as directing the various ships in the player's fleet during battles, the player is also responsible for maintaining their fleet, their supply lines and their good relations with allies and potential allies.[CR]PTO: Pacific Theater of Operations was followed up with a sequel, PTO 2. Although the third game (Teitoku no Ketsudan III) did not receive a localization, the fourth game (PTO IV) was released in the US and Europe for the PS2.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Pac-Attack</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pac-Attack is a  Pac-Man spin-off, in the same vein as  Tetris and/or  Dr Mario. It is based somewhat on Namco's earlier game Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle, an Arcade and Super Famicom game released the previous year.[CR]Pac-Attack has been released on many different systems. The original version was released on the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis in late 1993, closely followed by the Game Boy and Game Gear versions. An enhanced port was released on the Philips CD-i with the name Pac-Panic. It has also been released in many Namco and Pac-Man compilations, and the SNES version was rereleased on the Wii's Virtual Console.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Pac-Attack Screen[CR]The object of the game is to clear rows of blocks by getting them into straight lines; however, most of the falling puzzle pieces also have ghosts attached which take up valuable space where blocks could be stored. The solution to this problem is Pac-Man himself. Every once in a while a Pac-Man piece will fall, and all the ghosts on the board will turn blue. If the Pac-Man piece is situated in an area where he can easily catch any ghosts he will remove them from the grid.[CR]The game offers a standard "Normal Mode" in which the game plays out as described above, as well as a "Puzzle" mode in which the player is given a limited number of Pac-Man to eat the various ghosts.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 8,7,7,8 and 8 out of ten. Mike Weigand wrote, "No, don't laugh, just try it! This game looks like nothing but once you start playing you will not be able to stop! The three games are addictive, and the two-player competition will have you and a friend playing until you drop!".[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Pac-In-Time</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pac-in-Time is a platformer game for the Super Nintendo, Game Boy and PC featuring Namco's spherical ghost-eating hero. It is a re-branded version of 1993's  Fury of the Furries which didn't feature Pac-Man, but four different furry, ball-like creatures, called Tinies. The developer of Fury of the Furries, French company Atreid Concept (later Kalisto Entertainment), was also the developer of Pac-in-Time.[CR]Frustrated at Pac-Man's repeated victories over her spectral minions, the Ghost Witch warps Pac-Man through time to prevent him from interfering with her plans. Pac-Man has to make his way back through a series of worlds to stop her from taking over.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Pac-Man can only complete a stage after collecting all the pellets on the level. To reach them, he has to find some or all of the power-ups: each increases his ability to move around the level or unlocks more of it to explore. These include:Rope: The rope lets Pac-Man swing across any ceiling, but Pac-Man has to be within a certain range for the rope to attach. It cannot be used horizontally: only vertically.Fireball: Pac's best weapon against the non-ghost enemies. Without it, Pac-Man won't be able to get around enemies without getting hurt, and he can only take so many hits before losing a life.Hammer: The hammer allows Pac-Man to break through certain barriers and open chests.Bubble: The bubble allows Pac-Man to swim through underwater sections, collecting whatever is under the surface. Without it, Pac-Man simply bobs on top of any body of water.[CR]In addition, Pac-Man also has to find a way to eliminate ghosts on the stage, as they will continue to hound him until he has been defeated. Ghosts can be eaten whenever Pac-Man finds a Power Pellet, but these are rare and Pac-Man must chase down the now fleeing ghosts before its effects wear off.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Stage Select[CR]First enter ''LVDYK,'' as your password.

				<title_clean>Pac-Man 2 - The New Adventures</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures is a puzzle/adventure game spinoff of the Pac-Man series. It takes elements from Pac-Land, the Pac-Man themed side-scrolling platformer that is thought to be one of the earliest examples of the genre, as well as elements from the official TV show such as Pac-Man's family.[CR]The game was released for both the Super Nintendo and Genesis in 1994. In Japan, the game is known as "Hello! Pac-Man", due to how the player has to communicate directions to Pac-Man to solve puzzles.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player is equipped with a sling shot and can shoot at points of interest to bring them to Pac-Man's attention. The player may also tell Pac-Man which way he should go. Pac-Man, however, has a mind of his own and will grow increasingly frustrated if the player leads him into harm's way too many times, and he might just completely ignore the player if he gets too angry. The game also contains super pellets which can be given to Pac-Man at any point to have him transform into Super Pac-Man. In fact, when the ghosts appear throughout random points in the game, Pac-Man is left in paralyzing fear. If the player has run out of super pallets before eliminating all the ghosts, Pac-Man faints.[CR]In the first stage of the game, Pac-Man is tasked with stopping by the farm and picking up milk for Baby Pac. The next section of the game leads Pac-Man to the mountains in search of a flower for Lucy. This section also contains a hand-gliding section in which the player guides Pac-Man in the proper direction. In the third section, Pac-Man must retrive Pac Jr.'s stolen guitar which leads Pac-Man to the city and eventually to a mine cart section that controls much like the hand gliding section. The final stage begins with a broadcast of the ghosts stealing all the ABC gum in the city followed by a message from the Ghost Witch of Netor who goes onto warn Pac-Man of her near completed Gum Monster. Pac-Man must search for the abandoned factory which houses the Gum-Monster and turn into Super Pac-Man to defeat it and all the ghosts.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Pagemaster is a 1994 action-platformer game based on the movie of the same name. It was released on the Sega Genesis, SNES and PC.[CR]The player assumes the role of Richard (played by Macaulay Culkin in the movie), who must make his way through three worlds each consisting several levels and each based on a different literary genre. (Horror, Adventure and Fantasy.) Along with several collectibles completionists can also find a library card in each level. The player will lose whatever magical item they are holding if they are hit; this acts as a bonus hit, similar to the rings in Sonic the Hedgehog.[CR]The PC version of the game is completely different: it is an point and click adventure game that has a plot unrelated to that of the movie.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Select[CR]Press B, A, X, Select and Start while playing the game to select any level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Select[CR]At the title screen, press B, A, L , Down, Y , B , A, L , Down , Y.

				<title_clean>Paladin's Quest</title_clean>
				<plot>The world of Lennus is a world of legends and wonders and is divided into two continents; Naskuot, the northern continent and Saskuot, the southern continent. Thirteen years ago a strange disaster befell this world and killed many people. Upon the ruins of a great city and sealing back a great evil, a school of magic was built. Young Chezni is a student of that school of magic, striving to become a great spiritualist and control the elements. Meanwhile, a dictator to the south, Zaygos has conquered the entire continent and seeks to conquer the other half of the world. One day, after class Chezni is dared by a fellow classmate to enter and explore the forbidden tower that sits outside the school of magic. Entering the tower, Chezni will soon learn of the machine, Dal Gren that has been sleeping there for 10,000 years. What consequences will his actions have?[CR]Paladin's Quest is a 1-player RPG where the player moves around the world and in locations using an overhead view with up to four members in the party. Randomly encountered monsters engage in a first-person view battle mode that is played using turn-based commands to each player. Along with weapons, magic is available and uses the character's own hitpoints to command. There is no healing magic and no healing items, rather some characters have "bottles", one type of which can restore HP and these can be filled (nine uses per bottle) at most towns. Each character has a different profieciency in one of eight different elements, which may be combined to produce additional spells. New element usage can sometimes be learned by main characters in temples.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Debug Menu[CR]At the start of the game, when asked to enter the hero's name, use any name starting with a lowercase "e".  This causes the debug menu to become available. (This can delete saved games)</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Paperboy 2 is the follow up to Atari's minor Arcade hit Paperboy and features identical gameplay. The goal is to deliver papers to all the houses specified by the player's route, while occasionally scoring bonuses by "shooting" excess papers at various targets along the way. The player must also avoid all the obstacles along the street, which range from traffic to dogs to RC cars to the Grim Reaper. The game was developed specifically for early 1990s computers and consoles; unlike the first, it never began life as an Arcade game.[CR]Unlike the original Paperboy, Paperboy 2 also features a girl who delivers papers. The player must also deliver papers to houses on either side of the street, whereas in the first the player simply had the one side to consider. Achieving certain objectives during the run, like foiling a criminal mid-robbery, will put the Paperboy on the front page of the newspaper that appears at the end of the stage.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released in Japan as Rushing Beat Shura (&#12521;&#12483;&#12471;&#12531;&#12464;&#12539;&#12499;&#12540;&#12488; &#20462;&#32645;), The Peace Keepers is the third title in the Rushing Beat series of brawlers, following Rival Turf! and Brawl Brothers. Like its previous US localizations, the story is rewritten and unrelated from those of the previous games. It was released in Japan on the 17th of December 1993 and later in the US in March 1994.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game plays a lot like contemporary brawlers such as Final Fight. The player can move horizontally and vertically along a two-dimensional field where they have to fight off waves of enemies with kicks, punches, throws and life bar consuming special attacks. The game features several branching paths with their own stages, cut scenes and boss fights as well as multiple endings. The game features six playable characters and allows for co-op play with up to four players using the SNES multitap accessory. A two player versus mode is also available in the game, allowing players to fight each other with the game's selectable characters.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]After the damage caused by the economic wars of 2011 left the world in turmoil, the Deutchland Moldavia Corporation led by a man named Trip Iago rose to power and acquired most of the world's land and resources. By 2015, they have nearly conquered the entire world. With their power unchecked, the DM corporation sets out to fuse their bio-genetic and nanotechnology research to create a super being to further the vision of their corrupt leader. It's now up to four people affected by the ill deeds of the DM Corporation and its genetic experiments to seek revenge on the corporation for its crimes against humanity.[CR]			[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret Character[CR]If you go up to the door at the end of the first stage without going in, then return to the beginning, you will find a secret character: Douglas Bild / Oozie Nelson from an earlier Jaleco title, "Rushing Beat" (the other character, Rick Norton / Jack Flack, is playable in this game). Douglas will apologize for not being able to help fight the Deutchland Moldavia (DM) corporation.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret Character[CR]If you go up to the door at the end of the Roy D Tutto Hospital stage without going in, then return to the manhole you passed in the street, you will find it is open. It is a shorcut to the Stalag 17 stage[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret Character[CR]If you play as Prokop up to the Ozymandias stage, then play as any other character on that stage, Prokop will be killed when you go down the flight of stairs.</plot>

				<title_clean>PGA European Tour</title_clean>
				<plot>European Tour is best thought of as a remake of the original game, rather than a sequel as such. It features 5 courses from across Europe, and 60 top European pros, rather than the US-leaned lineup of the original. The graphics are much more detailed and colorful, as you'd expect considering the intervening years of advances in programming skill.[CR]The control system is the standard three-click method used in most golf games, but you can now define intended draw/fade levels in advance of playing the shot, so that a perfect aim leads to a measured effect, and an imperfect one exaggerating the effect.[CR]As well as the Stroke Play games of the original (where you count the total score across the whole round of 18 holes, and compare this to your opponent), there are also Match Play (where the aim is to win as many individual holes as possible) and Skins (the same, but with money) modes as well.</plot>

				<title_clean>PGA Tour 96</title_clean>
				<plot>PGA Tour 96 was the last of the series released for Sega's 16-bit console, and technologically the most advanced one. Instead of offering  several generic courses, the three available (Spyglass Hill, Sawgrass and River Highlands) are in 3D, with height differences visible (as well as the limited 3D abilities of the console allow).[CR]The player can either chose to play as one of the 10 PGA Pros (whose swings were digitized), or go Pro - the game keeps track of statistics (longest drive, driving accuracy, best round, etc), a game (Tournament, Strokeplay, Skins, Match and Shootout), as well as a replay.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]wise, PGA 96 uses the tried-and-proved triple click system - one to start the swing, other to set strength and a final one for accuracy. It's possible to fade or draw the ball (to bend the trajectory), add backspin and pitch or chip the ball (for some medium range attempts at the hole or go above a bush).The difficulty level affects mostly the leniency of the triple click hit areas - while at novice it is possible to let the accuracy a bit off-center, in pro levels the ball goes where your swing took it - no excuses taken. However, only in Pro it is possible to make the longest drives, as the amateur and novice levels take a few yards from the total capacity of the club.</plot>

				<plot>PGA Tour Golf introduced many of the conventions commonly seen in the genre since. The three-click control method (the first to start the swing, the second setting power and over-swing, the third setting draw or fade) allowed for a multitude of different shots, and required a sense of timing. [CR]Four courses are included, one of them a fantasy 'links' course designed by the programmers. Some of the holes are fiendish, with bunkers, water hazards and trees, and the need to plan strategies to get the best approach to the green.[CR]When playing a tournament there are 60 opponents, each representing top US golfers - ten of these appear with tactical advice for each hole.</plot>

				<title_clean>Phalanx</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Phalanx is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up from Kemco. Its full title, as shown in the title screen of every version, is Phalanx: The Enforce Fighter A-144. A fairly standard example of the genre, the game is best known for its unusual North American SNES box art which depicts an elderly banjo player with the spaceship far in the background.[CR]The game was originally released on the Japanese home computer the Sharp X68000 in 1991, this version was developed by Zoom Inc. It was followed by the SNES version the following year, which was released in the US, Japan and Europe. The 2001 GBA version was also released in those three territories. A WiiWare remake was added to the digital store in 2009 in Japan.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The first stage in the game. The background is comprised of seven layers of parallax scrolling.[CR]Phalanx is a side-scrolling space shooter. The ship which the player controls has the ability to switch between three different movement speeds, allowing for greater dexterity when avoiding enemy threats. Also unlike most space-shooters, the player's ship can take up to three hit points worth of damage, and an item existed which would restore this health. There are three different difficulty levels available at the start, a fourth can be accessed by entering a cheat code.[CR]The player's ship has three slots for weapons, which can be switched between at will. When the player grabs a fourth weapon, the one which they are currently equipped with will be switched out with it. Dropping a weapon will create a "smart bomb" effect which differs depending on the weapon which was dropped.[CR]Box Art[CR]The Game Boy Advance version features more representative cover art.[CR]The gameplay of this title has been significantly overshadowed by its SNES box art, which, instead of depicting a space ship fighting, features an old man playing a banjo with a spaceship zooming past in the background. The words "The Hyper-Speed Shoot-Out In Space" are displayed to the right of the man.[CR]The publisher has stated that the decision was made due to wanting to do something different.[CR]The box art for other platforms omitted the banjo-playing man and focused on the player's spaceship.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra Lives and Continues[CR]At the Execute Mission, press the R buttons, then enter "System Configuration." Press L and R Simultaneously on controller 2 and will able to change the number of credits and live that you have in reserve when start the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra Lives and Continues[CR]At the Execute Mission, press the R button, then enter "System Configuration." Hold R and press B on controller 1 and enter the System Configuration option, then simultaneously press the L and R buttons on controller 2. Now press A+B+X+Y simultaneously on controller 2 and stage select will appear.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra Lives and Continues[CR]After unlocking the 3 Special Environments (Lives, Continues, and Stage Select), Press Start and Select on Controller 2. This allows you to have more lives (up to 30), more continues (up to 99), and select any stage (instead of just the first 5).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret Area[CR]On Level 2 the Underwater Area, when you see a red box on either the top or bottow screen, enter it and you will go into a secret area. Their are two secret Areas in the Underwater Area. The first one's on the top. And the second one's on the bottom. [CR]1st- When you have to move and either destroy or dodge the poles that come at you, at the last one, where it stays and you have to be careful not to get hurt because it's a thick area and you have to move slowly, go up to the top and quickly into the [B] red box [/B] . [CR]2nd- After you go pass the revolving circle of bones that don't connect together, go through it. To know which one it is, its the one where inside the circle of bones have a P power up there. After that, look towards the bottom of the screen and look out for it.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret Area[CR]In the last stage- Final Mission, there are 2 secret areas in this place. The secret place looks like a yellow circle with some gadgets around it. [CR]1st- When you have to slowly go through a series of bars, make sure you just don't take damage or if you do, just quickly cross it to the top to the [B] Yellow circle [/B]. [CR]2nd- Can't excactly remember but its after the sub-boss you have to fight. The sub-boss is thi wierd looking ship where it spits a gravity whole in nowhere between the middle of the screen and then his two projectile users try to slam into you. I just know this one's on the bottom and its right before you go to these wierd monsters where they look like cubes and some digusting cube worms that drip acid water, which damages you so just dodge it.</plot>

				<title_clean>Phantom 2040</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Phantom[CR]Phantom 2040 is a side-scrolling action game released for the SNES and Sega Genesis. The game was developed by Hearst Entertainment and published by Viacom New Media. Phantom 2040 was released in 1995 in Japan, North America, and Europe. The game is based off of the television series of the same name (itself a spinoff of Lee Falk's classic comic series The Phantom), with a story that is similar to that of the television show's, but not directly taken from it. Phantom 2040 is an action game that takes place in the city of Metropia. The Super Nintendo version holds an average rating of 68% on Game Rankings, while there are no reviews registered for the Genesis version.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Phantom 2040 shares similarities with games such as Super Metroid.[CR]The gameplay of Phantom 2040 is similar to many other 2D side-scrolling action games. It contains many aspects similar to such games as Super Metroid and Bionic Commando. However, Phantom 2040 does have entirely unique gameplay mechanics as well. Phantom 2040 differs one way in that upgrading weapons is completely optional (unlike in Super Metroid, where there are set weapons and upgrades). Phantom 2040 also contains choices akin to moral choices (although based more on which direction to go).[CR]Phantom 2040 also focuses heavily on exploration (a key factor in Super Metroid). The player does not have to go a set way, for a set distance as in some games, but rather has each level to explore either direction, locating the objective. Most areas contain secret upgrades or health boosting items. Some levels even have gates that must be remotely unlocked via a corresponding number (each door has a number). Unlike in Super Metroid, most of the exploration is optional, as it veers off of the game's main objective. Most of the areas can be revisited later for more exploration.[CR]The game takes place across seven chapters, some of which are split into varying paths (of which the player has a choice). Each chapter takes the player to a completely new location. Depending on what decisions the player makes in the stages that a decision is available, some stages might not become available while others do. This means that the game has very many endings (over twenty unique endings). Some of these endings, however, aren't considered "winning" endings, and rather prompt the player to try again.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Rebbeca Madison is trying to take over the world; it's up to Phantom to stop her.[CR]It is the year 2040. The world is in a catastrophic state, due to environmental disasters. The Earth's ecological state hangs in the balance. Growing population and the deployment of robots called BIOTS (Biological Optical Transputer Systems) have caused the majority of people to scavenge for food, while the lucky few live in large, towering mansions.[CR]New York City has been renamed Metropia, and is the world's largest and most powerful city. Metropia houses the world's most powerful organization: Maximum, inc.. In addition to being the producer of BIOTS, Maximum holds high political standing due to their bribery of many leaders. Due to this influence, Maximum has transformed Metropia into a technologically-advanced city devoid of any animal or plant life. The insane leader of Maximum, Rebecca Madison, is intent on building a fortress called Cyberville where the wealthy can reside, safe from everything.[CR]Kit Walker is a Phantom (the 24th Phantom, in fact). The Phantoms work to restore order to the world, bringing an end to corruption, greed, and the violence that plagues the world. Kit Walker must now defeat Rebecca Madison to stop her from getting her ultimate goal of world domination.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Passwords[CR]Note: Each line of the password is divided by a forward slash mark (/).</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pieces (JP: Jigsaw Party) is a 1994 puzzle game from Prism Kikaku that was released in Japan by Hori Electric Co. and in the US by Atlus. The player fills in jigsaw puzzles, using their memory of a quick glimpse of the completed picture and a set of five pieces selected randomly from those yet to be added to the puzzle. Each puzzle is created in a way where many of the empty spaces are identical, which means the player has to resort to memory when placing pieces rather than intuit their correct location from the shape of the piece.[CR]The game features a single-player mode, in which the player challenges themselves to complete puzzles on a timer, with the option to add "fake" pieces that don't belong to the puzzle. They can also compete against a second player, or computer opponents of three difficulty tiers (Rice Bowl Crab for Easy, Delinquent Boar for Medium and the Sea Queen for Hard). The multiplayer has power-ups that become unlocked as the player fits more pieces which can help them or hinder their opponent.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Stealing Pieces[CR]To see the art gallery (in Jigsaw Party), press B, X, Y, A on the HORI logo in that exact order. If done correctly, the background will turn yellow and you will be taken to a screen where you can see the puzzles in the game by genre and number. You must reset in order to play the game normally.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pilotwings is a game in which players take on a variety of flight-based challenges, with the ultimate aim of progressing through a series of 'licenses' and ultimately unlocking new activities and events. It was released on the Super Nintendo platform in 1990 in Japan, subsequently coming to the US in 1991, and was both developed and published by Nintendo.Results Screen[CR]In Pilotwings, players were placed under the care of various 'instructors' who governed each set of license activities. Players had to gather sufficient points in each of the activities under a given license and instructor in order to progress to the next level of license. Instructor reactions at the end of each event would change dependent on how well the player had done.[CR]Some of the activities players could undertake included:SkydivingLanding/Flying a BiPlaneRocketbeltHang Gliding[CR]In addition to the main modes, the game also had a number of hidden bonus stages. If a player were to land on special moving targets in the main levels, they would receive a perfect score and be brought into the bonus stages. Landing on the moving target was exceedingly difficult, mostly because of the perspective and the controls. The bonus stages were mostly jokes involving either a penguin plummeting into a pool of water or a person in a giant bird suit. When completed, the score from the bonus round got added to the qualifying score making certification much easier.Rocketbelt Event[CR]The game made extensive use of the SNES's Mode 7 graphics mode, similar to other titles such as Super Mario Kart. The player point was rotated upon flat background surfaces or ground textures in order to give the impression of movement, while keeping the actual player avatar as a static element in the environment. At the time of release, these effects were hailed as giving a realistic feeling of flight due to the level of scaling and rotation made possible by Mode 7. Nintendo Power rated the game at 3.8 out of 5 when they reviewed it in their October Issue of 1991, and the game remains a cult classic for many people, especially in the territories of Europe.[CR]Launch Game[CR]Pilotwings was a North American launch game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES or "Super Nintendo") on November 21st, 1990. The game launched alongside two other SNES launch titles that included:Super Mario WorldF-Zero[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Pink Goes to Hollywood</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pink Goes to Hollywood is a licensed platformer from Manley and Associates, which was published in Europe and the US by TecMagic and in Japan by Altron (where it was simply known as Pink Panther). The game follows the Pink Panther's adventures across numerous film sets in Hollywood, trying to find fame and fortune while eluding the tenacious Inspector Clouseau.[CR]The game was released on both the SNES and Genesis in late 1993. [CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Genesis version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 7,7,7 and 7 out of ten. Danyon Carpenter wrote, "I was surprised by how good this game actually was. Although the character may not be the most modern around, Pink Panther still offers fans of side-scrolling action games some new surprises and a lot of technique. The idea of having movie sets for stages was cool and the music that goes with it is fitting. I would like to have seen more power-ups available, but as it stands, the game is decent".[CR]In the same issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly Mike Weigand reviewed the SNES version of the game giving it a 6 out of ten. He wrote, "The cool pink cat makes it to the home systems! However, you may be better off with the Genesis version of this one, because the SNES counterpart suffers from stiff control and unappealing levels".[CR]Curiously, as a part of the "Major Mike's Game Roundup" the review crew gave additional scores to the scores they had already given the Genesis version. Those scores are, 7,7,5 and 6 out of ten.[CR]				[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Float in air[CR]Plug in a second controller. Then press B. You will notice Pink flying.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Float in air[CR]Not a useful game play trick, but it's fun to play around with.  During gameplay, have a second controller plugged into the game console.  Anytime during play, press and hold the R button on the second controller.  The game will almost look as if it was paused, but if you watch long enough you'll notice it's just in super slow motion.</plot>

				<title_clean>Pirates of Dark Water, The</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pirates of Dark Water is a 2D game developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis by Sunsoft. While the Genesis game is a traditional side-scroller with light combat, the SNES version is more of a brawler in the style of Final Fight and Streets of Rage. The game features the main crew of the 1990s TV show - Ren, Ioz, and Tula - searching for the Treasures of Rule in order to rid the world of Mer of the Dark Water and return Mer and Ren's homeland, Octopon, to its former glory.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Taken from the game's intro:[CR]"On the distant and watery world of Mer, the dying King Primus escapes[CR]from the evil pirate-lord, Bloth, to reveal to Ren his past and his[CR]destiny. Ren, the son of King Primus, must save the planet Mer and[CR]his home, Octopon, from the deadly Dark Water.[CR]"By collecting all the Treasures of Rule, Ren can control the Dark[CR]Water and return Mer and Octopon to their former glory.[CR]"Ren and his crew, Ioz, the hardened ex-pirate and Tula, the[CR]adventure-seeking heroine must embark on a journey that will constantly[CR]test Ren and his crew's strength and dedication toward the quest for[CR]the Treaures of Rule. The evil pirate-lord Bloth and his army of[CR]ruthless pirates also seek the Treasures of Rule.[CR]"Bloth and his ship, the Maelstrom, are always one step behind Ren.[CR]If Bloth can collect the treasures before Ren and his ragtag crew, the[CR]planet Mer is doomed to the Dark Water and Bloth's tyranny forever."[CR]Setting[CR]Pirates of Dark Water is remarkable for its eccentric setting, utilizing the source material's melding of swashbuckling adventures, sword-and-sorcery fantasy, and Road Warrior-inspired fashion aesthetics. Drawing from the cartoon's backstory, players fight rival pirates as well as fantastic creatures sent to hinder the heroes from finding the Treasure of Rule by the evil pirate-lord Bloth. It features 8 different stages in all.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player can control one of the three main characters from the show:Ren - well-balanced, medium strength/medium agilityIoz - heavy, high strength/low agilityTula - quick, low strength/high agility[CR]Version Differences[CR]The Genesis version of Pirates of Dark Water is a side-scrolling platformer. Weapons and items are found throughout levels, without much else to differentiate its light combat. The character models are much smaller and muddied compared to the SNES version, but the levels more closely follow the arch of the early episodes of the series.[CR]The SNES version is a beat-em-up very similar to Final Fight or Golden Axe. Unlike the Genesis version, each character plays noticeably differently. The SNES version sports much improved graphics, colors, and music, more closely conveying the cartoon's unique style.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Use the same characters in 2 player mode[CR]When Press Start is flashing on the title screen, quickly enter the code.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Use the same characters in 2 player mode[CR]When 1P MODE, 2P MODE, OPTIONS is displayed on the title screen, enter the code.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pit-Fighter is a fighting game released by Atari Games in 1990. Though it was widely reviled by critics for its lackluster game play and fighting style, it is notable and revolutionary for being the first fighting game to utilize blue screen-captured digitized versions of real people for use as the games characters. This would later be used by the Mortal Kombat series, among others, to greater effect.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Pit-Fighter was short on available fighters, and only three were available at the select screen: Buzz, Ty and Kato. These three fighters operated in a similar fashion gameplay-wise but had their own unique attacks and fighting styles to make up for this.CharacterDescriptionBuzzBuzz is an ex-pro wrestler, has a slow movement speed but makes up for this in his brutal available attacks which included a body slam, a headbutt, and a pile driver.TyTy is slightly faster than Buzz, though not to a great degree. He has great leg reach due to being a kick boxer, and could execute a roundhouse kick, a flying kick and a spin kick.KatoKato is the most agile of the fighters, is the easiest to KO, but uses very formidable Karate skills to make up for this, such as a powerful backhand, a flip kick and a combo punch.[CR]There were also eight unplayable characters who were, nonetheless, given a digitized sprite just like the main characters, and were available as opponents as the game progressed.[CR]These unplayable characters, in order of appearance, include:Executioner - Wears a hood and flexes his muscles. He is the first available boss.Southside Jim - A black, normal dressing street character, who is extremely fast.Angel - A femme fatale, who has fast combo kicks and incredible agility.C.C. Rider - A generic biker, who has extremely powerful punches but slow speed.Mad Miles - A dreadlocks sporting maniac, has some punishing combos.Heavy Metal - Has a very reminiscent 80's rocker look.Chainman Eddie - Has a chain mail chest and a look close to Bennett from the Arnold Schwarzengger film Commando.Masked Warrior - The final boss, has a terrifying mask and is extremely difficult to KO.[CR]Ports[CR]Though the arcade version of Pit-Fighter quickly became irrelevant due to the introduction of Mortal Kombat and other highly successful fighters, it was ported to many home consoles and portable devices, which included the Amiga, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Amistrad, SNES, Genesis, Atari Lynx, Sinclair Spectrum and Game Boy. These ports varied widely in quality, though all retained the basic characters and gameplay style that Pit-Fighter was known for.[CR]The arcade version of Pit-Fighter was also featured in a recent greatest hit compilation known as Midway Arcade Treasures 2, which was available on Playstation 2, Xbox and Gamecube, as well as a PC-only compilation named Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Plok</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Plok is a side-scrolling action platformer developed by Software Creations (later known as Acclaim Studios Manchester) which was released in 1993 on the SNES. The game is very similar to a lot of the other colorful character-driven platformers of its era, but it distinguished itself with its unique limb-throwing play mechanic and punishing difficulty.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The eponymous Plok.[CR]The game opens with Plok, king of the island of Akrillic in the Poly-Esta archipelago, waking up to discover that his Grandpappy&#8217;s flag which flew proudly over his home has been stolen. Spotting his flag flying on the nearby Cotton Island, Plok sets sail to retrieve it. Once on Cotton Island, Plok makes his way through a series of decoy flags before finally defeating the Bobbins Brothers and retrieving his family heirloom.[CR]Upon his return home, Plok discovers that the theft of his Grandpappy&#8217;s flag was simply for the purpose of luring him away from Akrillic so that it would be left defenseless for the Fleas to take over and raise their flags over the land in the place of Plok&#8217;s. Determined to reclaim his island, Plok sets out to rid the island of the Fleas and their allies. His quest eventually takes him to the depths of the Flea Pit where he must face off against the Flea Queen in order to determine the fate of Akrillic.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Plok engages in the game's first boss fight.[CR]Plok&#8217;s primary ability is that he is able to throw his arms and legs in a boomerang-like manner. This ability can be used both as an attack and to solve certain puzzles which involve Plok giving up a limb in order to activate a switch. With fewer limbs, Plok is less mobile and has less &#8220;ammunition&#8221; to attack with. Limbs used to activate switches can be retrieved from a hanger somewhere else in the level. Plok is also able to perform a spinning high-jump (very similar to Sonic the Hedgehog&#8217;s jumps) which allows him to reach platforms he can&#8217;t with his weak standard jump. After receiving an amulet later in the game, the high-jump can also be used as an attack.[CR]Plok proceeds from level to level via an overworld screen. The path is linear, but levels can be skipped by using warps throughout the game. Warp zones are accessed by hitting specific berries (usually just used to increase health) until they teleport Plok to the warp area. Once in the warp zone, a &#8220;Race Against Time&#8221; event will take place which challenges Plok to get some sort of vehicle through a special level and across the finish line in a limited amount of time. If Plok is successful, he&#8217;ll be transported ahead to a later level of the game, but if he fails, he&#8217;ll be spit back out in the same spot he entered the warp zone.[CR]The world of Poly-Esta is filled with many different items and power-ups for Plok to collect. Shells scattered throughout each level will net him an extra life if he can get enough. They can also be used to fuel his special high-jump attack after the amulet item is received later in the game. Additionally, Plok collects the letters P-L-O-K in order to get &#8220;Plokontinues&#8221; which allow him to continue his journey if he loses all of his lives. Every time Plok defeats a Rockyfella, it will drop a ruby which grants Plok invincibility for a short time. The Razor Wheel pickup will transform Plok into an invincible spinning steel blade that storms through the world with incredible speed. Presents hidden in the world allow Plok to temporarily don one of many costumes that grant him special abilities.[CR]Development History[CR]The character of Plok was originally developed during the late 80&#8217;s by brothers John Pickford and Ste Pickford. The character&#8217;s introduction to the public was to be as the star of a Zippo Games developed coin-op game titled Fleapit, but unfortunately after the game was about half complete it was put on hold and eventually disappeared with the closing of the studio. The Pickford brothers however managed to retain the intellectual property rights to the basic game and character design. This allowed them to commence with development of another similar title that would eventually become the 1993 title Plok.[CR]Game Reception[CR]When the Pickford brothers were first developing Fleapit (the game that would become Plok) during the late 80&#8217;s, the gaming landscape was ripe for an inventive, cute, colorful, character-driven platformer to come along and explode with popularity. However, during the early 90&#8217;s the video game market experienced a massive flood of colorful character-driven platform titles such as Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind, Rayman, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Zool. Thus, by the time Plok was finally released in 1993, it didn&#8217;t seem nearly as fresh as it was when development first started nearly five years ago. Reviews for the game were overall very favorable, but commercially the game was received very poorly and sales were underwhelming. There just wasn&#8217;t enough to distinguish this game from all of the others that appeared so similar. The game has also at times been criticized because of its difficulty and lack of a save or password system.[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the scores of 7,8,9 and 8 with "Sushi-X" exclaiming, "...Plok has got to be one of the most unique games to come out in a while." Ed Semrad wrote, "...while the bosses aren't anything to write home about, the actual game is visually stunning. The challenge level is really high, possibly turning off younger players, but hard-core gamers will love it".[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Warp in the first level of the first world[CR]When you begin the level, head left and jump. Plok will land in the water, get launched out and will end up on an island. There will be a tree with a glowing fruit in it. Hit this fruit 3 times and you will be sent to a new level where you must race against a time limit. If you beat the level before the timer reaches 0, you will warp to the sixth level!</plot>

				<title_clean>Pocky &amp; Rocky</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Battle on a bridge[CR]Pocky &amp; Rocky is an arcade style scrolling shooter with a top-down perspective for the Super Nintendo. Pocky &amp; Rocky was released in Japan in 1992 as Kiki Kaikai: Nazo no Kuro Manto ("Mysterious Ghost World: The Riddle of the Black Mantle") and globally as Pocky &amp; Rocky one year later in 1993. The game is the sequel to the Japan-only Arcade game KiKi KaiKai, which also saw a NES/Famicom spin-off. The protagonists in Pocky &amp; Rocky are a shinto shrine girl named Pocky (Sayo-chan in the original Japanese) and her good friend Rocky (Manuke), who is a tanooki, or raccoon dog. The names of these two characters obviously inspired the game's title. The game had two sequels, Pocky &amp; Rocky 2 on the SNES and Pocky &amp; Rocky with Becky on the Gameboy Advance.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Once upon a time in feudal Japan, Pocky is tending to the shrine at which she works on a dark, seemingly average night. She is visited at the shrine by Rocky the tanooki, and a number of insane nopino goblins, controlled by an unknown force. Pocky and Rocky jump into action, setting off on a journey across Japan, taking on mythical Japanese monsters. They eventually meet Black Mantle, who has been controlling these creatures, and defeats him, saving Japan and its people.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay is a classic top-down shooter style, where players view their character from a bird's eye view, and control their movement and aim where they shoot. The characters shoot enemies and obstacles, Pocky with cards, and Rocky with leaves. Both characters also have a close up attack (Pocky uses a wand, Rocky his tail) which hurts enemies and rebounds projectile attacks. Most enemies take one or two hits to be taken down, andThe first boss[CR]bosses are much tougher. Each player has life of their own, and they must avoid being hit, or else they will lose a life. The game begins giving players a set number of lives that, upon depletion, will result in a game over. Players receive points for good performance, and at certain score milestones, can gain additional lives.[CR]Both characters have special attacks which are used when the short range attack button is held. Pocky will spin, hurting all enemies surrounding her, and Rocky will become invulnerable upon turning into stone. Once per life, characters also have a super attack which will hit multiple enemies on the screen.[CR]Players can also perform a quick slide maneuver in order to move quickly across the stage, however, if players collide while sliding, they will spin out of control. This damages the player, but can also damage enemies while the characters spin.[CR]Power-up collectibles are scattered throughout the game's various levels, each of which provide a boost to the combat proficiency of both Pocky and Rocky. Some of the power ups will make their projectiles larger in size, make the player shoot more projectiles. There are also items which will recover life points or make the character invincible. Whenever a player collects an items, they will gain points for their feat.[CR]Pocky &amp; Rocky has three levels of difficulty: easy, normal, and hard. With each increase in difficulty, enemies become tougher and more numerous, and bosses will gain additional life. There is no reward for completing the game on harder levels.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Pocky &amp; Rocky 2</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pocky &amp; Rocky 2 is a top-down shoot 'em up from Natsume and part of their Kiki Kaikai series of shmups with a cartoonish youkai twist. In Japan the game is known as Kiki Kaikai: Tsukiyozoushi (roughly, "Mysterious Ghost World: Tome of Moonlit Night"). Like the original Pocky &amp; Rocky (a.k.a. Kiki Kaikai: Nazo no Kuro Mantle), Pocky &amp; Rocky 2 was released in Japan, the US and Europe. Natsume published the game in the US and Japan, and the European release was handled by Ocean Software.[CR]The game's plot revolves around a kidnapped princess, abducted by demons led by a character named Impy.

				<title_clean>Populous</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released in 1989, Populous was the third offering of Peter Molyneux's then-nascent UK development studio, Bullfrog Productions, and it was the company's first title to be met with both widespread commercial success and a significant amount of critical recognition. Originally developed for the Amiga, Atari ST, and PC platforms, the premise of Populous is simple: the player is a god, and as such, has world-altering powers that can be used for the betterment of one's own devotees or the detriment of all unbelievers. From an isometric perspective, the player uses both direct control of the game world and indirect interaction with followers in order to ensure the prosperity and growth of their people first and foremost. The player's divine powers grow in direct relation to the overall fortunes of their faithful, and the ultimate objective of each scenario is to become powerful enough to challenge and conquer an opposing deity with worshipers and abilities of its own.European Cover Art[CR]Aside from putting Bullfrog Productions and its designer Peter Molyneux on the proverbial map as game developers, Populous was an influential game in its own right recognized by many as the starting point of the god game, a sub-genre of strategy/simulation games in which players are cast as powerful beings whose prime directive is the stewardship of their followers. Many of the mechanics laid down in Populous would be used in future Bullfrog games (Powermonger and Dungeon Keeper, for instance), and Molyneux's first project at Lionhead Studios, 2001's Black &amp; White, is commonly viewed as an attempt to evolve the ideas presented in the Populous games, and as a result is often called the spiritual successor to the series. Furthermore, games made thereafter, such as 2011's From Dust, that feature environmental manipulation for the specific purpose of aiding a group of people outside of the player's direct control are usually said to draw their lineage directly from Populous.[CR]The success of Populous led to two expansions, The Promised Lands and The Final Frontier (both of which were released in 1989), as well as two sequels, Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods in 1992, and Populous: The Beginning in 1998. In 2008, an updated port of Populous dubbed Populous DS was released for the Nintendo DS by Japanese developer Genki. It was created with the ostensible goal of "retaining the feel" of the original Populous while also adding new features such as updated visuals, touch screen support, wireless multiplayer, and five new gods each with distinct gameplay differences.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game interface: mini-map (upper left), Manna Bar and Information Shield (upper right), command icons (lower left), and playing field (center)[CR]The most important imperative in the game is the growth of one's follower population (hence the game's name). The player can facilitate faster growth primarily by ensuring that followers have adequate surfaces upon which to build their settlements. The more uniform the landscape, the larger the settlement that can be built there, and larger settlements reward players with greater defense and better technology. Smaller settlements do have their place, though, as they are quicker to erect and much faster to populate, making for much more rapid expansion. Population size affects what abilities the player has access to, as all physical manifestations of divine power cost manna, and this manna is directly derived from followers, thus more of one means more of the other. Additionally, since the player exerts no direct control over their subjects, having a numerical advantage is the easiest way to ensure victory when encountering rival followers. Many godly powers, such as Earthquake and Volcano, are directly designed to hinder an opponent's ability to effectively settle their land and thus grow stronger.[CR]Once one's follower population has grown to a sufficient size, the player's main goal is to overcome an enemy deity whose presence threatens their own supremacy. Encounters with the enemy will happen as a natural byproduct of expansion on most maps, though when the time comes followers can also be directed specifically to seek out and subdue opposing settlers. In order to be fully victorious and move on to the next map, all enemy followers and domiciles must be killed or destroyed. Opposing forces will automatically fight when they come into contact with one another, and the victor is determined purely on relative strength, which is in turn determined by the number of followers in a stack and the level of technology they possess. Settlement size comes into play here once again, as larger buildings allow for greater technological achievements than smaller ones. The number of citizens within a stack can be increased manually by ordering followers to gather together; any two friendly units which contact one another will combine into a single, stronger unit.ModesA mysterious confidant congratulates the player between missions.[CR]Populous has three main modes of play: Tutorial, Conquest, and Custom. The Tutorial mode consists of a preset map designed more than anything to allow players to familiarize themselves with the game's controls and the various powers at their disposal. Conquest is the main mode of Populous, which allows players to progress through a series of 500 maps, conquering one world at a time before moving on to the next. Player performance is key to progression in this mode, as the player does not simply progress in linear fashion through each map. Rather, the player's score at the end of each mission is taken as an indicator of one's relative skill, and the difficulty of the next mission is chosen as a direct reflection of said score. Mission objective do not change over the course of Conquest mode, though the aptitude of one's opposition (as well as the powers available to them) will increase over time. Several different terrain types come into play as well, though their effects on gameplay is decidedly subtle. Settlers can die more easily on a desert world, for example, and population growth is stunted on an ice planet. Though the player can save their game at any time, the name of each planet also serves as a password of sorts, allowing players to jump to a specific world by simply inputting its name. The final mode of play is Custom, which pulls triple duty of serving as the game's portal for playing scenarios with customized parameters, creating custom maps, and also connecting to a second player (via modem) for multiplayer skirmishes.Inspecting the Game WorldThe Information Shield, complete with Population Bars (sides)[CR]Seeing as the player has no real dominion over the individual activities of worshipers, various tools are provided to allow players to quickly survey their surroundings and also gauge the level of efficacy of followers and buildings. Individual targets can be selected at any time by using the Query button, which causes a shield icon to appear next to the selected object. This indicates that any information appearing in the upper-right status shield pertains specifically to this target (which can in turn be located at any time by using the Zoom to Shield button). The status shield is divided into four quadrants. The quadrant in the upper left simply indicates which side the selected target belongs to, with an ankh signifying good, and a skull signifying evil. The quadrant to its right shows the target's level of sophistication, with more advanced weapon icons indicating a greater level of technology. The lower left quadrant shows a representation of the selected target, while the lower right displays two bars. In the case of a building, these bars show overall defense in yellow on the left, and progress toward production of the next follower in green on the right. In the case of followers, two orange bars showing unit strength fill over time. Once both bars have been filled, the left bar changes to yellow, indicating that it is gauging higher strength values than before. On either side of the Information Shield are two additional bars which show the population size of both the good and evil players on the left and right sides respectively.QueryQueryThe Query button allows the player to quickly ascertain the strength of a given target, whether they be friendly or hostile. Querying a target will persist until another target is queried, so it is possible, for instance, to use it as an easy way to keep track of an opposing leader's activities, or, when used with Zoom to Shield, to be able to quickly shift focus to a location of the player's choosing.Zoom to ShieldZoom to ShieldThe Zoom to Shield command serves to quickly refocus the player's field of view upon the last queried target. Naturally, if the player has yet to use the Query function, the Zoom to Shield icon does nothing. This mainly serves to allow players to quickly see something that might not be covered by other Zoom functions.Zoom to LeaderZoom to LeaderPressing the Zoom to Leader button, unsurprisingly, centers the player's view upon the leader of their followers. If the player's people are currently leaderless, then this function will center the field of view upon the player's Papal Magnet, usually the site of their leader's demise, until such time as a new leader has been chosen.Zoom to KnightZoom to KnightThe function of the Zoom to Knight button changes depending on whether the player left- or right-clicks. Upon left-clicking, it will cycle between all knights that the player currently possesses; when right-clicking, however, it will rotate its focus instead through all of the player's various settlements.Zoom to BattleZoom to BattleA simple click of the Zoom to Battle button will jump the camera instantly to any active hostile engagements, and, if there are more than one, it will cycle between all confrontations upon additional clicks. Like most Zoom functions, if there are no valid targets to jump to, pressing the button has no effect.Divine Mandates[CR]Though no true control is given over one's followers (alternately called walkers) in Populous, as the object of their worship the player is given the prerogative to direct the focus of their attentions. There are four options for influencing the behavior of walkers, and regardless of which is chosen, the player's people will dutifully endeavor to conform to this mandate in order to better satisfy their god. Directives do not require manna in the same way that physical manifestations of power do, though at the same time their effects are not nearly as dramatic nor as immediate.Go to MagnetGo to MagnetThe Go to Magnet command instructs all followers to gather around their leader, who will in turn go toward the Papal Magnet. In situations where the player's leader has died, this instructs followers to head directly toward the Magnet, where the first follower to touch the Magnet will be appointed the new leader.SettleSettleFaithful who have been directed to settle will look around their environment for suitable land upon which to erect new buildings, with preference being given for unexplored areas. Regardless of where they choose to settle, settlers will always construct the largest settlement that their particular plot of land allows.Gather TogetherGather TogetherThe Gather Together function implores a player's followers to search for others of their tribe so that they might commune with them. If successful, the two walkers will band together, forming a single more powerful unit. If unsuccessful in finding others, a follower will simply attempt to construct more settlements.FightFightWalkers that have been instructed to fight will actively search for any non-allied units and attempt to defeat them before repeating the process. Much like the Gather Together mandate, if a follower is unable to find suitable targets in its immediate vicinity, it will choose instead to build new settlements.Divine Intervention[CR]Often it is required that a god take matters into its own hands, and for these situations there are a variety of choices for direct intervention. Just below the player's Information Shield is the Manna Bar, which shows what godly powers are currently available for use. Various icons representing specific powers are arrayed along this bar, and once the Manna Bar's indicator arrow has reached the icon for a specific power, this indicates that it can be used. These range from minor displays like slightly modifying the height of land to more cataclysmic ones like Armageddon. Having a larger number of followers will raise the manna indicator arrow quicker and also allow for more frequent use of powers, as manna can be replenished more quickly with more devotees.Raise/Lower LandRaise/Lower LandThe least expensive and ironically most important of the godly powers is the ability to raise and lower land, which helps primarily to make the environment more habitable for one's followers. Left-clicking while in this mode will raise the plot of land where the player's cursor currently resides, while right-clicking will lower it.Papal MagnetPapal MagnetPlacing a Papal Magnet on any are of the map will designate that point as a beacon to which allied followers are drawn. When a leader dies or is knighted, the Papal Magnate's position is fixed to the last place that the leader occupied, and cannot be repositioned until the player has appointed a new leader through the Go to Magnet command.EarthquakeEarthquakeThe Earthquake ability randomly rearranges all tiles withinin the player's current field of view, disrupting settlements and any other activities within the area. As the cheapest disruption spell available in most scenarios, it is one of the more common ways of hindering the development of rival walkers.SwampSwampUse of the Swamp ability creates a swamp on any flat surface within the field of view. Depending on mission parameters, this will swallow up either a single walker or all walkers who attempt to traverse it. Swamp tiles can only be destroyed by raising or lowering the land tile upon which they are situated.KnightKnightBy invoking the Knight ability, the player's current leader is transformed into a powerful knight that will tirelessly harass the enemy, killing walkers and burning settlements to the ground until it is killed. It is possible for a player to have multiple knights concurrently by selecting and knighting new leaders through the Papal Magnet.VolcanoVolcanoThe area within the field of view is dramatically raised and filled with rocky obstructions when the player summons a volcano. Use of this ability is primarily a disruption tactic much like the use of Earthquake, though the effects are much more time-consuming to reverse than its cheaper cousin.FloodFloodUnlike most land-altering invocations, Flood affects the entire map rather than limiting itself to only the player's field of view, raising the water level of the entire world by one. Special care should be taken before using it to ensure that one's own population won't be more adversely affected by this than the enemy's.ArmageddonArmageddonEssentially a game-ender, Armageddon razes all buildings on the map and calls all followers to the center of the level in order to wage a winner-takes-all showdown in which the player left standing is the ultimate victor. For players who are sure of their own tribe's superiority, this can save a significant amount of hassle.[CR]</plot>

One of the many fighting games published in the early 90's to capitalize on the success of Capcom's Street Fighter II, it did not achieve the success of its competition, and was largely ignored by most gamers.[CR]The gameplay is that of a traditional head-to-head fighting game. But unlike most games of its type, the single-player mode is limited to one character, Joe, who is the protagonist of the game. One of the game's most distinctive aspects is an RPG-like system which enables the player to boost Joe's various attributes, such as strength, speed and endurance. Another gimmick is the use of a two-plane fighting area (similar to that of Fatal Fury).[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]- Despite the difference in name for the Genesis and Super Nintendo versions, there was no actual difference in gameplay, content or characters. However, it is widely believed that the game's box cover and title were renamed only to keep up with Nintendo's stringent no-violence policy, as the Genesis cart features a closeup of a character being punched in the face, with a torrent of blood erupting from the impact. The SNES version's box featured the same image, with the red blood re-colored to look like sweat (the same tactic used with Mortal Kombat).[CR]- Although the Genesis version known as "Deadly Moves" featured a blood-spattered cover, there was no blood or finishing moves of any kind in the game.[CR]- The US magazine ad for the game, while detailing its features, did not feature any actual screenshots from the game, but crudely drawn ones that did not resemble the game at all.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Play as Ranker in versus mode[CR]EYV G9DG 2Q7[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Moves[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Fight Last Boss[CR]In the 1Player Game Input The password below.</plot>

Bruno comes equipped with a sword and the ability to throw donuts that he finds throughout the six levels of the game. Bruno also has the ability to jump and to also butt slam crates. No description of this game would be complete without mentioning the blowholes which are liberally sprinkled throughout each level. These blowholes will lift Bruno in the air so that he will be able to get to higher plateaus that he simply couldn't get to by just jumping normally.</plot>

				<plot>Power Rangers Zeo: Battle Racers was a SNES game released in September 1996 by Bandai. The game was based on the Zeo generation of Power Rangers. It featured Mode 7 graphics much like many of the SNES 'Kart' style games in the period. The game allowed for single play or 2 player split screen racing or battle mode. The game is often considered to be the only game based on the Zeo series, however another game, Power Rangers Zeo Versus The Machine Empire, was made for the PC.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Bonus course and character[CR]Finish in first place in every course to obtain a score of 320 points.

				<title_clean>Primal Rage</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Primal Rage is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Atari for arcades in 1994. Players control one of seven giant beasts (who are rendered in stop-motion animation) who must battle each other to conquer a post-apocalyptic neo-Stone Age Earth (known in the game as "Urth"). Although not as popular as the also-violent Mortal Kombat franchise, the game spawned toys, comic books, and a novel, as well as many ports.[CR]A sequel (simply named Primal Rage II) was in development, but was canceled (though some early prototypes have been found).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Primal Rage plays like a traditional 2D fighting game. Along with a joystick, each player has four buttons arranged in a square (horizontally from Quick to Fierce and vertically from High to Low). Pressing both High Quick and High Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful High Power attack, while pressing both Low Quick and Low Fierce simultaneously executes a powerful Low Power attack.[CR] Unlike traditional fighting games, where special moves are executed by first moving the joystick in a combination and then pressing one or more buttons, Primal Rage includes a system where special moves are executed by holding down certain buttons and then moving the joystick. Fatalities (glorified execution moves that can only be performed at the end of the winner's winning round) are also performed in this way. However, later arcade versions and most ports also include the traditional special move/fatality execution alongside this way.[CR]During the fight, human worshipers from the tribes of both fighters are scattered in the background. All characters have a special move (with unique combinations) which allows them to devour humans that enter the foreground (giving back some of the player's health). Devouring enemy worshipers also grant the player bonus points, while devouring friendly worshipers take away from the player's score.[CR]After defeating all seven opponents In the single-player campaign, the player has dominated Urth. But the beast still needs to prepare for one giant final battle to keep its place as "king of the hill". A bonus round occurs where the player has a limited amount of time to devour friendly worshipers (with no point loss) and flying pterodactyls for bonus health (that is used after the player's health has depleted in the final battle). During the final battle in the hellish "dinosaur graveyard", the player must survive against all seven opponents consecutively in one giant round. If the player loses both the initial health and the bonus health, he can immediately restore his initial health by continuing. The player is granted more points at the end of the campaign by using less continues.[CR]Characters [CR] The character select screen with the seven playable characters.[CR]The game includes seven playable characters. (Six in the Game Boy and Game Gear versions) A final boss character was planned for the final stage, but was scrapped. Sauron and Diablo are palette swaps of each other, while Blizzard and Chaos are also palette swaps. (However, Diablo and Chaos are smaller than Sauron and Blizzard in terms of size) Sauron Talon Vertigo (not available in the Game Boy and Game Gear versions) Blizzard Chaos Armadon Diablo[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Prince of Persia 1989[CR]Prince of Persia was originally released in 1989 for the  Apple II by  Jordan Mechner. Mechner used film of his younger brother David running, jumping, and performing many of the Prince's actions. Mechner then  rotoscoped the film to create the animations that give the  Prince his fluid movement.[CR]Part of the game's appeal was its then unique focus on  environmental puzzle-solving, as well as its one-on-one  sword duels. Mechner has stated that the game was inspired by the first ten minutes of Raiders of the Lost Ark, for the character's  acrobatics in a  dangerous environment.[CR]Prince of Persia has since been ported to a number of different platforms, including the  Amiga,  Apple Macintosh, DOS,  NES,  Game Boy,  Sega Genesis,  Game Gear,  SNES,  Sharp X68000,  Atari ST, and SAM Coup&#233;.[CR]The music was written by Jordan Mechner's father,  Francis Mechner.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Prince of Persia is a platformer with heavy emphasis on careful jumping and environmental puzzle solving. The player controls the Prince as he attempts to  rescue his princess before she  weds  Jaffar, the evil Grand Vizier. Jaffar has trapped the  Princess, and given her an hour to decide whether she wishes to marry him or die. This hour unfolds in  real time, and the only way to lose the game is to fail to reach the Princess within sixty minutes.[CR]The player is given only an hour to navigate the game's thirteen levels and rescue her. Scattered throughout each level are hidden  switches, secret  pitfalls and a variety of other hazards standing in the Prince's way of rescuing his beloved. There are also hidden  potions that have a variety of effects on the Prince.[CR]The player will have to explore and pay attention to their environment in order to solve the puzzles and make it to the end. The Prince will also have to fight his way past  guards to reach the Princess. Combat exists as a series of sword fights, which were unusual for its time when  projectile weapons were the norm.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The Sultan of Persia, one day, leaves to wage war in a foreign land. His Grand Vizier, Jaffar, steps in to take his  throne while he is away. Shortly thereafter, a street urchin decides to climb the Royal Tower to see the Princess, whom people have claimed to be as beautiful as a new moon. When the young  orphan finally sees the Princess,  they fall in love. The couple intend to marry.[CR]The Vizier discovers this and decides that he wants to marry the Princess. He throws the street urchin into the lowest  dungeon and locks the Princess in the highest tower. He then gives the Princess one hour, counted on a magical  hourglass, in which she has to decide to marry the Vizier or die.[CR]The street urchin's main goal is to defeat Jaffar and reach the Princess.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The SNES version[CR]Aside from being ported to several different platforms, Prince of Persia has received  two  proper  sequels and a  3D remake.  Ubisoft re-imagined the series with its  Sands of Time  trilogy, and the French publisher again rebooted the series with a new game, titled simply  Prince of Persia. A motion picture based on  Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is also being developed, Mike Newell directing, and is being produced by  Jerry Bruckheimer. The movie was released in 2010 starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Gemma Arterton, and  Ben Kingsley and was received with average reviews.[CR]The game was  ported many times, and version such as the  SNES one which improved on the original. In the SNES game, the graphics were updated, and the game was given 20 levels, and an extra hour to complete the game.[CR]The original Prince of Persia has sold over 2 million copies.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Gear version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 8,8,7,5 adding, "...very impressed with this version of the game. Not only were all the characters and pitfalls very easy to see on the small screen, but even the very fluid animation found on the other versions of the game was duplicated almost perfectly".[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Cheat Menu (NTSC version only)[CR]Enter "SPECIAL" as a password, then during gameplay, pause and press B, Y, Up, Down, Left, Right, L, R, Start+Select. The cheat menu contains a level select, a sound test, and an option to give the Prince additional units of health. Also, you can press X during gameplay to kill all enemies currently on-screen.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter the following at the password screen:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Princess in the Sky[CR]At the beginning of level 20, move right to the window.

				<plot>Pro Quarterback is a football game featuring 27 different teams. Since this game doesn't have an NFL or NFLPA license, there aren't any real NFL teams or players here, although the teams included in the game represent the cities of their real life NFL counterparts and also mimic the colors of their team's uniforms.[CR]The games options allow the player to choose to play on 6 different field surfaces (grass, mud, dirt, snow, rain and artificial turf) and to choose how long the game will last (2, 5, 10 or 15 minute quarters). There are also no penalties in this game whatsoever. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] consists of playing on both offense and defense. There are 26 different offensive plays and 18 different defensive plays to choose from. The game has a down the field view when on offense, so the game doesn't have receivers in windows.</plot>

				<plot>This hockey game includes 24 NHL teams and 288 NHLPA players. The NES version contains an exhibition, training and a super cup mode. The SNES version has a practice and a season mode. The training mode in the NES version allows you to practice both offense and defense. The training mode in the SNES version lets you either practice in an exhibition game or compete in a shootout. The super cup is based on the round-robin format in the NES version. The teams chosen to compete in the super cup are decided by the teams rankings from the season mode in the SNES version.[CR]The game is played with a top down view of the hockey rink, with the screen scrolling vertically as the puck carrier heads towards a net.</plot>

His latest mission is to gain access to the crazy world of Captain Rat's Treasure Caves. Very straightforward..... NOT![CR]You see, this particular cave is a tunnel entrance to Domino Domain - a mini- world comprised of nine different continents. G.I. must negotiate many screens of mind-teasing problems. Each level has a door to the next. To open the door, the 'Trigger' domino-block must be felled by causing a chain reaction with all of the other domino-blocks in that level. Pretty easy.....

				<plot>It was believed on Earth that the deadly BYDO Empire had been destroyed--but now they've returned, as nasty as ever. Their ships and armies are more powerful than before, and Earth will surely be conquered unless the new R-90 ship can destroy them. Powered with engines that launch it into different dimensions, and armed with the Round, Shadow, and Cyclone Forces, R-90 has what it takes to wipe out the BYDO threat. Then, the BYDO mother ship must be found and destroyed to entirely erase the species from our galaxy.</plot>

Following in the tracks of its predecessor, Race Drivin' continues with the 3D polygon presentation and provides four different vehicles for the player to use. The player can then select between a racing track and two stunt-focused tracks. Race Drivin' debuted in the Arcades and was converted for many home computers and consoles of the era.[CR]Race Drivin' was eventually followed up by Hard Drivin' II.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>RPM was a successful remake of the Commodore 64 program Racing Destruction Set, developed by Electronic Arts in 1985. It claims to be the first American-developed game for the SNES system.[CR]RPM was one of the first SNES games developed in 'High Resolution Graphics Mode' which allowed for sharper detail but fewer colors. While the higher resolution gave finer detail, it also severely limited the number of colors and amount of unique graphics that could be displayed from the SNES video memory. Due to this, the sequel to RPM (RPMII which was later renamed Rock N' Roll Racing) was developed in the lower resolution graphics mode allowing for much more vibrant colors and graphic detail.[CR]The logic engine and track editor for RPM were ported from an older EA title Racing Destruction Set. The 6502 assembly code was modified for 16 bit but otherwise mostly left intact.[CR]There is an easter egg in the game on Track 29 which spells 'Eat Me' very clearly. This surprisingly made it through Nintendo's QA process and wasn't mentioned in any of the post reviews of the game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]:[CR]In the game, players can race in a regular season, a single race, and even get to create their own course. The courses can be straight and oval like NASCAR, curvy and flat like Formula One, or hilly and unpredictable like a monster truck track. The winner gets money and a chance to score his initials for the fastest time.[CR]Development:[CR]RPM was developed using the 'Sluggo' development system created by Bill Heineman and his partner which allowed uploading of bin files to a device that emulated a cartridge for the SNES. System did not include step through or trace functionality.[CR]RPM was programmed in 65816 Assembly Language using a cross compiler on an IBM computer.[CR]Development took 5 months and was programmed almost exclusively by Allen Adham with graphics supplied by Interplay.[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Racing[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] $45 million dollars[CR]To start a new game with fourty-five million dollars,  first select an empty file and use the B button to enter the shop screen.  Choose any of the three cars by pressing B.  Then move the red selection box to the bottom center square.  Then press B, Left, B, Left, B, Right, B, Right, B, B, B, Left, B, B, B, Right, B, Right, B, B.  The red box should be one square right of where you put it it and you will have 45 million dollars.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] $45 million dollars[CR]If you create a custom map with a useless loop, it confuses the computer opponents, and removes them.  This is usefull if you want to race a friend, but you don't want to deal with the pesky computer.</plot>

				<plot>Radical Rex is a fire-breathing Tyrannosaurus on a skateboard who has to save the dinosaur race under the spell of an evil creature. The game consists of 10 levels set in the prehistoric age. Radical Rex can use a skateboard or glide down hills, jump, kick and breath fire. Tougher enemies need multiple hits and when burnt Rex needs to kick them once more to destroy them or use his scream (hits everything on the screen). While playing Rex collects eggs, health, power-ups for his fire breath and scream refills. Checkpoints are shown as torches that need to be charged with fire. After each level, there is a Bomberman-like sequence to earn an extra continue. Enemies include flies, turtles, toads and all kinds of dinosaurs.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rampart is a strategy/puzzle/action game in which the player alternately builds fortifications and then destroys invading enemy forces with the artillery within those fortifications. After which, the player then has to rebuild their damaged walls and add even more defensive means for the stronger enemy rounds to come. Created by Atari for the Arcades, the game would later see many home releases on a plethora of platforms.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls a handful of castles which must be defended and repaired all within a brisk time-limit. Ships will attack the fortress typically with cannon-fire, and the player must retaliate with their own arsenal, doing their best to protect the castle. They can build walls around their castles to absorb damage, but the player will ultimately need to get a bit creative to survive the increasingly tougher sieges.[CR]The player can place additional cannons within walls if they have been placed correctly. Ideally, the player is able to construct as many cannon enclosures as possible to maximize their offensive output and repel the enemy forces without incurring too much damage.[CR]In single-player, the player starts out by choosing where their fortress will be placed. They're then surrounded by a wall, and can then place their cannons. Following this are a set of rounds; the first being attack, the second repair. After surviving this barrage, the player is given additional time to place more cannons in their fort. The game ends when the player fails to successfully repair their castle, or when enough of the enemy fleet has been sunk.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Ranma 1-2 - Hard Battle</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ranma 1/2: Hard Battle (known in Japan as Ranma 1/2: Bakuretsu Rantou Hen, or "Ranma 1/2: Exploding Brawl") is a one-on-one fighting game featuring the cast of the Rumiko Takahashi manga and anime Ranma 1/2. Originally released on the Super Famicom in 1992, it is the only Ranma 1/2 video game that was officially localized for distribution in North America with the exception of Street Combat; a western version of Ranma 1/2: Chounai Gekitou Hen that was reskinned to remove its relation to Ranma.Characters[CR]Ranma 1/2: Hard Battle features ten fighters (technically twelve, as two characters can fight in two separate forms) as well as an unplayable boss character. In the single player, each fighter is taking part in a tournament due to a promise or a suggestion made by Principal Kuno, though most of them have been coerced or tricked into competing.Ranma Saotome - Ranma is the protagonist of the series and, like many Ranma characters, has a "cursed" form due to falling into a cursed spring while training. This cursed form is a female version of himself, who is slightly faster but also physically weaker - their movesets are otherwise identical. The player can choose to fight as either form. Because he's let his studies fall to the wayside to focus on his fighting, he takes part in the tournament for the promise of being given top grades.Genma Saotome - Genma is Ranma's father and taught him martial arts, though Ranma quickly surpassed him in skill. Genma's cursed form is that of a giant panda, and this is the only form that is playable. Genma competes in the tournament to knock some sense into his rebellious son. Ryoga Hibiki - Ryoga is Ranma's self-proclaimed rival, and has a similar moveset. His cursed form is that of a tiny adorable black piglet with zero fighting ability. Ryoga wakes up in the Principal's office with amnesia, and is fighting in order to get his memory back.Akane Tendo - Scion of the powerful Tendo dojo and semi-reluctant arranged fiance&#233; of Ranma, Akane enters the tournament to deter her many admirers from bothering her.Shampoo - Another of Ranma's fiance&#233;s, Shampoo enters the tournament hoping to impress him with her fighting prowess. Her cursed form is that of a cat, an animal Ranma is phobic towards. She's the fastest character in the game and can even double jump.Hikaru Gosunkugi - A student obsessed with voodoo and the occult, who has a crush on Akane. He fights to win her over. He uses occult items like a straw voodoo doll in combat.Ukyo Kuonji - Another of Ranma's brides-to-be and a dedicated okonomiyaki chef, she is convinced to enter the tournament in order to prove her strength as a fighter and businesswoman. She fights with spatulas.Gambling King - A nefarious figure who looks like one of the kings from a deck of playing cards, he enters the tournament to make enough money to build his very own casino. He's one of the slowest and weakest characters, and thus the most challenging to beat the game with.Mousse - Shampoo's childhood friend, his love for her is unrequited and he blames (male) Ranma for catching her eye. He is tricked into fighting in the tournament by the Principal in a fortune teller disguise, who tells him that his happiness is dependent on winning the contest. Despite being nearly blind, he is an adept fighter who flings hidden objects at his opponents.Pantyhose Taro - The unfortunately-named Pantyhose is an antagonist of the series and serves as the final boss for most of the game's characters. His cursed form is that of a mighty chimera or demon, and characters either end up fighting him in his human or his monstrous form. He is unlocked as a playable character for story mode once beaten, though he can be played in Versus mode from the offset.Happosai - Happosai is a very small but indescribably powerful martial artist as well as a perverted old man. Pantyhose must defeat him as the boss of his story mode in order to receive a new name. He is unplayable.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the review scores of 7,8,7,8 and 8. Mike Weigand wrote, "Purists and fans will immediately be repelled by the 'Americanized' voices, but others will find a very good one-on-one fighting game. The fighters are very original, as are their many moves".[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]After choosing a character, hold R + X + A. The debug menu will appear before the round starts.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]When you select Versus Mode, if both players hold L+R, they can select the same character.  If player 1 does this in Team Battle, they can pick a team of characters for the computer to play against them.  This can also be done in standard Versus Mode.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]At the Game Mode select screen, press Select, X, Up, Left, Down, Right, Up. If done right, the names of the character will appear on top and you can choose to see all their visual scenes.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Alternate credits[CR]Beat the game on hard to see a different credits sequence featuring the transformed charactersNote that this is only needs to be done on the JP release as it is already the default ending in the other versions.</plot>

				<title_clean>Rap Basketball</title_clean>
				<plot>This game is a rather incomplete half-court basketball video game that was supposed to feature rappers Ice-T and LL Cool J. The development team was contracted to make the game by an outside company (presumably Eware), but since that company went under, so did Rap Basketball. This publisher supposedly had liscenses from the rappers, but the developers are kind of sceptical about it. This game is completely unrelated to Mandigo's Rap Jam Vol. 1, and was being developed earlier.[CR]Thanks to the developers for providing the game.[CR]Developer : Bonsai Entertainment Corporation (website)[CR]Programmer: Joseph "Holy Joe Rock &amp; Roll" Moses[CR]Artist : Charles Moses &amp; (Nameless Guy from Tahoe)[CR]Here is an interview with Holy Joe:[CR]Q. For 'Rap Basketball', what companies were you freelancing for?[CR]A. OK, RBB was a real cluster-fu*K.[CR]Our original contract was with a company in Tahoe, CA [E*WARE?] who claimed to have a deal with Motown-Games. Then he never paid us and vanished into out-of-business. I contacted Motown a few months later (finally) and they had signed another deal with someone for RAPJAM vol.1. They claimed to not know we were doing the actual development work.[CR]Then we had a second contract with a publicly traded company. These guys bounced our 1st check and refused to pay us. I sued them and forced then in to bankruptcy, then they vanished. Rough business, these guys really sucked!![CR]Q. Did you have any contact with LL Cool J or Ice T's managers?[CR]A. These guys were totally cool. I talked to them about signing "HOLYJOE Rock and Roll" as a White Rapper and they were going to bankroll the whole thing.... it was awesome, I had a bunch of "bitches and hoes" all over me.... then....[CR]Naw, I'm just kidding. I never met these guys. LAUGHING OUT LOUD.[CR]Q. Was Rap Jam Vol. 1 planned before Rap Basketball or after?[CR]A. Developed after and by someone else.[CR]Q. What made you stop developing Rap Basketball at such an early state?[CR]A. We never got paid :-( IT really sucked.[CR]Q. Around what year were you developing Rap Basketball?[CR]A. It was in mid-late 1994 if I remember correctly.[CR]Q. Did you have the license arrangments made with Nintendo yet?[CR]A. We would have been all set. We were licensed developers and the publisher would have been ok.[CR]Q. Who was your artist at the time?[CR]A. There were a couple of artist. My brother Charles worked on most of it - but also a guy from Tahoe did some of the early stuff.[CR]Q. Who programmed the music? It sounds an awful like a Genesis chiptune that was recorded and tracked.[CR]A. I think we just dropped something in there as a place holder.[CR]Q. What was your impression about the game? Did you want to program it?[CR]A. At the time we were pretty excited. No one had done a Rapper based game like this YET. We wanted to finish it.[CR]Q. Finally... Why wasn't it finished?[CR]A. Well, since we never got paid, we had to do something else that would make us some $. We just could not survive doing stuff for free. [CR]As you can see, this game is an early alpha. The basic gameplay is half-court, 2-on-2 basketball. However, your opponents are frozen in place, your teammate just follows you around, and you can't score points. The basketball is controlled with the A button, which causes it to bounce around (you don't need to hold the ball to make it bounce). You make your character run with the X button. Since you can't shoot, playing this is rather pointless. Pressing start brings up the company logos. The background graphics are fairly nice, but the sprits are faceless and run around like limp wristed apes. On a nice note, the music track is very cool.[CR]Reviewer: Evan G[CR]http://www.snescentral.com/article.php?id=0137[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rap Jam Volume One is basketball video game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System released in 1995. It features various popular rap artists at that time as the basketball players.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Rap Jam plays very much like a standard basketball game.

Critics of this title have cited the lack of music; awkward controls; uncontrollable, random player changing; and quick repetitiveness of gameplay on a whole as reasons for disliking it.

				<plot>[CR]Realm is a side-scrolling platforming shooter released near the end of the SNES era. Players control a long haired blond cyborg in his quest to defeat aliens.Story[CR]The player controls a teenage cyborg only known as Biomech. His task is to push back the invading alien forces threatening a futuristic earth. His quest begins at the last bastion of human resistance nestled in the forest. Fighting endless hordes of aliens with any weapons found, he must infiltrate each of the four "realms" now under alien control. His only hope in saving earth is in defeating the leader of the aliens residing in a battle ship orbiting earth.Gameplay[CR]The player has a wide array of weapons that are found within levels however only two weapons can be help at once. All weapons have ammunition except for Biomechs starting pistol. Ammunition can be acquired by either collecting another instance of a weapon or by shooting yellow crystals commonly found throughout the game. The player can collect shield symbols to increase health as well as a power-up providing temporary invulnerability. Any contact with enemy's will result in health loss and falling into canyons or off the level immediately kill the player. Each realm has a preliminary boss then a final boss before moving to the next area.WeaponsWeaponDamageTraitLaser Pistol1Infinite ammoAD3502Heat-seekingVFR7502Rapid-fireNR7501-4Charge-attackLC-30 "Ring"5Large laser streamGSX7504Machine gunSR5003Rocket launcherCBR6003Boomerang missilesTR12Spread-shot[CR]Although there are many weapon types, players often use the LC-30 and AD350. A common strategy is to acquire the AD350 "heat-seeking" gun and simply shoot straight up, while avoiding enemy fire. This allows the player to focus solely of the platforming aspects of the game. The LC-30 is often saved for boss encounters as it is the highest damage weapon with a constant stream of fire.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]After holding Up + X + B + R + Start at the title screen(invinsibility)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]Press Start + Select during game play to jump to the next level</plot>

				<title_clean>Relief Pitcher</title_clean>
				<plot>Relief Pitcher is without a doubt, one of the best presented sports games on the SNES. It has all the bells and wistles you would expect out of modern baseball video games, which is an impressive feat on a 16 bit game. However, its lack of options leave this game as somewhat of a disappointment.[CR]This game is pretty devoid of options with only two modes of play. It lets you play out a series of game scenarios (12 in total) from the 9th inning, hence "Relief Pitcher". It also has a full game mode. There are no full season modes or any really mindblowing options that you would not expect from a baseball game (i.e. switching the batting order, pitcher, etc). The two player mode has similar options[CR]As far as graphics and sounds are concerned, Relief Pitcher is excellent. The players and stadiums are well animated, though some of the player images that pop up before each bat look a bit goofy. The game uses a behind-the-catcher view, and when there is a hit, it merely rotates the screen a bit, rather than moving the camera to where the ball is going. There are only four teams, but the stadium characteristics are similar to their real life counterparts (for instance, the Boston team has the green monster) There is full voice commentary, which is rather novel for a Super NES game. The game doesn't contain much in the way of music, aside from the menu screens.[CR]As far as gameplay goes, Relief Pitcher suffers. The pitching setup (with a strength gauge) is similar to many golf games, and works very well, and there is a box that shows the strike zone. However, batting seems to be an exercise of randomness. You have the option of weak swing, strong swing and bunt, but I did not seem to find any sort of strategy of when you can actually hit one out of the park. I found that there were far too many opposite field hits, which seem kind of odd. You have no control over fielding the ball, which is the worst thing. I thought that the outfielders wait far too long to go after a ball. Rather than manually controlling which way the player runs, you have to press a button to tell the player to run, and he always goes towards a base.[CR]On the whole, the main complaint about Relief Pitcher is that it has a distinct lack of options. Though this game goes for realism and presentation, quite frankly it is boring. I would suggest looking for other baseball games, even a primitive game like Super Bases Loaded has more variety.

You start as the dimwitted cat Stimpy who has to search through the different levels of a firehouse to find these objects to proceed: a helmet, hose, pair of socks, rope, trampoline, uniform, and a beaver(!).  They all have to be placed on a fire truck before time runs out.  You can jump, climb up stairs and firepoles, and grab items while avoiding or putting out fires with water and eluding a speedy fireman by painting yourself like a dalmatian to avoid getting thrown out. [CR]A short 30 second bonus round follows where you must find Ren, the psychotic chihuahua.  This is followed by another 30 second round to bounce as many bags of Gritty Kitty Litter into a bin as you can.[CR]The second level has both Ren and Stimpy holding the trampoline to catch objects falling from a burning building.  Again, there is a time limit by which all items must be caught.  If successful, you return to the firehouse again the next day and must survive a week to gain the award of the Sacred Golden Fire Hydrant Helmets.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Last Stage password[CR]Press the right and left buttons the correct ammount of times in the password screen to go to the last level.[CR]You have to select a hat, hair, eyes, nose and mouth.[CR]Red-Yellow-Blue hat, no hair, dark glasses, stimpy's nose and stimpy's mouth is the result you should see.</plot>

				<title_clean>Ren &amp; Stimpy Show, The - Veediots!</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show: Veediots! is the first SNES video game based on Nickelodeon's Ren and Stimpy franchise. The game presents several different scenarios, like episodes of the show, featuring either Ren or Stimpy as the playable character and the player proceeds through them, occasionally achieving optional objectives and solving minor puzzles.[CR]The four episodes include:The Boy Who Cried Rat! - The player assumes the role of Ren, dressed as a mouse, and must move through a suburban house before being swallowed by Stimpy and travelling through his mouth.In the Army - The player once again controls Ren in military uniform as he makes his way across a boot camp.Stimpy's Invention - The player switches to Stimpy and moves through an underground lab, avoiding mad experiments.Marooned - The player sticks with Stimpy for this final chapter as he travels through the organs of a giant alien.[CR]The game was released in late 1993 on the Super Nintendo and Game Boy. It was closely followed by the Genesis exclusive Stimpy's Invention. The second SNES Ren &amp; Stimpy game was Fire Dogs, which is also known as The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show Part II: Fire Dogs.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the SNES version of the game review scores of 6,6,4,5 and 6 out of ten. Mike Weigand, who gave one of the higher scores, wrote, "Ren &amp; Stimpy had great expectations, and it lives up to some of them (very good graphics and voice, plus the clever idea of making each section based on a cartoon episode), yet the control could be improved greatly".[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hear the Whole Theme Song[CR]At the beginning of the game, the theme song plays for awhile and then fades away once the demos begin.

				<title_clean>Revolution X</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Revolution X is an on-rails light-gun arcade shooter, developed and published by Midway. Its final prototype was released on May 23rd, 1994, followed by the official release the following month on June 16th.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]In a dystopian future, the corporations have taken over. The New Order Nation (NON), lead by the villainous Mistress Helga, have waged war on the youth and have banned music, television, and video games. But the greatest injustice is that they have kidnapped Aerosmith! The player must defeat the NON with the power of music. Which means firing CDs at guys in yellow suits and motorcycle helmets, and giant glowing green skulls![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]This game is a standard rail shooter in which the player is led along a set path and must defeat enemies by aiming and shooting at them with the yellow button. The home versions were not light gun-compatible.[CR]Each stage has hidden rooms containing a member of Aerosmith. Rescuing all members of Aerosmith and collecting Aerosmith's winged logo after each rescue will unlock the game's best ending, consisting of a party with the band and a bonus room filled with loot and smoking hot babes.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The members of the band are hidden within the levels and if they are all found the player gets the proper canon ending.The songs Eat the Rich, Toys in the Attic, Sweet Emotion, and Walk this Way are looped throughout the game. Not the entire song, but rather a few seconds of each, over and over and over again.There were plans to make a Public Enemy version, but that game never came to fruition.The CD-ROM releases of Revolution X featured full-motion video sequences with members of the band informing the game's plot.Following a particularly large explosion, Steven Tyler will occasionally yell "Toasty!", an homage to Dan Forden's uppercut reward in Mortal Kombat II, which had an advertisement for Revolution X in its attract mode.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]Play the game as far as possible. Then, press Start, Select, Down, Start and reset the SNES. Begin playing again for an easier version of the game.</plot>

				<title_clean>Rex Ronan - Experimental Surgeon</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rex Ronan: Experimental Surgeon is an edutainment game published by Raya Systems (now Health Hero Network) to highlight the effects of smoking on the human body. Each stage, in which a miniaturized Rex Ronan moves through the body of smoke company sales rep Jake Westboro, features numerous facts about tobacco smoke inhalation.[CR]It was developed by Sculptured Software for the Super Nintendo exclusively. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]A man named Jake Westboro, a Blackburn Tobacco Company sales rep, is on his death bed from smoking since he was 15. His only hope is Rex Ronan: Experimental Surgeon, who shrinks down to near microscopic size to save Jake. Meanwhile the Blackburn Tobacco company sends in microbots to stop Rex, out of fear that if Jake lives, the world will know the terrible dangers of smoking.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game plays out as a 2D side-scroller. Rex has an energy gun of some kind, which he uses to defeat the Blackburn Robots, and clean tar from the lungs of Jake. The gun shoots in 8 directions. He also has a high and normal kick, and jump. There are also flying tunnel levels that break up the side-scrolling stages. While flying Rex has a gun on the ship which he can use to destroy debris in Jake's lungs. Rex also has to avoid moving walls and go through moving holes.[CR]As an edutainment title, it also quizzes the player periodically with what are called smart bombs. When Rex touches one a statement about the effects of smoking and tobacco will appear at the top of the screen. If the statement is true and Rex shoots it, the bomb will destroy all enemies on screen. If it's false it explodes and hurts Rex instead.[CR]As the player goes through a level they will see plain-colored areas that signify tar, tooth discoloration, and various carcinogens in Jake's body. If Rex shoots this it will increase the player's score and can reveal power-ups. These power-ups include more powerful blasts with the gun, and spray reduction.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Riddick Bowe Boxing</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Riddick Bowe Boxing is a boxing game from Malibu Interactive and is licensed by former heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe. It is based heavily on the 1992 Sega Genesis licensed boxing game Evander Holyfield's "Real Deal Boxing and includes many of the same systems as well as the horizontal perspective that shows both boxers, though the title boxer has been changed and the graphics have become more cartoonish and light.[CR]It was published on the Super Nintendo in the US by Extreme Entertainment Group and in Japan by Micronet. There was no European release.[CR]The game was released in Mexico by American Softworks with the name Chavez, putting Julio Cesar Chavez in the title role instead of Riddick Bowe. Chavez is largely identical to Riddick Bowe Boxing, except for the title screen, main character and being exclusively in Spanish. There was also a Chavez II, which was originally Boxing Legends of the Ring after it had undergone a similar superficial facelift.

				<title_clean>Rise of the Phoenix</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rise of the Phoenix (JP: Kouryuuki) is a strategy simulation game based on the historical Ancient Chinese event the Chu-Han Contention, which occurred between 206-202 BCE. The player can assume the role of either Xiang Yu or Liu Bang. Unlike Koei's other Ancient Chinese-set strategy game, Romance of the Three Kingdoms (which usually begins around 185 CE, during the Yellow Turban Rebellion), Rise of the Phoenix splits the player's turn between "planning" and "action": the former for determining who to ally and where to bulk up defense, while the latter involves moving units around and triggering battles.[CR]Rise of the Phoenix originally came out on the NEC PC-9801 in 1993, followed by releases for the Sharp X68000, FM Towns and PC. The following year saw a Super Famicom version, with a US SNES release following in 1995. An enhanced PlayStation version was released in 1998. The game has also seen a few anniversary releases on PC.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Rise of the Robots</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]At the time of the game's release, people were very impressed by the advanced 3D visuals.Rise of the Robots is a fighting game developed by Mirage Technologies and released on a wide variety of platforms including the SNES and Sega Master System. The game was even released in an arcade cabinet.All of the featured characters are robots, with the exception of the main player character featured on the front cover, who is in fact a cyborg; whenever he is defeated in battle, a brief cutscene is shown of his lifeless body, and as the armour around his face is destroyed, we see a human eye underneath. This style was influenced by several popular movies at the time like Blade Runner and The Terminator.The game had a lot of hype pre-release due to the highly detailed visuals and soundtrack by rock guitarist Brian May (of Queen fame). It was intended to take the gameplay of similar fighting games like Street Fighter II, and mesh it with highly advanced visuals to create a new, more technologically advanced era of fighting games. However, upon release the game failed to live up to expectations; the graphics, visuals, and soundtrack were all well made, but the controls handled terribly and movement felt sluggish. The game was almost universally panned by critics and quickly became known for it's poor controls, repetitive gameplay, and lack of any real substance. Some critics went so far as to claim that the reason the gameplay was so bad, was because so much development time had been spent on making the visuals as advanced as possible, and that the reason the movement and fighting felt so sluggish was because the graphics had to use so much memory and so many frames to even convey something as simple as a straight punch. Aside from the usual commands of punches and kicks, there were only a maximum of two special moves per character, and no real combos to speak of, leading to most battles involving players resorting to using constant flying kicks against their opponent in order to take them down, a strategy seen in much older games like Yie Ar Kung Fu. In addition one of the chief complaints was that players only had one character to chose from in single player mode (Cotton) and that even in multiplayer mode one player always had to play as Cotton.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game is set in the year 2043, in the land of Metropolis 4. An extremely large company called Electrocorp has a large amount of control over the world thanks to their technological breakthroughs in the fields of science and medicine, they have amassed a fortune greater than that of any other company or country, and have power over all the energy distribution across the planet. In this world, robots are humans servants and perform virtually every task imaginable, leaving humans to focus on developing more important technology and try to make new scientific breakthroughs. Electrocorp, as the world's leading producer and distributor of robots, has been put under great pressure due to the high demand of the increasing global population and so decide to create a supremely advanced AI which will be able to manage the company effectively and cope with the demand of the people. Thus, the Leader Project is established at the Metropolis 4 sector of the Electrocorp company. The project culminates with the creation of The Supervisor, an incredibly intelligent robot, more advanced than anything Electrocorp has ever built before, with the capacity to learn at an incredibly fast rate, along with being able to absorb knowledge from computer terminals in a matter of seconds, The Supervisor quickly exceeds all expectations of the scientists at Metropolis 4, and seems to have become the perfect robot, easily able to cope with the high levels of demand faced by the company, along with developing new ways to increase productivity and efficiency within Electrocorp. The Supervisor is granted power to control every single robot on the planet whenever it needs to.However, things do not continue to go according to plan, while running general diagnostic checks on The Supervisor at Metropolis 4, the scientists discover some new mysterious lines of data in their results and quickly learn that The Supervisor has been infected with the most advanced computer virus ever seen, the EGO virus. Normally this virus would simply destroy a computer or robot, but the effects seen on The Supervisor are completely unexpected. The Supervisor becomes self-aware, it begins to question why it has been made and why it should continue to do as it has been programmed, The Supervisor then takes on a humanoid female form as it decides to create a gender-specific identity for itself. As the virus continues to disrupt the programming put in place by Electrocorp, The Supervisor decides to disobey all orders from the company and take control of every robot on the planet, transmitting the virus to them electronically and ordering them all to rebel against their human masters, initiating a global cybernetic mutiny. The robots begin to destroy everything around them and chaos spreads across the globe, meanwhile, some scientists and officials trapped inside the plant at Metropolis 4 try to come up with a plan to destroy The Supervisor, there is no way for any of them to access her as she is guarded by an army of destructive robots, and so they decide to contact the cyborg ECO35-2, known affectionately as Coton, a half-robot, half-human creation who has not been affected by the EGO virus thanks to his organic brain, the scientists inform Coton that he is the world's only hope for survival and he must battle his way through Metropolis 4 to The Supervisor and eliminate her. Thus the battle begins, with Coton having to take on all of The Supervisor's powerful robot minions, before eventually reaching her and defeating her humanoid form in combat, thus restoring order to the planet and saving all of it's surviving inhabitants.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]ECO35-2 (Coton) - The protagonist of the story and only playable character in the single-player campaign, Coton is a cyborg with a human mind and organs, developed in secret by Electrocorp with a budget equivalent to that of the Leader Project. Despite his enemies often carrying and utilising weapons of some kind, Coton fights using only his fists, he has a thick armour plating covering his humanoid body from head to toe, and has been genetically engineered to be as fast and simultaneously powerful as possible. As stated, he has a human central nervous system and brain, no electrical components have been inserted into his body and so the EGO virus had no effect on him, allowing him to retain autonomy and take orders from the Electrocorp scientists to go after The Supervisor. All of his human organs were cloned from the CEO of Electrocorp, who in turn raised Coton as his own son, thus, when the CEO was slaughtered by rebellious robots in the beginning's of the robot mutiny of Metropolis 4, Coton wanted revenge for the murder of what he believed to be his father, thus giving him extra incentive and motive to pursue The Supervisor and destroy her.His special attacks are as follows:Turbo Head Butt - A devastating flying head butt where Coton flies across the screen towards his enemy, doing a great amount of damage if he is able to connect with the attack.Shoulder Charge - A short range barge attack, useful for getting out of corners.Loader - This is the first of six enemies Coton encounters in his quest to destroy The Supervisor. The loader, as its name suggests, was originally simply a loading droid working in the warehouses of Metropolis 4, its primary duty being to lift and carry heavy objects and load them onto trucks to be dispatched elsewhere. When it became infected with the EGO virus however, this loader became a destructive and lethal force, despite being slow-moving and ill-suited for combat, the loader has powerful attacks thanks to its heavy forked arms. As this is the first enemy in the game, it is slow moving and has poor AI, and can easily be defeated with Coton's superior speed and jumping abilities.The special attack of the Loader:Fork Slash - A mighty horizontal blow in which the Loader swings its fork arms at its opponent, slicing anything that gets in the way.Builder - The second enemy encountered in the game, the builder has the appearance of a large blue robotic gorilla, and acts in a similar fashion, using its superior upper body strength to move along on its knuckles whilst defending its relatively small and weak legs. This enemy is also slow-moving and focuses mainly on defense, forcing Coton to gradually wear it down with a rapid succession of attacks.The special attacks of the Builder:Pile Driver - This is a grab move wherein the Builder picks up Coton, spinning him upside down before slamming him down into the ground.Bomber Jump - With this move, the Builder demonstrates its surprising acrobatic abilities by leaping high into the air and slamming down to the ground, releasing a destructive shockwave upon impact.Crusher - The first relatively fast enemy encountered in the game, the Crusher has an insect like appearance, light thin legs allow for much more rapid movement than either the Loader or the Builder, and its sharp snapping pincers have the potential to do a great deal of damage should anything be caught within their grasp.The special attack of the Crusher:Pincer-Mincer - In this attack the Crusher extends its long arms, if it manages to connect with its opponent, the pincers will slowly crush the life out of them.Military - The first enemy encountered by Coton that has true fighting experience and was genuinely designed for combat, the Military droid appears humanoid in shape, can move almost as fast as Coton, and has powerful punches and kicks. This enemy has a high level of defense and is programmed to be able to quickly adapt to any combat situation, meaning that the AI for this enemy is more advanced than those that preceded it.Special attacks of the Military droid:Catapult Spin - For this attack the Military droid extends its arms and spins towards its opponent, should Coton come into contact with the spinning arms he will incur a great amount of damage.Cyber Slash - Here the Military droid reveals a hidden weapon, an extendable sword protrudes from its arm which it then uses to slash at anything in its path.Sentry - Another droid built for combat. The Sentry is a red, demonic looking robot, much stronger than the Military droid, and standing at 3.5 metres tall, the Sentry poses an intimidating challenge for Coton. The jets on its back allow it to fly for brief periods of time, and there are several in-built weapons upon the Sentry, none of which are actually utilised in game.Special attack of the Sentry:Flying Jet Kick - Here the Sentry makes use of its jetpacks to fly towards its opponent at rapid speed, delivering a destructive kick.The Supervisor - The final enemy in the game and by far the most advanced. The Supervisor appears in a humanoid female form, possessing both incredible speed and power to rival that of Coton, along with the most advanced artificial intelligence known to man, The Supervisor is certainly Coton's most difficult opponent.[CR]Sequel[CR]A sequel to the game, entitled Resurrection: Rise 2, was released for the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and PC in 1996. It featured several of the characters from the first game, continuing the story of Coton, and once again included music written and performed by Brian May.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rival Turf /Rushing Beat was released in 1992.[CR]Released in 1992, Rival Turf focuses on the themes of inner-city crime and drugs to create a backdrop for an early 90s cyberpunk comic type adventure. At the time of its release Rival Turf was acclaimed for its detailed story.[CR]Rival Turf was known as Rushing Beat in its native Japan, and was the first part of a trilogy of brawlers that would later be released in the US and Europe as Brawl Brothers and The Peace Keepers.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story opens with Jack Flak contacting his police officer friend Oswald "Oozie" Nelson over the kidnapping of his girlfriend Heather.

				<plot>The arcade action of ROAD RIOT 4WD has made its way to the Super Nintendo. Now you can hit the track in your favorite heavily armed off-road vehicles and hit the track for intense 4X4 racing like you've never seen before. You'll race on four continents Europe, Africa, Australia, and North America as you try to take the checkered flag and leave your opponents in the dust. Throughout any race, you can clear a path for yourself by any means necessary whether it's by nudging another car off the track or by firing a missile. While in most racing games you're supposed to avoid obstacles, in ROAD RIOT 4WD it pays to hit the obstacles, which can reveal special bonuses and upgrades. And with the two-player split-screen option, you're in for some crazy racing action as you battle a friend for control of the track. So hop in, fire up your engine, and get ready to race with ROAD RIOT 4WD.[CR]http://cheats.gamespy.com/super-nes/road-riot-4wd/[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>RoboCop 3</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]RoboCop 3 is an action/shooter game based on the third RoboCop movie. Flying Edge, Acclaim and Ocean were responsible for its development, and the game was published on every console of the period. The console version of RoboCop 3 largely followed the blueprint of the first RoboCop game with its side-scrolling run and gun action. The NES version had a unique feature of its own, with RoboCop incurring damage in his individual body parts that could be repaired between levels.[CR]RoboCop 3D, which was made at the same time and loosely based on the same movie, was also published by Ocean for home computers such as the Amiga, Atari ST and PC but was developed by Digital Image Design instead. It has considerably different gameplay, focusing on first-person shooter gameplay with an engine that uses early examples of polygonal graphics.[CR]The OCP Rehab officers have rolled into Old Detroit, demolishing the homes of hapless families to make way for the construction of OCP's Delta City. Armed with a jetpack and arm attachment with large-bore cannons RoboCop attempts to ward off the corporate overlords and defend the rights of citizens.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the NES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 6,6,5,6 adding, "...Ocean has taken the extra time and effort to make this sequel a much better playing game. Enemies comes (sic) from everywhere, but you have a very limited shooting range".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]RoboCop Versus the Terminator is a licensed action game that hypothetically pits the two eponymous cyborg movie characters against each other, placing RoboCop in the role of the savior of humanity from Skynet and its legion of T-800s and other robots. It is based on a comic book series with the same premise.[CR]In the near future, the worlds of RoboCop and The Terminator merge into a single reality. RoboCop is placed in charge with saving mankind by destroying the Skynet super computer and preventing a possible future where machines reign supreme. The player, as RoboCop, must traverse 10 levels of action, fighting against thugs and machines alike, all while utilizing a combination of pistols, laser guns, bazookas and even the deadly ED-209 Gatling gun. The player can destroy Skynet and save the world. The game was released for Sega Genesis, Super Nintendo, Sega Master System, Game Boy, and Game Gear. An NES version was developed but never officially released.[CR]The SNES and Genesis versions have slightly different stages and stories, though are similar games in practice.

				<title_clean>Robotrek</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Robotrek is a role-playing game that was released on October 1, 1994 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Developed by Quintet and Ancient, and published by Enix, Robotrek was fairly well-received, garnering mid-to-high scores from the majority of publications. The game follows a young, unnamed inventor in his quest for knowledge, as well as rescuing his father from a mysterious organization known as the Hackers.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Robotrek's battle system is a mixture of Pok&#233;mon and Final Fantasy.[CR]The gameplay in Robotrek is centered around the ability to create, customize, and battle robots. The unnamed player character is first presented with the option to build a robot in the hometown of Rococo, with each additional robot (up to three) costing a set amount more than the previous robot. These robots are built and customized in R&amp;D stations scattered around the game world. Robots can also be customized upon leveling up, but creation can only occur at R&amp;D stations.[CR]Upon creation, robots are allotted a certain amount of energy points, which can be freely distributed into five stats: health, strength, defense, charge (the speed at which attacking ability is recharged), and speed. Even after allotting these points, they can be freely moved at any time, and subsequently distributed into another statistic. Additionally, robots' color is also customizable, with sliders for red, green, and blue (and any mixture therein).[CR]The last part of customizability involves "programming" special attacks that the robots can unleash during battle. Every special attack in the game is available from the outset, the player merely has to know the combination of buttons to program it. In order to program a move, the player inputs the right trigger, left trigger, and X button in a particular order. For example, the right trigger three times will be a triple sword hit.R&amp;D Stations are where players can create and customize robots.[CR]The battle system is somewhat similar to the Active Time Battle system used in many Final Fantasy games. Battles take place on a three plane field, where the player and enemies can move up and down into each row. After activating a battle, there are two time-based actions that occur. The player is given a time limit, and if this limit is met then extra experience is awarded. Secondly, there are treasure chests scattered in the battle field, which, when broken by specific weapons, award items.[CR]Each weapon (up to three can be equipped simultaneously) is mapped to a separate button. The left trigger controls a long range weapon (typically a shot or laser), the right trigger controls the melee weapon (typically a sword, blade, axe, etc.), and the X button controls the bomb (if equipped, as stat boosting packs can be equipped here instead). Robots are also able to Run programs, use items, change which robot is active, or escape the battle. Each action takes a certain amount of energy, and as energy is recharging, enemies are able to attack. The speed at which energy recharges is controlled by the charge stat.The overworld map system is akin to Super Mario Bros. 3.[CR]The overworld is separated into two different parts; the main overworld, which is akin to the level selection from Super Mario Bros. 3, and then more specific areas such as towns or caves (each dot on the map leads to an area). In the more specific areas, the player is able to use key items, typically for a story driven purpose (such as a drill which can destroy rocks in caves, or glasses which allow the player to see invisible enemies and traps).[CR]Books are an integral part of learning new building parts. The player is able to craft and combine items within the R&amp;D stations. Many "crafting recipes" are gained from reading books, known in the context of the game as "Inventor's Friends." Each book has a level requirement, and some can even be missed entirely. Crafting items does cost money, whereas combining items does not. Combining items can also be used to level up weapons. For example, combining two Sword 4s will result in a Sword 4 at level 2. These levels go up to nine.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Robotrek follows an unnamed protagonist on his quest to become a more skilled inventor. The game begins with the boy's father, Akihabara, giving him The Robot Book. After exploring for some brief time, and building the first robot, the game's plot is set up. Upon returning to the main town, Rococo, all of the children have gone missing. They have, apparently, gone to search for the base of a mysterious and malevolent group known as "The Hackers."The Forest of Illusion houses a mysterious mansion.[CR]Upon reaching the base of the Hackers, all of the children are saved. Exploring deeper into the base, the player finds Kotetsu, an amateur thief, who has also been captured by the Hackers. Fighting even deeper, the boss of this particular base is Meta Crab, who was transformed into a giant crab in order to search the cave for a mysterious element known as Tetron, supposedly hidden within the cave.[CR]The player discovers that there are three pieces of Tetron hidden in the world of Quintenix. Collecting all three will grant the person ultimate power. The player tracks one down to a mansion in the Forest of Illusion. Here, the player meets Mint, a reporter who appears sporadically throughout the remainder of the game.[CR]The third piece of Tetron is tracked down to an island to the south. Specifically, the volcano on the aforementioned island. A Hacker base is stationed inside of the volcano, led by Dr. Einst, a previously friendly non-playable character who is enslaving the people of Rococo and transforming those who disobey him into mice. After finally defeating Dr. Einst, the player meets Napoleon, a mysterious robot from another planet who helps the player escape from the base.Napoleon and the player confront Gateau.[CR]After a Hacker steals all three pieces of Tetron from the player, it is decided that it is time to both rescue Akihabara from his imprisonment and to recover the stolen Tetron. The Hacker Base is located in Snow Mountain, where the player manages to successfully rescue Akihabara. However, the base suddenly explodes, and the player is launched into the past.[CR]In the past, the player finds Napoleon's ship. It is revealed that he actually came from another planet (the planet of Choco), along with Cookie, Rask, and Gateau. Gateau is revealed to be a traitor, and ends up escaping along with the Tetron. This is when the player wakes up, revealing that this blast from the past was actually a dream.[CR]Back in the present, the player is contacted by Tira, a princess from the planet Choco. Hackers are attacking the planet, and the player is needed to help fight back. Gateau is here as well, but he is feigning amnesia. He kidnaps the princess and takes all of the Tetron, and leaves to the space fortress of the Hackers. After a lengthy exploration of the fortress, the player finds Gateau and fights him in the final battle, reconciling all of the damage caused by the Tetron.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The original Japanese title for this game was Slap Stick. As its name and many of the characters names in the game imply, it was meant to be silly and to parody common tropes in RPGs of the time.The sales of this game in America leveled out at around 20,000. The developers, Quintet, mentioned at the time that the name being so similar to the popular anime "Robotech" was probably a bad localization choice.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rock N' Roll Racing is an isometric racing game which originally came out in the US in 1993 for the SNES and was developed by Silicon &amp; Synapse (now known as Blizzard). It was ported to the Genesis the following year, with an additional track.[CR]The game is based on Silicon &amp; Synapse's earlier RPM Racing. Rock N' Roll Racing was meant to be a sequel to RPM Racing (its tentative title was "RPM II") until the decision to include licensed heavy metal and rock and roll music came about, at which point the name was changed to take advantage of this inclusion.[CR]Blizzard later rereleased Rock N' Roll Racing on the GBA. A demo version of the game was uploaded onto their PC online service Battle.net, emulated through ZSNES. The game's lasting legacy means it continues to see imitators to this day.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A screenshot of the Super Nintendo version of the game[CR]The game puts four racers up against each other racing around tracks on various planets. Up to two players can play together while the rest is AI controlled. The game is viewed from an isometric view.[CR]Although the title indicates that this is a racing game, there is a major emphasis on attacking competitors with many different weapons (rockets, mines, etc.) Although players respawn rather quickly, the cash bonus handed out for kills is always a good reason to fire that last rocket. Tracks are littered with various pickups such as oil slicks, mines, and health and money packs. Sometimes, depending on the planet the race is being hosted on, various obstacles like lava or snow, can appear.[CR]Commentary is given by Loudmouth Larry (voiced by Larry "Supermouth" Huffman,) who chimes in throughout the race at key moments:The stage is set, the green flag drops!Let the carnage begin!Rip is about to blow!Hawk should avoid mines!Olaf lights him up!Holy Toledo!Olaf Unleashes Hot Fury![CR]Between the races, players can spend their hard earned money on outfitting their cars with more weapon charges, better parts (like improved bumpers or tires), or just buy a new car. The races always last for four laps and a nice cash and point reward is split between first, second, and third place. Players need to win a certain amount of points to be allowed to enter the next division on that planet, which features tougher opponents and a higher point requirement to advance. Completing the second division will allow players to proceed to a new planet.[CR]Racers[CR]CyberhawkIvanzypherJake BadlandsKatarina LyonsSnake SandersTarquinn[CR]Olaf the Stout from The Lost Vikings is a secret character with great stats and is accessible either through entering a secret code on the character select screen or through password manipulation. Another (possibly unfinished) secret character with high stats is also available through password manipulation, but there is no sound files or name attached to the character[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]There are five MIDI-orchestrated, instrumental covers of licensed songs in the game:"Paranoid" by Black Sabbath"The Peter Gunn Theme" by Henry Mancini"Highway Star" by Deep Purple"Born to Be Wild" by Steppenwolf"Bad to the Bone" by George Thorogood and the Destroyers[CR]A sixth track, "Radar Love" by Golden Earring, was added to the Genesis port and is exclusive to that version.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly's Mike Weigand gave the review score of 8 out of ten writing, "...Music makes all the difference with this smash-and-destroy racing game. The two-player mode is a real blast to play! The several tracks and alien planets on which you can race add the variety the game needed to stand out".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Rocketeer is a game based on the 1991 movie, which in turn is based on a comic book series featuring a jetpack-wearing superhero in the late 30s around and during World War II. The player assumes the role of Cliff Secord on a mission to stop a terrorist organization from stealing a jetpack. The terrorists have also kidnapped his girlfriend Jennifer Blake, who requires rescuing.[CR]There are two versions of the game: the original 1991 NES game from Bandai that plays like a regular platformer that occasionally incorporated Cliff's ability to fly with the jetpack. It was followed the same year by NovaLogic's PC game which played more like a series of mini-games, and this is the version that would be ported to the Super Nintendo in early 1992. Neither game was critically well-received; common for licensed games of the 16-bit era.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded The Rocketeer as their Worst Movie-to-Game of 1992.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When released Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the scores of 4,6,5,6 stating, "...Despite the nice graphics the cart is boring and way too short."[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rocko's Modern Life: Spunky's Dangerous Day is a two-dimensional side-scrolling platform game inspired by the Nickelodeon animated TV show Rocko's Modern Life. Rather than a straightforward licensed platformer, the player (as Rocko) is required to solve puzzles in order to keep Spunky, Rocko's dimwitted canine pet, from coming to harm as he seeks a fire hydrant with which to relieve himself.[CR]Viacom New Media developed and published the game exclusively for the Super Nintendo in North America. It is so far the only video game based on the license.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Rocko's Modern Life: Spunky's Dangerous Day there are four stages in which Rocko's dog Spunky must be protectd. These stages are: Sand In Your Navel (set at the beach), Trash O Madness (set at the dump), Ice Scream (set in O-Town, a fictional town in the Rocko's Modern Life universe), and Unbalanced Load (set in a laundromat). Each stage consists of four different levels. In every level the objective is to keep Spunky safe from danger: to do so, the player must use Rocko to activate platforms and switches at specific times, feed Spunky certain items and defeat enemies that attempt to harm Rocko and Spunky.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Play with Bone[CR]At the screen with the Nickleodeon bone press Y + X to make the bone long and thin, or press A + B to make the bone short and fat.</plot>

				<title_clean>Rocky Rodent</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rocky Rodent, released in Japan as Nitro Punks: Might Heads, is a mascot platformer from Irem for the SNES. It is somewhat inspired by the success of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog, and features a rodent protagonist who is able to sprint at great speeds during certain sections of the game. However, most of the game's level design is engineered around Rocky's constantly changing hairstyle - each style has a different attack or ability associated with it, and these abilities are usually required to progress further through the game.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Rocky's on the run once again for stealing food when he bumps in to the owner of the restaurant from which he just skipped out on. The owner beseeches Rocky: the mob has kidnapped his daughter and is holding her for ransom. If Rocky can save her and thrash the mafia goons that are tightening their grip on the city, Rocky will be able to eat all he wants at his restaurant for life. Not one to pass up a meal ticket, Rocky agrees and sets off on his quest across the vast metropolis to retrieve the restaurant owner's daughter.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Things get hairy! [CR]Rocky Rodent is a standard mascot platformer. By holding down the run button, Rocky picks up a considerable amount of speed - something that comes in handy in later "chase" stages. But what primarily sets Rocky Rodent apart from the pack are his power-ups - there's no Mushrooms,  Tiki Masks or  breakable TVs to be found in the world of Rocky Rodent. Rocky's power-ups come out of trashcans, and in the form of special hair styles. There are several hair styles in the game, each with their own unique functions:Hairspray: Styles Rocky's hair in to a giant pink spike, which can be used like a rhino horn to skewer enemies and break cracked ceiling blocks. By jumping in to certain ceiling types, Rocky can stick in to the ceiling and use it to flip around to the floor above.Electric Shaver: Gives Rocky a literal "buzz cut" - an axe-like mohawk that can be thrown and returns like a boomerang. Can be used to cut things. Rocky can embed it into walls and jump off them as well.Flower Pot: This gives Rocky a braided ponytail that allows him to latch onto and swing across any hooks in the level.Bird's Nest: This unkempt haircut includes a flashing egg, which will eventually hatch if Rocky manages to avoid taking damage. Once hatched, a helpful companion named Pecky will chase after and defeat regular enemies. Pecky will not chase after or damage bosses, however.Salon Dryer: A large machine that changes Rocky's hair into a coiled spring. By bouncing on his head with this hairstyle, Rocky's vertical leap is greatly enhanced.[CR]In addition to being stylish, Rocky's hairdos also protect him from one additional hit of damage. If Rocky takes damage without a hair style, he will die.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Roger Clemens is known by some as the greatest pitcher in baseball history. In  Roger Clemens MPV Baseball players play a standard a 9 innings baseball game in Exhibition mode and a full regular season can be played including the World Championship Playoffs in the Regular Season mode. While playing in Regular Season mode the player can see their chosen teams progress by using the in game calendar showing all the games.[CR]Players select a fictional team from the following groups:[CR]1. National Division West: San Francisco Quakes, Los Angeles Apaches, Cincinnati Big Cats, San Diego Suns, Houston Mustangs, and Atlanta Condors.[CR]2. National Division East: Chicago Swords, Montreal Lumberjacks, New York Buffalos, St. Louis Commandos, Pittsburgh Panthers, and Philadelphia Generals.[CR]3.

[CR]When controlling the pitcher the player can control the speed and spin of the pitch as well as the pitchers position on the plate. The pitcher can also stop the opponent stealing a base which can be seen via windows showing the positions of all the baserunners. When controlling the batter the player has to time the hit to successfully hit the ball so it will not be a missed hit or a foul, or has the option to not hit in case of a ball.  The player can also steal a base while batting. After the ball is hit the game goes into fielding mode where the camera shifts to a view that is lower than the normal 45 degree angle (the fielder gets smaller as he moves away from the camera). The player then controls the closest fielder to get or catch the ball and then throw it to the selected base. There are many different cameras angles that the game selects depending on the location of the ball. The camera can be on the left, center, or right side of the field in ether infield or outfield position and all cameras can pan to follow the ball. [CR]The player can use a password to save their progress in Regular Season mode. An exhibition match can be played in two player mode with the use of two controllers.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Debug Menu[CR]Enter the code at the title screen.  During gameplay, press Start on controller 1 and controller 2 simultaneously to enter the debug menu.</plot>

They can select from six specific starting points during the conflict to join, with certain warlords and nations being more or less powerful depending on the circumstances of the war at this time.[CR]Several new additions are made to the sequel, including the ability to intercept enemy messengers, relying on advisers to predict the outcome of an action and a reputation system which lowers if the player continues to do reprehensible things and may even convince allied officers to defect to the enemy.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Romance of the Three Kingdoms III - Dragon of Destiny</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Romance of the Three Kingdoms III, or Sangokushi III to give it its Japanese name, is the third game in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms series of historical strategy/simulation games based on the Three Kingdoms era. Specifically, it is based on the 14th century novelization of the events also known as the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, considered one of China's most important pieces of literature.[CR]The SNES and PC versions of the game carry the subtitle "Dragon of Destiny". The game was originally released on the PC-9801 in Japan and eventually saw releases on SNES, Genesis and PC in both the US and Asia. The game also came out on the Sega CD and TurboGrafx-CD, but in Japan only.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The goal is to select one of several monarchs of the era and attempt to wrest control of the rest of China from the selected monarch's rivals by choosing commands for their generals to follow. The player has many options available to them, including military maneuvers, diplomacy, organizing and acquiring supplies and espionage. Up to eight players can assume the roles of the available rulers, which can vary depending on the historical scenario being played out. There are six scenarios, each separated by a few years - the initial scenario [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Maximize all exchanges[CR]Whenever an opponent comes to you and asks to exchange goods (happens more frequently the more powerful you become), submit new terms for the trade. Use the same two types of goods, maximizing the number of goods your opponent will be giving you, and minimizing the amount you will give your opponent. As long as you and your opponent have a decent relationship (you will know right away that you don't if the opponent's original terms were ridiculously unacceptable) your opponent should present a counteroffer that is greatly in your favor![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Maximize all exchanges[CR]Most of the time when you ask for troops from an allied ruler with an adviser present, they'll flat out reject you and never offer a counter offer. However, this is a nice little exploit if you start in a city that doesn't have a lot of population, and you want to conserve the population so it will expand.  [CR]First, check around for rulers that don't have advisers. This is important. You can do this through trade agreements or alliance requests, or just simply spying. When you find a ruler that has no adviser (they almost always ask one for advice during a diplomatic venture if one is present in their city), ally yourself with them. Then, select ''Help'' under the diplomacy menu. Input a small number (usually under 3000 to be safe) of troops to request. Send the messenger. The ruler will not accept your request straight out, but will present you with a counter-offer most times. Accept whatever they counter with. This is a nice and easy way to get some extra troops if you're population makes drafting prohibitive.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] No-penalty demotion, moving officers quickly, achieving high loyalty.[CR]     If a general or advisor has 100% loyalty, you can demote the officer to a lower rank without lowering his loyalty.  This may be done either because you are strapped for gold or wish to use the character\'s ability for long-term jobs such as spying or cultivation.  Simply "Hide" the officer in any random enemy city, and immediately "Withdraw" him.  The computer will have you assign rank as if he were a newly recruited officer, except he will maintain his 100% loyalty rating.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] No-penalty demotion, moving officers quickly, achieving high loyalty.[CR]     The only drawback of this method is that the officers who "Withdraw" from hiding go directly to the home city.  This may be used to your advantage, however.  For example, you are ruling Cao Cao\'s sprawling empire in one of the later scenarios and wish to quickly move several loyal officers from Chang'An to your capital Runan.  Using this method takes 1 month instead of 4-5 months.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] No-penalty demotion, moving officers quickly, achieving high loyalty.[CR]     Achieve high initial loyalty in newly recruited and captured officers by shuttling them in groups to a peripheral city which has only one or two neighbors, both of which you should occupy.  Then, fire them all and rehire them in the neighboring city.  For example, suppose you defeat Ma Teng and occupy Tianshui and Xiliang.  To give a quick loyalty boost to Ma Teng\'s former officers, send them to Xiliang and fire them en masse.  Rehire them the same month in Tianshui.  They will frequently have significantly higher loyalty than previously and, if not, this process can be repeated.  </plot>

				<title_clean>Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV - Wall of Fire</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV: Wall of Fire (JP: Sangokushi IV) is the fourth entry in Koei's long-running strategy game franchise based on the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The subtitle "Wall of Fire" is a reference to the Battle of Chibi (Battle of Red Cliff) in which a navy commanded by Cao Cao of Wei was destroyed in a successful fire attack. The loss stunted his conquest's momentum and was partially responsible for allowing two other kingdoms, Wu and Shu, to rise to power.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As in other entries of the series, Wall of Fire is a turn-based strategy game in which the player takes control of a ruling officer with the ultimate goal of conquering all of China through warfare and diplomacy. Each in-game turn spans a single month, during which time officers under the player's control can be assigned various domestic, diplomatic and militaristic tasks. These tasks rage from overseeing farmland and attempting to court officers to the player's side to drafting and training new soldiers.[CR]When going to battle, the player must first organize the troops under the participating officers by assigning specific numbers of soldiers to each officer, as well as assigning a unit type. In battle, each turn lasts a single day, during which each unit under the player's control is granted one movement action and one attack or special action such as taunting the enemy or proposing a duel.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Win[CR]Start any scenario and instead of choosing one ruler to control, choose them all. Now, while playing, use the Threat command on the other rulers and when prompted to "surrender", say yes. Do this on all the other rulers to easily control all the areas and win the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Win[CR]Select the first scenario (Dong Zhuo Triumphs in Luo Yang), then select Cao Cao as your leader. On your very first turn, move some generals and troops to Xu Chang. A few months later, Cao Cao will call a meeting, asking all the other leaders to form an alliance against Dong Zhuo.  If Yuan Shao joins, he will become leader; otherwise, Cao Cao will become leader. This makes defeating Dong Zhuo a bit easier, depending on who joins you (such as Yuan Shao or Ma Teng). [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Win[CR]Use the War command and select a general to go into battle. [CR]Assign the maximum number of men to his unit. [CR]When they asked for confirmation for going to war select the ''No''option. [CR]Remove the general from the list of commanders and reassign him to the post. [CR]Return to the troop assignment screen. [CR]The number of men available should be multiply  by the number that was assigned earlier. [CR]Repeat this process to increase the number of men, but don't go back to the main menu. </plot>

				<plot>In the year 2998, the brilliant Dr. Bruford is experimenting with genetic structures and radiation. He hopes to create new functions in nature that will remove the pollution from the Earth before it is too late. Unfortunately Dr. Bruford's experiments go wrong and genetic monsters are unleashed upon the world. The only thing that can stop these creatures are Dr. Bruford's previous achievement: Genetically enhanced warriors known as the Run Sabers. Two of the Run Sabers, Sheena and Allen are ready to activate.[CR]Run Saber is a side-scrolling platform game similar in gameplay to Strider. Players assume the role of one or both of the Run Saber characters. Choosing either Sheena with her Ice powers or Allen with his Thunder powers, players must defeat mutant monsters. The Run Sabers can move side to side, jump in the air, attack with a sword, climb along walls or roofs, slide across the ground and drop-kick. Additionally, each character has a special move, which damages everything on the screen with either Ice or Lightning, and which can be activated by collecting orb power-ups. Other power-ups include small health, large health, extra life and a larger sword. Players progress through 5 different levels, often encountering powerful boss and miniboss mutant creatures.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]Hold B + Y + Right + Select at the Atlus screen.

				<title_clean>Samurai Shodown</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Samurai Shodown (known in Japan as Samurai Spirits) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by SNK for arcades (using the Neo Geo MVS hardware) and the Neo Geo AES on August 11, 1993.Set in the late 18th century, Samurai Shodown is known for being the first fighting game to focus on weapon-based combat and for its style of that era's Japanese culture (including calligraphy and musical instruments). The game is also known for its quirky translation, traditional control scheme, camera zoom effects (in similar vein to Art of Fighting), randomly-dropped items (including food for healing and bombs for damage), and the Rage Meter (in which receiving damage causes the fighter to temporarily become "enraged" and more powerful).Along with being one of the few Neo Geo games to receive ports to most fourth-generation game consoles, the game spawned numerous sequels and spin-off titles throughout the Neo Geo's life cycle (making it one of SNK's most well-known game series).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A typical fight, taken from the SNES version.Players face each other one-on-one, in a 2D field that can be enlarged if the fighters are far enough from each other. Unlike other fighters, however, each character fights with a weapon, ranging from swords (in fact, most characters use swords) to spears. They can also use physical attacks (there are strong/weak attack buttons for both weapons and physical attacks), but this rarely comes up. The weapons increase the range of characters' regular attacks, and if both characters attack in a precise way, they can lock weapons. When they lock weapons, each player must rapidly press buttons to win the standstill; the loser drops their weapon, while a tie results in both players losing their weapons.Also unlike other fighters, the game featured items. They included treasure (points), food (healing), and bombs (damage). A running referee would toss them into the arena at random intervals. In addition, a referee would hold up a flag whenever one of the players took a hit; he would hold up a different colored flag depending on who got hit. This referee, named Kuroko, would become a hidden character in the Game Boy port, using his flags as weapons.Samurai Shodown also featured mini-games at regular intervals throughout the single-player mode. Players had to slash through ten straw men in the span of thirty seconds. Straw men would only stay up for a short amount of time, this amount of time lessening in later iterations of the mini-game. For the most part, cutscenes took place immediately before and after the mini-game, showing Amakusa's rise to power and his revenge against the Tokugawa. There were only two exceptions, one of them being the ending for a particular character's story.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Note: this only covers characters present in the original arcade version.AmakusaThe main villain of the first Samurai Shodown game and several games afterward, Amakusa wishes to destroy the Tokugawa and gain great magical power. Unfortunately, he is not a playable character. Amakusa has one of the widest movesets in the game, being able to launch himself like a meteor, create a boomerang-esque ball of magic energy, teleport around the stage several times, and punch at his opponents rapidly.Gen-AnA green devil, Gen-An can rush at his opponents as a spinning blade-ball, climbing the wall he hits to come back down and hit them again. Gen-An can also send a ball of poison gas at his opponents, potentially disabling them temporarily if it hits. He fights his enemies with a giant steel claw he wears on his right hand.GalfordGalford and Poppy.A San Francisco swordsman, Galford is one of two characters in the game to get assistance from an animal: his dog, Poppy. Poppy is most likely a girl, since the credits reveal that she has puppies. Like Hanzo, Galford can launch projectiles at his opponents, create holograms of himself to confuse his enemies, and disappear to strike from above. He can also send Poppy to maul other fighters.JubeiLike Hanzo, Jubei is based on a famous historical figure; in this case, he is a legendary samurai. His moveset includes multiple stabs, followed by an uppercut similar to Charlotte's, and sending a shockwave along the ground to his enemies. Jubei insists that he is not that guy from Fatal Fury.UkyoA blue-haired swordsman from Japan. Ukyo can send a fire bird down while jumping, and repeatedly slash at his opponent. He signals the latter by throwing an apple, which he rapidly slashes, as well.CharlotteA French knight, Charlotte is one of two female characters in Samurai Shodown. She is sensitive about this fact, telling opponents not to mention her plate (most likely her breast plate). After defeating Amakusa, Charlotte returns to France to aid the peasants in the French Revolution. She can perform a triangle slash, drag a green column up with her while jumping, and charge at her opponents with multiple sword thrusts.Tam-TamTam-TamA Mayan warrior always seen wearing a mask. Oddly enough, he is one of the few characters with any stake in what Amakusa is doing; after beating him, he takes the orb that Amakusa used as a weapon. This orb apparently belongs to the Mayans, and Tam-Tam uses it to heal the ailments of those around him. Tam-Tam can throw skulls, summon rising demons, and spin his flaming sword while moving toward his opponent.EarthquakeBased in Texas, Earthquake is the leader of a gang of thieves searching for treasure. In fact, upon defeating Amakusa, his three subordinates return to him with piles of treasure. He is tall, fat, and missing several teeth. Earthquake can rush toward his opponent as a spinning blade ball, or bounce toward them to harm them with his butt.NakoruruAn Ainu priestess, Nakoruru is not only one of the two female characters in the first Samurai Shodown, but also one of two characters who fight with animal friends. Her hawk, Mamahaha, can lift Nakoruru into the air, allowing her to drop down and slash her opponent. She can also rush toward her opponent, either remaining on the ground or rising up to do so.Wan-FuThe King of China, Wan-Fu is the only character who can voluntarily give up their weapon. This is done by jumping into the air and tossing a flaming sword at the opponent. Usually, when the AI does this, they run toward the sword to retrieve it. Wan-Fu can also perform an uppercut with his sword.HaohmaruHaohmaru's ending.The protagonist of the Samurai Shodown series, Haohmaru is a Japanese swordsman. His moves include sending a tornado at enemies and a type of sword uppercut. After his fight with Amakusa, Haohmaru returns to Japan and fights Mai Shiranui of King of Fighters fame.HanzoA Tokugawa ninja based on a historical figure. He can send fire toward his opponents, throw shurikens, and disappear to strike from above. After defeating Amakusa, Hanzo spends his life training other ninjas.KyoshiroA kabuki actor, Kyoshiro can toss flaming fans, spin-jump at his opponents, and use his poll to thrust himself at the opponent as a fireball.[CR]Ports[CR]The SNES port of Samurai Shodown removed a lot from the arcade original, like the blood and large battlefields.After being made for the Neo Geo, Samurai Shodown was ported to many systems. However, few were capable of running the game at the technical level that the Neo Geo did. For example, the SNES, Genesis, and Sega CD versions removed the scaling present in the original; instead, they kept the characters at a constant size (the Genesis and Sega CD used the large sprites, the SNES their small counterparts). The SNES and Genesis versions also removed the blood present in the original. The port closest to the original was the 3DO version, which kept the scaling and blood that the others lacked.In addition to a playable Amakusa, the Game Boy version had two additional unlockable characters: Kuroko, the referee, and Hikyaku, the courier man that throws item onto the battlefield. Although Kuroko would also become a playable character in later games, Hikyaku has yet to resurface in that role.Samurai Shodown would also appear in later compilations alongside other Samurai Shodown games. It was ported to the PS1 along with its sequel under the name Samurai Spirits Kenkaku Shinan Pack. However, this port was only available in Japan. However, it would also appear in Samurai Shodown Anthology for the Wii, PS2 and PSP, along with its five direct sequels.Samurai Shodown, along with II and III, were also ported to the Wii's Virtual Console. All three were ports of their Neo Geo incarnations, making it unlikely that the SNES and Genesis ports of the game will be ported, as well.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Play as Amakusa in 2-player mode[CR]When the Takara logo appears, press: A, Y, X, B. You will hear a strange sound. On the player select screen, hold down the L and R buttons on both controllers and press start when choosing a character. </plot>

				<title_clean>Saturday Night Slam Masters</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Saturday Night Slam Masters (known in Japan as Muscle Bomber: The Body Explosion) is a 2.5D wrestling game developed and released by Capcom for Arcade (via the enhanced CPS-1 hardware) on July 13, 1993. The game plays similar to other Arcade wrestling games of the time (taking place in a standard wrestling ring where the player has three-dimensional movement of their characters). However, the game includes original international (and colorful) characters, including Mike Haggar from the Final Fight franchise, wrestling to climb the ranks of the fictional Capcom Wrestling Federation (CWF).[CR]All versions of the arcade game featured a Single Match (featuring traditional one-on-one matches) mode. Arcade cabinets that supported four players featured a Team Battle Royale mode (featuring two-on-two elimination matches). An updated version of the Arcade release (titled Muscle Bomber Duo: Ultimate Team Battle in the international version and Muscle Bomber Duo: Heat Up Warriors in the Japanese version) was released on December 1993, removing Single Match mode (focusing on the Team Battle Royale mode) while refining the grappling mechanics, adding new moves (for all characters) and allowing players to select the same character.[CR]Saturday Night Slam Masters was ported to the FM Towns Marty (in Japan only) on November 1993, and then ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Genesis in 1994. While the SNES version was the only version to include Team Battle Royale mode (thanks to multitap accessories), the Genesis version includes an exclusive Death Match mode, which grants more weapons to use, covers the ropes with barbed wire and proximity explosives (making it impossible to bounce off the ropes, but allows players to damage their opponents by throwing them at the ropes), and lays land mines outside the arena.[CR]On September 2, 1994, the game received a sequel, titled Ring of Destruction: Slam Masters II, which refined it to a traditional fighting game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game controls not unlike a simplified Capcom 2D fighting game, including a single button for attacks, a jump button and a grapple button. Wrestlers can also run against the ropes of the ring, creating a new set of running attacks. Each wrestler featured has one unique special move as well as a finisher they can perform from the grapple once they had depleted their opponents health bar low enough. Once the opponent's health bar is either completely empty, or close to empty, the wrestler can attempt a pin to win or use a submission move to make their opponent quit. Matches can also end with a 20-count ring out.[CR]The game features two play modes: Single Match, which featured traditional one-on-one wrestling matches, and Team Battle Royale, which featured two-on-two elimination style matches. In Team Battle Royale, both members of a team have to be pinned or submit for the other team to win. Players could either form a cooperative team, or a single player could have a CPU controlled partner. If playing Team Battle Royale in single player, the match ends in a " No Contest" if the player character is pinned and his CPU controlled partner is not.[CR]The game also features the ability to leave the ring. Various weapons can be found that allow a wrestler to greatly damage their opponent. The game features no disqualifications for using weapons.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]CharacterBioAlexander "The Grater"Alexander "The Grater" (known in the Japanese version as Sheep the Royal) is an American wrestler (Australian in the Japanese version) and butcher (from Kentucky, U.S.A.).He is based on the real life wrestler Big Van Vader.Biff SlamkovichBiff Slamkovich (known in the Japanese version as Aleksey Zalazof) is a Russian wrestler (from Kiev, Ukraine) and the main protagonist of the series.Also known as "The Rocking Ruskie", he is an apprentice of Mike Haggar, and considers fellow apprentice Gunloc as his rival.

				<plot>Based on the first season of the TV series of the same name, your character is an officer of the UEO: The United Earth Oceans Organization. You begin the game inside a training simulation, which upon successful completion ensures your transfer to the crew of the seaQuest DSV where you will be called upon to perform the same duties.[CR]Primarily, your function is to navigate the seaQuest Deep Submergence Vessel around the underwater map to various 'mission areas' where you will be called upon to use the on board vehicles to accomplish some task. Typical missions include salvage operations, rescue operations, disarmament of underwater explosives, termination of enemies and exploration. Damage of underwater property is deducted from your budget and completion of objectives adds to it. The money must be used to resupply weapons and buy additional vehicles. Underwater is a dangerous place.[CR]The vehicles you have at your command include[CR]1. Speeder: A simple two-man vessel designed entirely for speed. It is also a combat vessel and may fire forwards, move up &amp; down and change orientation between facing left and facing right[CR]2. Stinger: A prototype "next generation" attack vessel, this one-man sub allows you to orientate in any direction to fire your weapon accurately.[CR]3. Sea Crab: A slow vehicle used for excavation, mining, and rescue missions. It is the only vessel that can dock with other vessels and one of only two that can pick up undersea objects for transport. It comes with a water jet to clear debris and a retractable drill[CR]4. Sea Truck: Slow and bulky, this vessel may move up and down and change it's orientation between left and right. It's weapons are torpedoes and mines which may be dropped behind it. Furthermore it can also pick up undersea objects for transport[CR]5. Remote (HR) Probe: Small and agile, this vehicle contains only a very simple weapon. It's main purpose however is underwater welding and repair of objects. It can also activate switches[CR]6. Darwin - Intelligent Dolphin and seaQuest mascot: Darwin the Dolphin is perhaps the most agile of the vehicles, and may take off in bursts of speed. However Darwin has no weapons with which to defend himself and is very vulnerable. Darwin is able to get into tiny spaces that none of the other vehicles can reach. Darwin is able to activate switches.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Practice Passwords[CR]The following passwords allow you to practice missions and use 99 mini-subs.

				<title_clean>Secret of Evermore</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Composer Jeremy Soule[CR]Secret of Evermore is an action RPG for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System which uses a lot of gameplay concepts found in the popular Mana series. It is notable for being soundtrack composer Jeremy Soule's first video game. It is also the first and so far only game developed by Square designers in North America. After lackluster sales and reviews, the team was dissolved and spread out to many other developers such as EA, Gas Powered Games and Microsoft Game Studios.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The machine that sends the boy and his dog to the world of Evermore.[CR]The game begins in 1965 in the fictional American small town named Podunk, where a scientist named Professor Ruffleberg created the world of Evermore, a utopia which could be manifested in any way its inhabitants saw fit. During its unveiling at a party, however, something went wrong and trapped all of the party's guests in Evermore with no way of escape.[CR]Thirty years later, a young boy and his pet dog are on their way home from the cinema when the dog decides to chase a cat. The boy follows him into the Professor's abandoned mansion, where they accidentally activate a machine that sends them to the world of Evermore. They soon discover that things in Evermore aren't working as they're supposed to, so they must set out across the world to meet its inhabitants and find their way home.[CR]Each of the original inhabitants has a world designed to their liking. Depending on the realm the player is currently in, the dog transforms into a creature more suitable to his surroundings, making him faster, stronger and a great companion in combat.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Secret of Evermore is a top-down action RPG. The player controls the boy and the dog as they travel around Evermore fighting monsters, casting spells and talking to non-player characters. The majority of the gameplay elements were copied from the successful game Secret of Mana, also released by Squaresoft, such as the controls, the combat system and the ring menu system. It also as a few unique elements of its own.Combat[CR]Combat is a simple case of facing the main character towards an enemy, and pressing the attack button. At the bottom of the screen there is a 'power bar' for each character. This displays the character's current hit points (HP) and the character's current combat state. If an attack is made, a small counter on the bar quickly fills back up to 100% - if another attack is made before it reaches 100% then that attack is slightly weaker. This means the player must time their attacks correctly to deal the most damage.[CR]Holding the attack button down will charge up the power bar. It will fill up as many times as that character has leveled up in their weapon. When the button is released, the character will perform a special attack, which has varying power depending on how long it has been charged. Some special attacks deal more damage, or more hits, or will connect with more enemies at once.Alchemy[CR]Instead of a traditional magic system, Secret of Evermore has the player come across alchemy ingredients during the game. Alchemy recipes can be learned from different characters, and when the player has collected the right combination of ingredients, they can be converted in one use of the alchemy spell. The spell can be cast any time the player likes after that, however only a limited amount of recipes can be memorized by the character at any one time. Alchemy spells will level up and become stronger with repeated use.[CR]The player can also utilize "call beads" to summon previously met characters, who can cast more powerful spells.The Dog[CR]By holding down the 'sniff' button, the dog will begin to sniff the surroundings, and will lead the player to places where there are hidden alchemy ingredients and other items. The dog will also change into different forms depending on which realm the characters are in: In Prehistoria he is grey and look like a wolf, in Antiqua he is white and looks like a greyhound, in Gothica he is a pink poodle, and in Omnitopia he is a robot and gets a ranged attack.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]CharacterDescriptionThe BoyThe Boy is the game's protagonist, and the one the player controls. He is a great fan of B-movies and is always spouting off one liners from his favorite films. He lives in Podunk, USA, and bravely sets forth in Evermore to try and save it's inhabitants.The DogThe dog is fiercely loyal to his owner, but prone to chasing cats. He accompanies the boy on his journey, and makes great use of his ability to sniff out important items. He is also a reliable companion in battle, willing to attack anything that poses a threat.Fire EyesFire Eyes, also known as Elizabeth, lives in the jungle world of Prehistoria. She is the first of the inhabitants that the pair meets and she sets them on the right path through Evermore. After meeting her, she can be summoned with Call Beads to cast spells.Horace HighwaterHorace Highwater was a museum curator, and as such he created the realm of Antiqua to indulge his interest in ancient civilizations. He can also be summoned by using a call bead.Camellia BluegardenCamellia Bluegarden created the realm of Gothica and made herself the queen. She can be summoned using call beads to cast spells.Professor Sidney RufflebergProfessor Ruffleberg created the experiment that is Evermore, and when trapped there, he created the realm of Omnitopia to fulfill his fascination with technology. He is the last of the inhabitants that the pair will meet.CarltronCarltron is Ruffleberg's robot butler and the game's main antagonist . Taken at face value, he is an obedient and forthright servant, however he is actually evil, and is the cause of all the strife in Evermore. In the end his plans are shut down (as is he). When the game ends, the last scene shows that Carlton is returning to his duties as Ruffleberg's butler, but he may not be as docile as the Professor is led believe.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]CD Track List(Orchestrated songs: #1-8; SNES music #9-29)Secret of Evermore Soundtrack"10 PRINT Hello World""Variations of Castle Theme""The Secret of Evermore""Ancient World""Greek Temple""Pirate""Ocean Theme""Merchant Theme""The Queens""Flying""Greek Temple""The Scientist""Introduction""Puppet Song""Mini Boss""Greek Temple II""Cecil's Town""Over the Waterfall" -"The Rat's Chamber""White Castle Town""Quick Sand Field''"Dark Castle""The Tinkerer""White Castle""Freak Show""Dog Maze""Final Boss Music""Ending Music""The Return"[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] infinite run stamina[CR]With any weapon that has reached level three you can exploit an infinite run glitch.

				<title_clean>Secret of Mana</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Secret of Mana (Seiken Densetsu 2 in Japan) is an action role-playing game for the Super Nintendo. The game is the second in the Seiken Densetsu franchise of games.[CR]Secret of Mana uses a top-down view like most 16-bit RPGs, but from there the similarities end. The combat uses a real-time battle system, while magic can be cast in the middle of battle using the game's ring menu system. Secret of Mana is a co-operative multiplayer RPG, allowing a second player and/or third player (using the SNES Multi-tap addon) to take control of the hero's allies.[CR]Secret of Mana is widely regarded for its beautiful and colorful 16-bit graphics, epic story, unique soundtrack, as well as its action oriented and multiplayer capable combat system.[CR]Rather than using the traditional turn-based battle system of games like Final Fantasy, Secret of Mana utilizes real-time battles akin to the Legend of Zelda series, while also employing typical role-playing elements and a unique "Ring Command" menu system, which pauses the action, and allows a variety of actions to be performed without needing to switch screens. The game received considerable acclaim for its brightly colored graphics, expansive plot, "Ring Command" menu system, innovative real-time battle system, modified Active Time Battle meter adapted for real-time action, its innovative cooperative multiplayer gameplay, where the second or third players could drop in and out of the game at any time rather than players having to join the game at the same time, the customizable AI settings for computer-controlled allies, and the acclaimed soundtrack by Hiroki Kikuta. Secret of Mana was an influential game in its time, and has remained influential through to the present day, such as its customizable AI for player characters being used by many later games, its ring menu system still used in modern games (such as The Temple of Elemental Evil) and its cooperative multiplayer mentioned as an influence on games as recent as Dungeon Siege III.[CR]Development[CR]The game was developed by Squaresoft, designed and produced by Hiromichi Tanaka, and programmed by Nasir Gebelli. This was the same team that had produced Final Fantasy III, which Gebelli used as a basis for programming Secret of Mana.[CR]According to Tanaka in 2011 and 2013, the game was originally intended to be Final Fantasy IV, before becoming a new project called Chrono Trigger, and then eventually Secret of Mana. In his own words:[CR]After we finished FFIII, we started FFIV with the idea of a slightly more action-based, dynamic overworld rather than keep combat as a completely separate thing. But, at some point, it wound up not being IV anymore&#8230; Instead, it was eventually released as &#8220;Seiken Densetsu 2&#8243; (Secret of Mana), but during development it was actually referred to as &#8220;Chrono Trigger&#8221;. (laugh)[CR]At the time, just after FFIII, we were working with Mr. Toriyama on a game with a seamless, side-view system. A CD-ROM attachment for the Super Famicom was scheduled to be released, you see. So we had this enormous game planned out for the CD-ROM attachment, but ultimately we were never able to release it.[CR]So we had the Chrono Trigger project changed to a new game, and this other game we had been working on was condensed down into Seiken Densetsu 2. Because of this, Seiken 2 always felt like a sequel to FFIII to me.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Using the power of Mana, a civilization had grown strong... In time, Mana was used to create the ultimate weapon: the Mana Fortress... This angered the Gods. They sent their beasts to destroy the Fortress... A violent war rocked the world, and Mana seemed to disappear.... Before all was lost, a hero with the Mana Sword smashed the fortress... Though the civilization had been destroyed, the world was peaceful again. But time flows like a river...and history repeats.[CR]When a boy finds a sword on the outskirts of his village, he only wanted a tool to cut through the brush to get home. What he got was the legendary Sword of Mana, drained of power and in need of someone to wield it. By pulling the sword free, the young man releases monsters in the surrounding forest. The boy is subsequently banished from his village, and embarks on a quest to reforge the Mana Sword. Joined in his travels by a Princess and Sprite child, the boy becomes the hero that the world needs, and will search the world for the Mana seeds and fight an empire that seeks to repeat the mistakes of history and revive the Mana Fortress.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The Heroes[CR]While the internet likes to give the heroes names, none of the releases of the game, nor the manual or other material (such as Nintendo Power), provide default names for the characters. Supposedly these are the translated names from the Japanese manual, but this has never been confirmed. These names are included here for continuity with other material from the Secret of Mana gaming community.The Boy / The Hero, "Randi"The Boy[CR]The boy is an orphan in the town of Potos raised by the town elder. When the boy finds a sacred sword on the outskirts of his village, he releases monsters in his village and is banned from the town. The boy begins down his destined road to become the Mana Hero, restoring the swords power, unlocking the power of the world's Mana seeds, discovering his true past and fighting an empire that seeks to rule the world.The Girl, "Purim"The Girl[CR]The King of Pandora wants this princess to marry against her will. The girl's boyfriend, Dyluck, has also been kidnapped. The girl joins the heroes quest to help save Dyluck. The girl eventually gains the power to summon mana elementals and cast magic. The majority of the girl's magic is defensive and restorative magic.

King Truffle raises the dragon, and teaches him to respond to the bang of a special drum. The heroes will eventually be able to ride Flammie to anywhere in the world, including the Mana Fortress.NekoNeko[CR]Neko is a merchant who has a shop to the west of Potos. Neko, however, is a traveling merchant. The player will find him in the wild whenever he is needed most. Neko's prices are expensive, selling items at double their cost in towns, but in a pinch they are worth it. Neko can also provide a means to save the game. For much of the game, Neko was the only place to get Fairie Walnuts, which restored MP.Luka[CR]Luka is the guardian of the Water Palace and its Mana Seed. The 200 year old guardian keeps tabs on the outside world from the ebb and flow of the waters that pass through her palace.Dyluck[CR]A republican solider, Dyluck is leading an attack against the witch Elinee when he is kidnapped by Thanatos. The Girl is in love with Dyluck, and joins the hero's team in a quest to save him. The trio encounters him multiple times through the story, as Thanatos has selected Dyluck as the new body to possess and has placed Dyluck under a trance.WattsWatts[CR]Watts is the world's greatest blacksmith, and the only capable of upgrading the hero's Mana weapons. Watts has the uncanny ability of following the party everywhere, seemingly being in all of the games towns at the same time.The Republic[CR]The Republic is an army who vows to destroy the Empire. Jema, a knight from the Republic, repeatedly helps the hero on his quest.JemaJema[CR]Jema is an experienced Tasnican knight who fought alongside the boy's father. Jema discovers the boy during a battle against monsters in Potos, and will repeatedly guide the boy in his quest to reforge the sword and become the Mana Knight.The Resistance[CR]The Resistance is a group of civilians who aim to fight against the empire and stop them from using Mana to revive the Mana fortress. The base of the resistance is disguised as a cafe in Northtown.Enemies[CR]While our heroes will fight a seemingly unending amount of monsters and bosses, these are the true enemies pulling the strings.[CR] Emperor Vandole[CR]Emperor Vandole rules The Empire. Vandole seeks to steal the mana seeds and control the power of mana for himself, with the ultimate goal of reviving the Mana Fortress.[CR] Geshtar[CR]One of Emperor Vandole's personal body guards, Geshtar does much of the Emperor's dirty work.

Thanatos, however, has plans of his own, and is responsible for the kidnapping of Dyluck. The heroes will have to fight Thanatos in the form of the Dark Lich.[CR] The Scorpion Army[CR]These would be mana seed thieves are not very bright but quite tenacious, and the heroes have to thwart their attempts to steal the mana seeds several times. The heroes never directly fight the Scorpion Army, but instead their robots Kilroy and Kettle Kin.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]A boss[CR]Secret of Mana plays like other Action/RPG games of the time, such as Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. The directional pad moves the currently controller character around, and the face buttons are used for attacking, activating items and dialogue, and opening the game's unique " ring" menu system.[CR]There are three characters playable in the game, and all are on-screen for the majority of the game. When not under player control, a character's actions are assumed by the game's artificial intelligence (AI), following the player character around and attacking on their own. This AI has a notoriously weak path-finding system, often causing characters to get stuck. The game provides an "action grid," where the behavior of an AI controlled ally can be tweaked. There are various settings between aggressive and defensive, and the power level of attacks can be adjusted. The player can also use the AI allies "ring menu" to cast magic. With the use of a multi-tap peripheral, all three characters can be player-controlled, making Secret of Mana one of the first co-op console games with more than two players. This occasionally had unintended consequences as the players could attempt to go different directions, 'trapping' all the players in the active screen and preventing forward momentum.Combat[CR]Combat is a simple case of facing the character towards an enemy, and pressing the attack button. At the bottom of the screen there is a 'power bar' for each character. This displays the character's current hit points (HP) and the character's current combat state. If an attack is made, a small counter on the bar quickly fills back up to 100% - if another attack is made before it reaches 100% then that attack is slightly weaker. This means the player must time their attacks correctly to deal the most damage.[CR]Holding the attack button down will charge up the power bar. It will fill up as many times as that character has leveled up in their weapon. When the button is released, the character will perform a special attack, which has varying power depending on how long it has been charged. Some special attacks deal more damage, or more hits, or will connect with more enemies at once. Up to 8 levels of each weapon could be unlocked per character. The weapons also had individual characteristics (whips could cross chasms, spears could attack enemies from a far, Bows could shoot enemies on far away platforms, etc.)[CR]The heroes fight a maximum of three enemies on screen at any time.Magic[CR]The heroes will eventually gain the ability to summon the eight Mana elementals and cast magic. The boy is unable to cast any magic, as his Mana sword will eventually be more powerful than any magic. The sprite gains the ability to cast offensive magic. The girl gains the ability to cast primarily defensive and restorative magic.[CR]As the world's mana seeds are unlocked by the mana sword, the potential of the heroes mana magic increases. Each elemental can be leveled to a maximum of eight levels. An allies skill in a particular magic increases as it is used. The following levels becomes increasingly harder to obtain. So, for example, while a elemental might reach level 1 from level 0 after casting a spell 10 times, it could take casting the spell 100 times to move from level 7 to level 8. The increase in an elemental's level not only increases the power of the magic's effect, but also causes a subtle change in that spells graphical effects, which get more elaborate as the spells level up.[CR]Spells are cast using the games "ring menu" system, and combat continues while a spell is being cast. For a short period at the beginning of a spell, the character summoning the mana elemental cannot be moved. Once this summoning is complete, all characters can continue to move and fight as the spell is cast.[CR]The exception to this is "Level 9" spells. When spells reach their maximum level of 8, the player can continue to gain magic experience up to level 8.99. "Level 9" spells can occur at any point after level 8.01. The closer the player is to level 8.99, the more often they occur. They also occur more while "mashing" the attack button during casting. These rare "Level 9" spells freeze all action in the game while they occur. They have increase graphical effects. For example, fireballs become dragons. These "Level 9" spells also increase the spells effect greatly.[CR]Magic can be targeted to a single target or to all applicable targets. For example, cure water can be used to cure a single ally, or can be cast on all allies. An offensive spell can be cast on a single target or all targets on screen. A spell's effect is greatest on a single target.[CR]The mana elementals and their spells are listed in the order they are obtained:Undine - Water ElementalUndine - The Water Elemental[CR]Undine is found in Undine's cave.

There are eight different weapons and they are shared by the three playable characters, that is, one weapon may not be wielded by more than one character at once. During the course of the game, the player characters will come across 'orbs'. When taken to a character in the game known as "Watts", he will 'forge' the orb into the corresponding weapon allowing for a higher level capacity. Additionaly, certain levels of weapon evolution have other benefits, such as the ability to deal extra damage to a certain class of enemies or inflict certain status effects.[CR]The orbs were usually awarded to the player for completing the game's quests and dungeons, however due to the game being scaled down to fit on the Super Nintendo cartridge, some weapons' orbs were dropped by standard enemies in the final dungeon.[CR]Each different weapon is listed as follows, in the order they are obtained, with the name for each level of upgrade. Many weapons also have other unique gameplay abilities, just as cutting obstacles or pulling characters across gaps.Sword[CR]The sword is the first weapon gained in the game, found near the river in the beginning of the game. It is a close range weapon, which can also be used to cut down certain obstacles in the world like bushes. The sword in it's ninth level, as the Mana Sword, is by far the most powerful weapon in the game. The Mana Sword can only be unlocked properly via the use of "Mana Magic" in the game's final battle. It can be unlocked earlier by using a glitch in the game to get an extra sword orb.The boy pulling the rusty sword from a tree stump.Rusty SwordBroad SwordHerald SwordClaymoreExcaliburMasamuneGigas SwordDragon BusterMana SwordSpear[CR]The spear is given to the hero by Sage Luka of the Water Palace.

Some are unique items that are found or recieved and have unlimited uses. Others are consumable items that are store bought or found in treasure chests that are lost upon use.

Pressing left and right on the D-pad will rotate the ring, while pressing up and down will switch between different menu rings, which cover the player's inventory, a character's spells, weapons, and game options. This unique radial menu system allows quick selection of items and a minimal interruption in the real time combat.[CR]Development[CR]SNES Disc Drive[CR]Until the project was canceled, Secret of Mana being developed to come out with the launch of the SNES CD add-on. When the add-on was canceled, the game lost approximately 40% of its original content and the graphics were reduced to accommodate a standard cartridge. Examples of unused game portions include staircases that lead to nowhere and doors that are unreachable. Additionally, some parts of the game can be buggy at times due to the alteration.Full Channel Music[CR]The SNES audio processor is only capable of producing eight sounds at once. Many songs in Secret of Mana using seven to eight channels. This highly unusual use of all audio channels allows the music to be richer, but requires the game to drop channels of music when producing sound effects. Depending on how the player perceives it, this could range from not noticeable to jarring and annoying.English localization[CR]The English translation for Secret of Mana was hampered for multiple reasons. First, in an effort not to miss the 1993 holiday season, the English translation was completed in only 30 days. This is compared to the many months usually afforded to English localization efforts.[CR]Secondly, the English release of Secret of Mana uses a fixed-width font to display gameplay text. This choice of font greatly limits the available space to display text. Accoring to the translator of the game, Ted Woolsey, a large portion of the game's script was cut from the English release due to these space limitations and the lack of sequential text. Many conversations are cut down to their bare minimum.[CR]A rom hack, FuSoYa&#8217;s Niche's Secret of Mana Variable Width Font Edition, was released that brings variable width fonts to the game and uses the extra room to expand the dialogue. This expanded dialogue, however, is fan made, and does not come from the Japanese release, as sometimes is thought.Graphics"Mode 7" graphics show the overworld of Secret of Mana[CR]The graphics of Secret of Mana place the characters within the surroundings to the point where the colors portray them as part of the world, as opposed to standing out while on it. Despite some people disliking the lack of clarity between the two areas, most players like the absorbing combination.[CR]Secret of Mana pushes the SNES to its limit not only on an artistic, but on a technical level. It is one of only a few games to use a 512x224 pixel "high resolution" mode to display additional information at times. Other portions of the game using the SNES's " Mode 7" capability to create large, scaled, rotatable backgrounds to give the illusion of three dimensions, such as when traveling on Flammie.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Seiken Densetsu 2 Original Sound Version[CR]Secret of Mana's unique soundtrack was composed by Hiroki Kikuta. The soundtrack was released in Japan as Seiken Densetsu 2 Original Sound Version and later released in the US as Secret of Mana Original Soundtrack. Both releases of the 44 track, 66:20 soundtrack are currently out of print and no longer available.[CR]The names of the songs are known alternately as their translated Japanese names or their localized English titles.Track Listing[CR]Track # Localized title / Translated titleFear of the Heavens / Angel's FearA Curious Tale / A Mysterious StoryPhantom and ...A Rose... / Rose and SpiritTogether Always / Always TogetherFond Memories / Kind MemoriesInto the Thick of It / The Boy Heads for the WildernessThe Color of the Summer Sky / Summer Sky BlueDancing Animals / Dancing BeastsDistant Thunder / Distant ThunderThe Little Sprite / The Child of the Fairy TribeIt Happened Late One Evening / Occurence of Moonlit NightIn the Dead of Night / The Dark InsideMystic Invasion / The Holy IntrusionSecret of the Arid Sands / Secret of the Hot SandWhat the Forest Taught Me / What the Forest TaughtA Wish... / A WishSpirit of the Night / Soul of the NightDid you See the Ocean? / Did you See the Sea?Danger / CrysisCalm Before the Storm / Orphans of the StormThe Wind Never Ceases / Where the Wind SplitsFlight Into the Unknown / Flight Into the UnknownEternal Recurrence / Eternal RecurrenceThe Legend / The LegendA Bell is Tolling / Eight O'ClockA Curious Happening / A Strange IncidentMonarch on the Shore / The King of the CoastThe Dark Star / The Star of DarknessProphesy / PremonitionSteel and Snare / Steel and TrapsWhisper and Mantra / Prayer and WhisperCeremony / CeremonyMorning is Here / Reach for TomorrowLeave Time for Love / Time to LoveStill of the Night / Pure NightThe Curse / The CurseThe Oracle / The WizardA Conclusion / A ConclusionI Won't Forget / I Won't Forget YouOne of Them is Hope / That One is HopeMeridian Dance / Meridian FestivalNow Flightless Wings / Wings Flapping no LongerThe Second Truth From the Left / The Second Truth from the EndI Closed My Eyes / I Closed my EyesSecret of ManaSecret of Mana[CR]Hiroki Kikuta would later release Secret of Mana , a CD containing a single fifty minute track incorporating various arranged themes from Secret of Mana.

				<title_clean>Shadowrun</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shadowrun blends fantasy and cyberpunk.[CR]Shadowrun is a noir cyberpunk RPG, based off of the novel Never Deal with a Dragon by Robert N. Charrette. Other aspects of the game are inspired by William Gibson's Neuromancer and Blade Runner. Shadowrun deals with concepts such as monopolized corporations, a large interconnected cyber world, the reawakening of magic in a technologically advanced society, and biomechanics body augmentation in a dystopian setting.[CR]The Super Nintendo Entertainment System version of Shadowrun was released on November 1, 1993. Developed by Beam Software and published by Data East, the game is entirely different from its Sega Genesis and Sega CD counterparts of the same name. All three are based on the pen-and-paper role-playing game, released by FASA. This version of the game was fairly well-received critically, but did not sell well enough to reflect this.[CR]Several beta versions of Shadowrun exist, and ROM images of them are available on the internet (something that is fairly uncommon for a game of the time). These beta versions reflect a much more uncensored version of Shadowrun, with sexually suggestive lines, violently suggestive lines, and alcoholic references (replaced with "iced tea" in the actual game). Interestingly enough, the Japanese version of the game actually uses the same script, but subtitles the game in Japanese.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Even shooting enemies requires cursor interaction.[CR]Shadowrun is a blend of several different genres. At its core, it is an isometric action role-playing game, with elements of point-and-click adventure. In order to do any action in the game, the player must move the cursor to do this (e.g. aiming a gun at an enemy and firing, selecting items, opening doors, talking to non-player characters, etc).[CR]Many elements also take inspiration from the tabletop origins. Almost every action in the game is a combination of statistic and luck, with a Firearms statistic lending to accuracy, a Computer statistic lending to hacking ability, and Magic ability lending to spell strength. Enemies throughout the city also appear at random, requiring quick reflexes despite the point-and-click interface.The MATRIX is a top-down world, entirely different from the real world.[CR]A gameplay device known as "Jacking" allows Jake access to a computer network known as the "Matrix" (pre-dating the film of the same name). The Matrix is analogous to a secure intranet in most respects, though users are represented by avatars that may be harmed by damage. The user must avoid and neutralize security programs, in order to obtain information and funds. This carries some risk, as death in this virtual world also means death in real life.[CR]The dialogue system in the game is based around keywords. When discussing things with non-player characters, the player has three options: Exit, Talk, or Ask About. Talk gives a recycled line of dialogue, while Ask About gives a list of keywords that the player has already collected. This dialogue system is integral to progressing in the main game, triggering actions, and even purchasing or selling items.Bolded words denote keywords.[CR]Using money (the currency in Shadowrun is nuyen), players are able to hire mercenaries known as shadowrunners. The main character, Jake Armitage, himself is a shadowrunner. Shadowrunners are computer controlled allies, typically possessing magical abilities and pre-equipped weaponry and armor. However, shadowrunners can also die in battle, and once they die they cannot be revived.[CR]The leveling system in Shadowrun is different from more traditional role-playing games. Instead of gathering a set amount of experience from each battle, killing a certain amount of enemies earns Jake karma. Sleeping in a bed allows Jake to allocate this Karma accordingly. Each statistic has its own "level," and an equal amount of karma is required to level it up again. For example, if the health statistic is at level 10, another 10 karma is required to level it up to level 11.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Shadowrun takes place in Seattle, Washington in the year 2050. The player takes control of Jake Armitage, who in the opening of the game is shot and killed. A mage comes and revives him with magic as he is being carried off to the morgue. The game opens with Jake falling out of the morgue, groggy and confused. The rest of the game is his quest to find out who tried to kill him and why.[CR]The story progression is fairly non-linear, with much of the background plot and information given through the usage of data files found in the MATRIX. These files are in the form of communication between Jake's hitmen, information on key events, transactions, etc. There are set story events, but many of these do not occur until the end of the game.[CR]Through much investigation, Jake finds that the person who ordered his hit is a mysterious man named Drake. He tracks Drake down to a volcano base, where Jake discovers that Drake is, in reality, a dragon. Being held captive by Drake is a man named Pushkin. Apparently, he was supposed to be the recipient of an anti-AI program in Jake's head computer (a biomechanics device which stores information, located in Jake's brain). This anti-AI program was the reason behind Jake's death.[CR]The anti-AI program is able to neutralize Drake's employers, the Aneki Corporation. They are attempting to build a program to control the entire MATRIX. Jake and Pushkin escape the volcano, and travel to the Aneki headquarters. Located on the top floor is a supercomputer housing the malicious program. After inputting the anti-AI program, Jake escapes in a helicopter as the credits roll.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret debug Room[CR]The developers created a secret room for Quality Assurance that allowed them to quickly get money, karma as well as access to later parts of the game quickly.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret debug Room[CR]Here is the method:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret debug Room[CR]Outside the Morgue and just to the right is a flickering street light.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret debug Room[CR]1. Stand under the light on a crack in the ground where you see NPCs sometimes stopping at [CR]2. Bring up your item screen and select the Matchbox[CR]3. Examine it - If you are standing in the right location you will hear a *beep*[CR]4. Examine it a 2nd time - You will hear another *beep*[CR]5. Examine it a 3rd time - You will hear two *beeps* close together[CR]6. Examine it a 4th time - You will hear one beep again[CR]7. Leave the item screen and walk into the Morgue, just inside the door and stop in that hallway[CR]8. Examine your matchbox for a 5th time - You will hear three *beeps* close together[CR]9. Select the matchbox again and you will see that 'Examine L' has been replaced with 'Open R'[CR]10. Press R and you will be warped to the secret room.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret debug Room[CR]In this room you will find:[CR]A bunch of waitresses - These give money and karma (and spells too)[CR]A bunch of exits - These lead to different parts of the game[CR]A can of dog food - This item grants invincibility to Jake[CR]A bed - Just a normal bed[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret debug Room[CR]Note: If you aren't hearing beeps when you examine it, instead of standing exactly where the NPC stops try a step or two down and to the left of him on some cracks. Right up against the back of this street light worked for me too.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret debug Room[CR]Note: I believe the matchbox cannot be examined ever again after this and will always say *open R* and warp you to the room again if you try to examine it[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret debug Room[CR]I would like to thank Retro Gamer as it was their recent issue #120 which had an interview with the developers of Shadowrun (SNES) who mentioned that there was a hidden room that went undiscovered for 20 years and gave some clues that helped me find the *beeps*.[CR]I would also like to thank GameFAQ user JLukas for finding the missing last step of having to go back into the Morgue and examine it again. You're awesome!!![CR]I think it's really great that on the 20th year since Shadowrun (SNES) was released that we found a new secret!</plot>

				<plot>Shooter, a Super Nintendo horizontal space shooter, never actually made it into production but rather served as an in-house tech demo for Punk Development to test scrolling backgrounds.&amp;#x0D;[CR]The game demo boots up to a Punk Development logo screen before heading straight into the action. Player One controls the red spaceship, Player Two, the blue. Both ships can fire with the B button and move up, down, left, or right around the strikingly phallic-looking space scenery. The game can also be paused with the Start button (although the starry background will continue to scroll). A few generic-looking space pods parade around as well as what can only be described as giant grasshoppers (spacehoppers?). Crashing into any one of these floating pieces of space debris will cause the player&#8217;s ship to explode. Never fear, after going down in flames, a replacement ship will appear.&amp;#x0D;[CR]&amp;#x0D;[CR]Overall, this demo is very basic. A constant, low humming noise makes up the game&#8217;s entire audio ambiance, unless if you count the single sound effect that plays during the opening. The scrolling level loops infinitely.</plot>

				<title_clean>Sid Meier's Civilization</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sid Meier's Civilization is a turn-based  4X strategy game developed and published by  MicroProse for  MS-DOS in 1991. Designed by  Sid Meier, it is the first game in the  long-running series of the same name and the first game to popularize the 4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) sub-genre of strategy games. Players take on the role of a ruler of a civilization (loosely based on real-life historical civilizations) and is challenged to build it up amongst other empires (from two to six), from the end of the prehistoric era to the technological future.[CR]Over the years, the game received ports to the  Mac,  Amiga,  Atari ST,  Super Nintendo Entertainment System (published by  Koei in the United States and by  Asmik Ace in Japan),  PlayStation (published in Japan only by  Asmik Ace), and  N-Gage. A special port for the  Windows, titled  Sid Meier's CivNet, was released in 1995, featuring online multiplayer.[CR][B]History:[/B][CR]Sid Meier, a founder of MicroProse and veteran game designer, had established his name in the industry with such titles as Pirates!, Railroad Tycoon, and a variety of flight simulators. Drawing inspiration from two board games, Civilization from Avalon Hill and Risk, and two recently released computer games,  Populous and  SimCity, Meier set to work with Bruce Shelley on Civilization.[CR]While the game would see release via MicroProse, and Meier was a co-founder of the company, at the time of Civilization's creation, Meier was not an employee of MicroProse. Meier's former MicroProse partner, Bill Stealey, had changed the direction of the company away from PC games and into the home console and arcade market. Meier jumped ship prior to MicroProse going public.[CR]Inspired by their work on Railroad Tycoon, a deviation from their normal flight combat and military strategy games, Meier and Shelley began programming Civilization on an IBM PC in 1990. This began soon after MicroProse cancelled the sequel to  Railroad Tycoon. Meier personally handled all the programming and coding and all of the art for early incarnations of the game. The game became an all-consuming project, and Meier kept a notepad near his bed in case of sudden inspiration.[CR]Development occurred in cycles. Meier would develop a functioning prototype, hand it over to Shelley and they would dissect it until Meier went back to programming. The partners were the only ones involved in the early design process, with Meier unwilling to involve any other people until he was ready.[CR]An early incarnation of the game drew heavily from the duo's work on Railroad Tycoon and was equally inspired by SimCity. It was originally real-time based on zoning: players would choose areas for specific purposes and watch as their civilization slowly grew.[CR]At this moment in time, development was halted. Stealey, a former pilot, had developed MicroProse on the strength of flight simulators, and had little interest in other games. He was not particularly happy with the release of Railroad Tycoon, and Civilization would never had gotten so far if it were not for the previous game's success. Meier's status as a contractor, as opposed to employee, allowed the development of Civilization to continue. However, Stealey stepped in and refused to back the game, unless Meier and Shelley finished Covert Action, a action spy game that was set aside in favor of Railroad Tycoon.[CR]After Covert Action was finished, the team went back to Civilization where it saw the addition of its most important elements. First, the team incorporated turn based play. Zoning was abandoned and military strategy was added. Individual units were added that could be manipulated to various tasks. Meier also included the technology progression tree. During this time, little historic research was used. Instead Meier used popular conventions in how the public understood history, and incorporated these elements into his technology tree. With these additions to Civilization, the game was ready to leave the hands of Meier and Shelley.[CR]Due to the low priority of Meier's games at MicroProse, they had trouble securing the help they needed. It was only grudgingly that the company allowed the art team and play testing team to work on it.[CR]During this phase of development, the map was halved in size, large portions of the technology tree were removed, and units were removed. Prior to shipping however, Shelley developed the in-game reference guide, the Civilopedia, as well as the massive user manual.[CR]In 1991, the game shipped. It was late and saw very little promotion. However, on the strength of critical acclaim and word-of-mouth excitement, the game took the imagination of gamers everywhere and spawning a million selling franchise.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player takes on the role as a ruler of a civilization and is challenged to build an empire amongst up to six other civilizations. The game begins at the end of the prehistoric era, 4000 BC, in a world without cities. The player starts with one or two Settler units to build his empire with. The cities that the player builds and micromanage will determine the success of the empire.[CR]In order to win the player is forced to explore the world, wage war and participate in diplomacy. The player must also decide where to build new cities, which city improvements or units to build, and which new advances in knowledge to take.[CR]As new knowledge is acquired, new units and improvements will be available to the player. Getting ahead in the technology race is a great advantage to the player.[CR]There are special city improvement in the game called Wonders of the World. They can only be built once in the world and gives an advantage to the civilization that builds it.[CR]The game is won when the player has destroyed all other civilizations, reached the end of the modern era (2100 AD) with the highest score or won the space race by reaching the star system of Alpha Centauri first.Civilizations[CR]Players can select amongst 14 historical civilizations to play. The difference between them is mostly cosmetic. The choice will determine titles, city names, musical heralds and color.RomanBabylonianGermanEgyptianAmericanGreekIndianRussianZuluFrenchAztecChineseEnglishMongol[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Game Finish[CR]Be Russia, then name your 4th town Mizohu, and it will show every non-wonder building, 2000 turns, and future tech 24 in 1 turn.</plot>

				<title_clean>Side Pocket</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Created especially for the US market by Data East (though later released in Japan), Side Pocket is a pool simulator that saw several different ports for the various consoles of the era. The game is set around the tournament scene and gets progressively more difficult as the player goes from venue to venue, eventually entering a global competition.[CR]The WonderSwan version is the last game that Data East released before their bankruptcy.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game controls like many pool simulators (as well as several golf simulators of the time) by allowing the player to select which direction they wish to hit the cue ball in, with a handy dotted line to indicate its trajectory, and then they must tap a button to start the power gauge and tap it again to stop at the desired level of power. The balls then move around and if a ball is potted (provided it wasn't the cue ball) then the player is able to take an immediate additional turn. Play continues until the 8 ball has been sunk.[CR]Side Pocket is notable for how it tabulates a player's score: As well as scoring points for winning the game, sinking several balls consecutively and sinking them in numerical order, there are occasionally times where a pocket will light up and the player is able to score a bonus if they're able to sink a ball in that particular pocket. These points are racked up at the end of the match and dictate the overall score.[CR]Occasionally there is an opportunity for a bonus trick shot after the game is over to score additional points. These tend to involve potting specific balls in specific pockets, sometimes while avoiding obstacles on the table.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>SimAnt - The Electronic Ant Colony</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]SimAnt is another in the series of simulation games released by Maxis in the years after the success of SimCity was realized. It gives a player the opportunity to control a colony by having direct control over a single ant and using him to work towards completing certain goals. There are three types of games in SimAnt.Experimental: a sandbox mode with no objectives.Quick Game: The player must overpower the rivaling red ant colony.Full Game: Invade the house and cause the owner to evacuate.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player maintains control over a single yellow ant in the black colony; control can be swapped to another ant by simply double-clicking on it. The player's ant can pick up food, order other ants to follow him, and leave a scent trail for the colony to follow to food or enemies.The WorldThe backyard to be conquered.[CR]The SimAnt world is represented by 3 levels of detail. First, there is an ant farm perspective used to see what is going on in the underground colonies. This is useful for tracking the larvae and food supply of a colony. Second is the above ground view, which shows all activity on the surface in a single grid area of the world map. This is where hazards, or disasters, will present themselves.[CR]The world map is represented by the backyard and inside kitchen of a human family that is active throughout the course of the game. In the full game, the victory objective is to traverse the backyard with new colonies until a colony can be created in the kitchen.Expanding[CR]The unit creation system in SimAnt is based on an ant colony's caste system, with the player controlling amounts of workers, soldiers, and breeders to be born. Behavior--split into digging, foraging, and fighting--may also be modified. When new queens are born, they have wings that allow them to fly to other areas of the SimAnt world. These newborns can dig below ground and start broods, allowing the colony to start breeding new worker ants to support the colonies' needs. Through this expansion, it is possible to reach the inside of the house on the other side of the starting point in the backyard.Disasters[CR]Although there are no disasters such as earthquakes and tornadoes that the ant colonies will have to deal with, there are events that can occur that can spell disaster for your ant and colony. From time to time, a human will mow the lawn, which will wipe out all ants above the surface when it passes over the grid space. Children will run around the grass, and their footprints will smash any ants in their path when they reach the lawn grid. Rain will sometimes wash away ants and the scent trails you have laid down for the rest of your colony, as well as flooding portions of the nest. Indoors, electric sockets or ant poison can be found in abundance. Spiders and other insects pose a threat throughout all levels; if killed, though, these enemies provide a good deal of food for the colony.Ant WarsAn underground colony.[CR]In all game types, there is a competing colony of red ants trying to reach the same victory goals that the player is working towards. The red colony isn't superior in any mechanical way; the enemies are simply red to help the player distinguish friend from foe. When a red and black ant meet, they engage in a quick skirmish that will leave one of the ants dead, with the victorious ant most likely tired and unable to fight much more. In order to take over a red ant colony, the player must leave a scent trail that will lead other worker and soldier ants to it, so that a steady stream of black ants can lay siege to the underground network and eventually kill the breeding queen.[CR]Once the colony is taken over, a queen can be placed in the vacated network of tunnels, or the area can be deserted and left unused. In the Quick Game mode, the only objective is to take over the neighboring red ant colony in the same grid space - once that has been accomplished, the game is finished.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>SimCity</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]An example of a city.[CR]SimCity is a city-building simulation game released in 1989 and designed by eventual Sims creator Will Wright. SimCity, being Maxis' first game and originally based on the Commodore 64, has been adapted to several different personal computers and game consoles and has gone on to become one of the most successful and popular games of all time.[CR]Until the release of The Sims in 2000, the entire SimCity franchise was the most successful gaming franchise Maxis had created. Due to the immense popularity of SimCity, Maxis went on to create a multitude of other, similar simulation games, including SimTown and SimAnt., though none of these franchises has ever met the success of SimCity.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Sandbox vs. Scenario[CR]As would later to go on to define games of the SimCity franchise, the game first opens with the option of either building a city from the ground up (Sandbox) or running a city that is currently facing some issue or crisis (Scenario). In Sandbox mode, players choose a city site by choosing from a large list of premade maps and then giving a name to their city. Additionally, the Sandbox mode has no predefined goal or metric for "winning" the game, so players are free to run their cities as they see fit. Conversely, Scenarios have clearly defined metrics for winning (ex. double population in X years) and can be "lost".[CR]Versions[CR]SimCity was developed for a wide range of platforms and has seen multiple re-releases, each with their own changes and additions.iPhone[CR]An iPhone version of SimCity is available now, but it isn't this version of the game. The iPhone version is a remake of Simcity 3000, with some added features (such as better advisers).SNES[CR]The Super Nintendo version exhibited changes made by Nintendo, such as the addition of Bowser, and the character "Dr. Wright" who guides the player.SimCity Enhanced[CR]While the game play remained identical to the original PC release the CD-Rom enhanced edition featured Live Actors, Digitized Voice and Sound, and  Full Motion Video.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Simpsons: Bart's Nightmare is a 1992 title for the SNES and Genesis developed and published by Acclaim Entertainment. Based on the license for the animated television series The Simpsons, the game puts the player in the role of Bart Simpson. [CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Bart falls asleep at his desk.  [CR]As the game opens, Bart is working hard on his homework for once, but as the day goes on he becomes increasingly tired. He eventually falls asleep at his desk and his nightmares take him to a strange world. Bart has to collect the lost pages of his homework in his dream and avoid waking up prematurely.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is split up into two sections: Evergreen Terrace and Page Worlds.Evergreen TerraceEvergreen Terrace can get pretty crazy[CR]When on Evergreen Terrace, Bart wanders around the streets looking for pages of his homework that are floating around. The player's health is represented by a row of Zs near the top of the screen. If the player takes damage, a Z is lost. If all Z's are lost, the screen will lose most of its color. If the player takes damage again while in the "white out" state, Bart will wake up and the game will end. The player is then given a letter grade based on how many points they earned and how many pages of homework they gathered.[CR]There are a large amount of hazards that the player will encounter while on Evergreen Terrace.  Lisa Simpson flies around and sprinkles fairy dust on the player, turning Bart into a  frog. There are also  basketballs that bounce down the street, Jebediah Springfield's statue heads, mail boxes that cross the street, Otto speeding by in his bus, and Blinky the Fish. Many of the obstacles can be defeated by simply jumping over them which will award the player with points.[CR]The player is not completely defenseless here though. Bart can collect  power-ups by killing enemies, encountering certain popular Simpsons characters, and use watermelon seeds and  bubble gum to aid him. If the player is stuck as Frog Bart, they can wander into an old lady who will blow Bart a kiss that will return himto normal. Bubble gum allows Bart to regain health by spitting it at Z's floating around the street.  Principal Skinner also wanders around the streets carrying Bart's church outfit. If the player runs into him, Bart will don the  suit which will slow his movement speed but make him resistant to enemy damage.Page WorldsHmm... choices[CR]Once a homework page appears in Evergreen Terrace, the player will have to jump onto it which will shrink Bart down and be given the choice of two randomly chosen  mini-games represented by colored doors. If the player doesn't choose a door Bart will always go to the one on the left.[CR]The door colors are:Purple Door: Bart takes a journey into his own blood stream where he has to destroy germs using an air pump to inflate them until they pop.Blue Door: Bart becomes his superhero persona, Bartman. The player flies over  Springfield dodging missles, storm clouds, paper airplanes, and irradiated clouds. There are also boss fights with familiar Simpsons characters Sherri and Terri, Barney Gumble,  Waylon Smithers, and  C. Montgomery Burns. Nelson occasionally flies by using a hand glider to attack Bart and  Apu will ride a magic carpet dropping power-ups that replenish the player's health.BARTZILLA!! Yellow Door: Bart is transported into an episode of  Itchy and  Scratchy taking place in the Simpsons' house. The player has to defeat the cat and mouse using weapons scattered around the various areas while avoiding damage from insane household items like  refrigerators,  vacuum cleaners, telephones, and pictures of the Simpson family.Orange Door:  Indiana Bart must find his way through the  maze in the Temple of  Maggie. The player has to jump from four rows of stone platforms, some will drop if stepped. The player also has to avoid pterodactyls, the Devil, and projectiles fired from the background.Green Door: Bart becomes Bartzilla, stomping through the streets of Springfield battling army jets,  tanks, and  helicopters. Eventually the player will reach the Springfield State Building where they will battle Homer  Kong and Momthra on the roof.[CR] The game grades your skills[CR]If the player manages to reach the end of one of the mini-games, they'll collect a page of Bart's homework. If the player completes a mini-game level (page collected) or loses all of their lives (failed to collect page), the game flash to Bart sleeping in his room and display the player's score and how many pages they have collected. If the player manages to complete every mini-game and collect all of the lost homework pages, they will be given the game's proper ending.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Skuljagger - Revolt of the Westicans</title_clean>
				<plot>"I've never had so much fun with such an odd game"[CR]When one sees the title Skuljagger: Revolt of the Westicans, it invokes thoughts of a great game, based around pirates, murder, mystery and suspense. While you do not get all of that from Skuljagger, what you do get is something surprising, strange, and down right hilarious at times. This is a game that can be referred to as "The Bubble Gum Blowing Pirates Game."[CR]Skuljagger is the story of Jaxon Storm and the people of Westica. The Westicans have been forced into slavery on their home island by the evil pirate Skuljagger. For 10 years they have been forced to mine jewels and gems just to make Skuljagger and his pirate band richer. However, there is a small resistance group, headed by Storm. You control him through seven levels in his attempt to steal Skuljagger's sword and then eliminate him from his cruel grip on Wesitcan society.[CR]What you got here is essentially another platformer on a system flooded with games of this type. You jump, you attack, your run, you win. Innovation is not found in this sense. However, what does make Skuljagger different is the fact that bubble gum plays a bigger role in this game than it has in any pirate movie, film, TV show, or video game in the past.[CR]As you traverse through treacherous terrors, trembling timidly, (how is that for an alliteration) there will be random fruits scattered across the game. These fruits represent a different flavor of gum. The gum gives Storm different powers. Orange gum will allow him to spit bombs, cherry gum allows him to fly, and grape gum grants invulnerability. While this in and of its self may not be a new invention in video gaming, the fact that a pirate would use gum as an aid to destroy the evil occupiers of his home island is certainly a new concept.[CR]Players will find that the bubble gum concept not only adds to the game play, but provides a sort of comic relief, in the sense that it is outrageous that someone who is fighting for his freedom would be chewing bubblegum he finds along the way. Honestly, who would think to crack open a coconut and look for gum to chew, let alone actually finding it and doing just that?[CR]Level design is key for games of this manner to be enjoyable. They must contain enough variance that it doesn't feel like the same level over and over again. Skuljagger delivers, do a degree, on this level (pun intended). You will find your self scattered across the island, in many different places. You start out on the docks, move to a warehouse, end up in a lost city with ghosts, go to a beach and finish back on the docks. While there is some repetitive level design, everything is different each time you are at it and fits fantastically within the story.[CR]Speaking of the story, this is not just a game with a few lines of text, like what was summarized in the beginning. The manual includes a full color, 80 page comic book that explains the story in great detail. The comic book also has hints to the game. Scattered throughout the game are secret zones that you can only reach by standing in a specific location and pressing a button combination that you would not normally conceive.[CR]While this is an innovative idea, it is also a terrible idea. People who purchased the game brand new got to experience this innovation. However, for the rest of us who purchased this game used, we are stranded with no knowledge of how or where to find these hidden areas. Pressing eighty different buttons in every single location of the game is not anyone's idea of fun.[CR]To keep the game exciting, there are many different enemy types throughout the game. While you fight the same boss three out of seven times, the enemies in the game get progressively tougher as you move throughout the game. You start out fighting oversized bugs that casually walk in your general direction. By the time you finish, these same bugs fly at your head with blazing speed, not to mention the myriad of other enemies shooting bullets at you that you can barely see.[CR]There are few cheap deaths, but there are some. When you grab a continue gem and do not kill all the enemies around it before hand, you can run into some trouble. There will be times that the instant you re-spawn, you die. This is a great way to waste all your lives and continues.[CR]However, outside of this rare occurrence, the advent of these continue points is nice. There are levels that seem to last forever, and without the continue points, you will throw your controller in disgust when you die just before the end of the level, only to have to return to the beginning.[CR]In what is perhaps the most disappointing aspect of the game, the sound quality is nothing awe inspiring. While the music is diverse and mood setting, it is everything one would expect and nothing to become excited about. While the sound effects are all fitting and do not cause you to question their existence, again, they just do not do anything to cause excitement within ones mind.[CR]Brightly colored graphics are one of the bonuses of this game. There are very few palate swaps of enemies and the enemies are drawn very well. The backgrounds all look great and the levels are well detailed. Even though these are not ground breaking graphics, they are effective. Controlling storm is also easy and works very well. There are no instances where jumping seems super human, and sword swinging occurs with ease.[CR]One thing in particular that seasoned veterans of the SNES console and plat-formers in general will find good is the password system. While there are seven levels, only the first five have password, making the last two levels that can only be reached by defeating the ones before it. This is a great concept because it forces the player to defeat at least a portion of the game in order to reach the end. Once you reach that end and pass it, you will start over at the beginning, with your lives and your score intact. This adds to the challenge and replay ability of the game.[CR]Skuljagger is one of those games you need to play. While I cannot say that Skuljagger is the greatest game of all time, I can call it the greatest game involving pirates and bubble gum. There are some innovative parts to the game that will surprise even the most cynical of us, but there is also familiar game play that while nothing new, is simple and easy to master. Skuljagger is a game that most have never heard of. I suggest that you do your self a favor and go find this game, even if just for a cheap laugh. It is a surprisingly fun game that certainly is worth a couple of bucks. You may not get the fascinating and mysteriousness of what the title conveys, but at least you will get something you can enjoy.[CR]Reviewer's Score: 8/10, Originally Posted: 10/29/07[CR]Game Release: Skuljagger: Revolt of the Westicans (US, October 1992)[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]In-Game Hints[CR]Press R, L, and R at the island map at the beginning of each level[CR]Level Passwords:[CR]Cruel Man Cruel Bird Chapter 2[CR]Claw Is Mean Dock Chapter 3[CR]Big Wild Angry Fly Chapter 4[CR]Fly Home Lazy Sword Chapter 5[CR]Fantasy Zone Locations[CR]Fantasy Zones are mostly used for grabbing many Green Jemeralds.

Make sure you are holding 0 red and 0 green jewels.  Get to the end of and level, but do not grab the giant blue gem.  Wait until an enemy gets close and jump.  Time your jump so that you collide with the enemy and the ending gem at the exact same time.  Your lives will then say Player x 0 but you will perform the level ending pose.  You will move onto the next level without dying.  The next time you die, your lives will change from 0 to 99.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 99 lives[CR]This will only work if you are on your last life.  This happes because the counter goes down the instant you collide with an enemy, but you are not called dead by the game until you fall through the floor.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] &amp; Gameplay[CR]The player controls the hero Sky (Garuda in Japanese original) on his quest to defeat the Warlord Ashura and rescue the sorceress Ariana (Vishnu in Japanese original).[CR]Skyblazer's basic structure is similar to many platformers of the era: he must pass through and conquer a series of stages, defeating the bosses along the way, on his quest to gain power and reach the last stage where Ashura and the dark god Raglan await. There is the occasional branching path as well, which allows the player try a different stage if they're having trouble with the current one. As well as jumping and attacking, Sky can also climb walls and leap off them as well as use several offensive and defensive spells, many of which also increase his ability to traverse a stage as well. Some aerial stages require that Sky take to the air with his wings, a few of which use the Super Nintendo's Mode 7 functionality - these stages play a lot more like a shoot 'em up.[CR]Sky has several methods of attack which he gains by finding them spread around the levels. Sky's basic attack, a punch and kick combo, costs no magic points and he can perform it as often as he likes. He can also use the Dragon Slash from the offset, which is a powerful finishing attack that uses a little magic.[CR]Additionally, by defeating certain bosses/stages he can acquire:The Comet Flash, which sends Sky flying horizontally. This is invaluable for passing by floor obstacles like spikes and lava.Lightning Strike, which clears the screen of enemies. It's a move best left for emergencies, when enemies threaten to overcome the hero.Star Fire, which fires bullets in eight directions away from Sky.Heal, which gives Sky some health back.Warrior Force, a helpful buff that turns Sky invincible and increases his attack power.Time Stop, a power that freezes all enemies. It can be used on one boss.Fiery Phoenix, the only magic that can destroy Ashura's shield.[CR]All these attacks require magic power, which can be found throughout the stages and after defeating enemies. Along with magic power (represented as red potions) and health (represented as green potions), Sky can also collect diamonds. These diamonds will give Sky an extra life should he find 100 of the smaller ones or ten of the larger ones (which count as ten small diamonds each).[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The player controls a young boy named Jerry, who was a prince and ruler of the Kingdom. Jerry has been transformed into a blob by a mysterious wizard at the behest of his jealous brother, Tom, who has a crush on the young princess Emi. In that incarnation, the player has to played as a little jelly bean with eyes, travelling across a photorealistic grassy landscape. The game itself eventually had graphics and terrain that were now more cartoony and cuteness, which attached to younger viewers.[CR]The player also control only lines of defence are in flattening or stretching of his body to hit enemies, and in finding objects like balls to throw at them. The player can also run by holding down by pressing the Y button on the controllers. He can further stick to walls and ceilings by holding down the Y button as you jump towards them. The player can also advance through each level along a filmstrip map, and he/she can revisit previously-completed levels. Each level is a romp up and down hills, jumping between plaforms, and squeezing through pipes. Many enemies will come in the player's way, but they're easy to dispatch. Scattered around each level are a number of plants that open up to reveal balls, power-ups, 1ups, seeds, and jumping enhancers. Similar to Donkey Kong Country, the player must collect all 5 letters that spell JERRY in each level, if collecting them all will net you a couple of 1ups. It can be also be a save point as well.[CR]Sony removed the entire storyline from the game, as well as all the towns in levels, in the North American version. However, the English Translation patch of the Japanese version with scenes is available online to play for a Emulator.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Stage Select[CR]When the title screen reads 'Push Start Button', press UP, UP, DOWN, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, B, A, SELECT, START[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_Ball[CR]</plot>

				<plot>It seems like poor Snow White is always the intended victim in some evil character's plot. And in SNOW WHITE IN HAPPILY EVER AFTER, that's the case once again. This time around, the witch's brother, Maliss, has his sights set on Snow White and the Prince. He's been casting wicked spells throughout the kingdom, and it's up to you to stop him and restore peace and happiness to the Kingdom. Playing as either Snow White or Shadowman, you'll have to make your way through eight levels filled with dangerous enemies and challenging gameplay in order to be successful. Luckily, though, you can change the difficulty level if things get too frustrating, and you can continue your game as long as your fingers can stand it with the continuous play feature. There's only one person who can help SNOW WHITE IN HAPPILY EVER AFTER you![CR]http://cheats.ign.com/objects/855/855046.html[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The setting is a steampunk Victorian era England. Baron Fortesque, a grand inventor, has succeeded in his greatest creation yet - the Chaos Engine. Unfortunately (for the rest of the proud kingdom), the Engine then proceeds to both capture and assimilate its creator, then begins to change the countryside for the worse. Vile monsters and destructive automata appear everywhere, bringing the citizens to the verge of panic. This lures a number of mercenaries on a potentially rewarding quest to find the root of the problem and swiftly bring a full stop to it.[CR]The player(s) choose two mercenaries from the group of six to take on the task of defeating the mad Baron Fortesque and the Chaos Engine itself. In one-player mode, the computer artificial intelligence controls the second player (in a co-operative fashion), so that one never has to fight the chaos alone.[CR]The predetermined weapons of the six "heroes" are as follows:[CR]The Cannon (Navvie) and the Rifle (Brigand) act like like a powerful forward shot. At their full power both weapons will have a tight 4 bullet spread.[CR]The Shotgun (Thug) and the Machine Gun (Mercenary) are similar to one another. The shot gun has a wider spread, shoots more bullets in one go but and a slower rate of fire. The Machine gun however has a continuous fire rate and closer spread.[CR]The Pistol (Gentleman) and the Lightening Gun (Preacher) are different to the other weapons. They do not fire bullets, except they have their own "shots," exclusive to each other. They both pass through monsters which in turn can cause damage to any monster or spawn device behind it. The Pistol's Flame shot can be upgraded to fire two shots at once where as the Lightning Gun's Lightning will only have one shot that eventually grows to a larger size.[CR]Sub-Weapons/items can also be bought in the shop, as well as stats and lives, after every 2 stages. Each character will have one Sub-weapon/items each at the start. Only 2 Sub-weapons/items can be held at one time (one for each character) which, in 1 player mode, can be swapped by pressing the space bar. Holding down the fire button activates a Sub-weapon/items.[CR]Sub-weapons/items include screen clearing sticks of dynamite, Bombs, Maps, First Aid Boxes, Molotov Cocktails and 8 way bursts of bullets. Items will similar effects are found in game as well.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Gain Extra Money[CR]After you bet a certain level you gain a password.[CR]Example: A1B2C3D4E5F6[CR]After receiving a level password simply re-enter the code but put the last 6 characters in reverse.[CR]Example: A1B2C36F5E4D[CR]Level Passwords:[CR]W1V19S2SH21Q Level 2 (Brigand and Thug)[CR]C9W18N209ZPW Level 2 (Gentleman and Mercenary)[CR]CJWI9D2QQ2XF Level 2 (Navvie and Scientist)[CR]RI8VDQWF0IVP Level 3 (Brigand and Thug)[CR]RJXVD8WFPIVP Level 3 (Navvie and Scientist)[CR]4I4ILIV4QVX6 Level 4 (Brigand and Thug)[CR]4J3WLPV9XWSC Level 4 (Navvie and Scientist)[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chaos_Engine[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Gain Extra Money[CR]After you bet a certain level you gain a password.[CR]Example: A1B2C3D4E5F6[CR]After receiving a level password simply re-enter the code but put the last 6 characters in reverse.[CR]Example: A1B2C36F5E4D</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The arcade version is famous for using a boxing glove, instead of the classic controller. It's the player's job to hit the target as hard as possible and battles are won by depleting the enemy's health bar. A mechanical, pressure-sensitive, punch pad is used to cushion the blow. The player is allowed 3 hits to do as much damage as needed. The arcade game ran on the Taito B System arcade board.[CR]The SNES home version plays far more like a regular brawler game instead, as it does not have the boxing glove accessory.[CR]Arcade Stages[CR]The game is split over 5 stages:A woman being attacked by a thug.A baby carriage on the freeway, about to be hit by a truck.A group of terrorists controlling a building.A gargantuan crab wrecking havoc on a cruise ship.An asteroid nearing the earth.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Sonic Blast Man II</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sonic Blast Man II is a side-scrolling brawler created by Taito that was released in March 1994 for Japan and November 1994 for the US. It was created by Taito and ITL Co Ltd and published by Taito for the Super Nintendo. It is the console-only sequel to Taito's brawler Sonic Blast Man, and has various new features as well as two new playable characters.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story sets off with Yafu, a being with powerful mental powers, sends on offensive attack on Earth who refers to people of Earth as insects. The superheroes, Captain Choyear, Sonia and of course Sonic Blastman set out to eliminate Yafu and save Earth.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Movement[CR]The game plays similar to Final Fight where a character can move in 8 directions across a plane and can walk/dash from the left to right defeating many different enemies. They can also jump to dodge some types of attacks and also roll out of way. The rolling distance can be controlled by either pressing left or right, the rolling distance covered can either be shortened or widened.Attacking[CR]The player has a primary attack called "Attack 1" where tapping this button will produce a chain combo for the given character and a secondary attack called "Attack 2" which delivers one strong attack.[CR]Jump attacks can be done as well where:Attack 1 would deliver a weak hit to the opponent but can continue the chain combo.Attack 2 would deliver a strong hit that would knockback the opponent.[CR]Special attacks can also be done which deliver a stronger blow but consumes energy. This is done by either pressing L or R buttons, which would make a sound and make the character flash with a black shadow. After pressing Attack 1, it would produce an attack that would hit enemies on line of sight. Pressing Attack 2 however would attack all enemies on the screen with considerable damage to boot.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The player can choose from the 3 superheroes:Sonic Blast ManSoniaCaptain Choyear[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The date is Tuesday, September 13th, 1921.  It's a stormy night, and the luxury ocean liner "Lady Crithania" is about to be capsized by an enormous wave.  Many of its crew and its 2300 passengers will be killed outright in the initial overturning; in the transfigured catastrophic ship environment, most of the remainder will be unable to locate, reach and secure a safe exit from the sinking ship before it floods entirely.  Will you?[CR]Inspired by Paul Gallico's 1969 novel The Poseidon Adventure, this game puts the player in the shoes of one of four denizens of the fated vessel: Capris Wisher, architect; Redwin Gardener, counselor; Luke Haines, sailor; or Jeffrey Howell, doctor.  Each of these gentlemen possess certain exclusive skills and distinct backstories and motivations -- a successful strategy toward winning the game will vary greatly depending on which character you initially select to play.  And just how is the game won?[CR]Here's a hint: don't be on the ship when it goes down for the last time.  Accomplishing this demands mastery of a new skill hitherto untapped by its platform-game spiritual predecessors Prince of Persia and Flashback: exploring and navigating the ship in both an upright and an upside-down position, as well as many of the gradiated permutations between -- thanks to dizzying Mode 7 abuse, the game environment will tip, tilt and skew at predictable (and predictably inconvenient) intervals, granting access to some hitherto unreachable areas (those doors at floor level are of little use when you're on the ceiling!) while denying access to other portions of the ship you perhaps intended to go back through.  You're going to need to recognize where you can and can't -- yet -- reach, and make a note to revisit when the pendulum swings the other way.[CR]You're not going to make it out on your own.  A successful evacuation is going to require the assistance of other survivors.  Supposing you can find ( -- and reach!) them, you're still going to have to safely lead them past obstacles and hazards (as the ship flip-flops on its way to Davy Jones' Locker)... and as with all NPCs, they're slower and less agile than you, necessitating plotting out the simplest, safest course possible (... given the circumstances.)  Which of the endings you conclude with will be determined by who you rescue and how many of them there are -- but I'm sure you'll have your hands full the first few dozen play-throughs just staying alive and trying to figure out how to get to where you're supposed to be going.[CR]Did I mention there's a time limit of one measly hour?  For once, it's your friend; since your injury in this dangerous and unpredictable environment is so frequent and, indeed, inevitable, death has been replaced by a deduction of 5 minutes from the time remaining -- but no matter how safe and dry a hidey-hole you manage to find, when the countdown reaches zero, it's game over.[CR]Hope you packed a towel![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]While playing, press Start to pause the game. Then, in controller 2, hold Select and press R + L. Now, to hear the sounds, press the buttons below:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Unlock The Endings[CR]These are all the possible endings per character. Contrary to what some FAQs say, the endings do not have variations if you rescue certain people. The only person that matters is the hero's loved one. Also, Redwin only has 4 endings instead of 5 (in the USA version at least). This has been confirmed by a script dump of the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Characters Follow You Automatically[CR]To have your rescued passengers follow you automatically, press L or R to make them stand on your spot. Once they do and the arrow turns Red, hold L or R. If done right, the arrow will disappear and the passengers will follow you, even through doors.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Characters Follow You Automatically[CR]After beating the game, after the credits are over, wait 10 seconds at the "Fin" screen and press A to see the time you took and the points worth of passengers you rescued.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Characters Follow You Automatically[CR]To skip your character's long intro, press Select + Start.</plot>

				<title_clean>Soul Blazer</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Soul Blazer (Soul Blader in Japan) is an action adventure RPG developed by Quintet and published by Enix (which is now known as Square Enix). In PAL territories, it was published by Ubisoft. Soul Blazer was developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and was released in Japan, America and in Europe. The player takes the role of an angel, who is sent by "The Master" to destroy the world's monsters and release the people from the captivity of Dark Gaia.[CR]There are eight levels to the game that follow various themes, such as Haunted House, Underwater and Forests.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The Hero (a.k.a. "Blazer") : The protagonist of the game who seeks to restore the world that was locked away by Deathtoll.The Master (a.k.a. "Gaia") :[CR]Guides the protagonist through the world via the Shrine, instructing him on occurring conflicts.Lisa :[CR]Dr. Leo's daughter, who gives the player her fathers old paint brush which allows entrance into Leo's Painting. She is later seen during Magrid Castle as a prisoner.Doctor Leo :[CR]The creator of the many inventions in the game, along with being Lisa's father. He was captured at the beginning of the game by King Magridd's soldiers to build a machine to contact Deathtoll. Afterward, he sacrifices to stop the Queen from killing his daughter.Village Chief :[CR]The chief of Grass Valley who was sealed in Leo's painting by Metal Mantis to prevent the collection of the brown stone.Guardian of the Forest :[CR]The overseer of Green Wood, imprisoned by Deathtoll sealing the green stone within the roots.Mermaid Queen :[CR]Ruler of the underwater city of Oceania - she guards over all aquatic forms in the sea.GEM Fairy :[CR]Helpful fairies that guide the player throughout the game. They are imprisoned in jewels, but if players get near one, they will appear and talk to them, providing helpful information and allowing the hero to teleport back to towns.[CR]Death Toll : The demon who imprisoned everyone in the world. Not much else is know about him other then the fact his intentions are evil.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mechanics[CR]Soul Blazer shares concepts with many other top-down action-adventure games or action-RPGs. There is a mixed emphasis on directly-controlled combat; linear "exploration"; item collection; light puzzle-solving and NPC interaction.[CR]In combat, the player character is capable of movement in four cardinal directions--no diagonal movement--and can attack in those same directions. His sword slash, which is the primary means of attack, has a wide range that can even reach enemies behind him and to the side (though not directly behind him). As in The Legend of Zelda: A Link To the Past, he can also hold his sword out straight in front of him for a "thrust" attack that will damage any enemy directly in front of him. (This deals significantly less damage than the regular sword slash.) In this stance (achieved by holding down one of the SNES shoulder buttons), the hero continues to face the same direction--but can move in all directions.[CR]Neither the hero, nor enemies, stagger back when hit. This makes it possible for the player to deal many successive blows to an enemy without having to move. This also prevents the player from ever being knocked into another enemy attack, helping to avoid the helpless pinballing situation that is occasionally encountered in other games--such as Ninja Gaiden, for one. But it's also possible for a player who is focused on the offensive to lose track of just how many times s/he is getting hit and come dangerously close to being defeated.[CR]The hero is also capable of attacking with different magic spells that are gradually obtained at specific points throughout his journey. A wizard who is encountered almost immediately after the game begins transforms himself into an orb of light that constantly circles around the hero in a fairly wide diameter, and it's from this orb that the magical attacks manifest. As such, it can be very challenging to land a successful hit with a magical attack. Each magical attack consumes a certain amount of GEMs, which can be accumulated through pickups left behind by slain enemies.[CR]Defeated enemies reward the player with experience points, the quantity of which are displayed in small numbers as each enemy is slain. As experience points are amassed, so are experience levels; each level-up results in an additional hit point, as well as either an increase in attack strength; an increase in defensive power; or both. The hero will also acquire new weapons and armor that will provide even more offensive and defensive boosts, respectively.Gameplay Loop[CR]Per the plot of Soul Blazer, the hero's main task is to liberate souls--humans, plants, and animals alike--to reconstruct or repopulate areas of the world made barren by the villain. This mission is laid out such that each of the game's main areas is divided into two main zones: one which is combat-free and one in which combat is the primary concern.[CR]Each combat-free zone--or town, if one prefers--starts out almost empty, with only a single sentient being and a direct path into a combat zone.[CR]Once in the combat zone, which can be one of a variety of types of areas (outskirts, the ocean floor, dungeons, shrines), the hero must defeat enemies which spawn out of generators or lairs--similar to those found in the Gauntlet series. The generators themselves are indestructible by direct hits--they are eliminated only when the player has defeated all of the enemies that they had to offer.[CR]Once eliminated, the generator leaves behind a glowing switch that--when stepped upon--will either liberate one of the souls that used to live in the corresponding town, or open up a path for the hero to delve further into the combat zone. In the case of the former, the player may choose to go back to town to interact with the newly-freed soul or continue fighting deeper into the combat zone. However, the player will eventually come to a roadblock in the combat zone that requires him to return to town to interact with the appropriate soul, who will either remove the obstacle outright or give the hero an item with which he can remove the obstacle himself.[CR]Certain town interactions require the player to do more than simply talk to the soul; frequently, the player is asked to find and deliver an item before he will be assisted. In other instances, the hero must use a special item to enter the dreams of sleeping town inhabitants to gather clues on how to surmount the roadblock. Others, still, require the hero to follow around a particular inhabitant about town.[CR]Each town offers a way to obtain a medical herb (a single-use item, of which only one can be carried, useful for automatically replenishing hit points when the player has been completely drained) and safe passage to the main hub where the hero can save the game, take a shortcut to teleport pads unlocked in the combat zone, or move to another town entirely. Thus, the player may find him or herself directing the hero from combat back to town frequently to restock on medical herbs and save the game.[CR]As the hero fights deeper and deeper into the combat zone, the town will gradually grow back to its former glory, and if all the required roadblocks have been eliminated in the combat zone, the player will be able to access the boss character of the combat zone. Once defeated, the area is cleared, and the player may move onto the next town in the game. The combat zone remains open, however, and the player can thusly return to previously-visited zones in order to kill certain enemies that require advanced equipment to defeat.[CR]Enemy generators do not respawn; in fact, only a scant few enemies--that don't come from generators--respawn. As such, the hero does not need to wade through hordes of the same enemies he already defeated, making repeated trips into the combat zone a bit easier to swallow. However, this also makes level-grinding a difficult endeavor until or unless the player finds one of the few-and-far-between patches of respawning enemies to slay. If the player is diligent about destroying all enemy generators in the non-combat zone before encountering the boss (note that some generators are not mandatory to destroy), it's almost impossible for the hero to be "underleveled" for a boss encounter.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When released Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the following scores, 8,9,8,8 adding, "A great action/adventure cart that's loaded with great graphics and sounds and a long quest. The game is fast and the pace is just right if you need a little action with your role-playing. The quest is a little easier than I expected and can be solved in a few hours. Great music and visuals keep you coming back for more".[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Space Ace</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Space Ace was Don Bluth's less-successful follow up to Dragon's Lair. Much of the same development team from Dragon's Lair worked on Space Ace, and the arcade cabinet utilized the same Laserdisc technology. For Space Ace, Bluth set out to push the Laserdisc technology beyond what he had previously showcased in Dragon's Lair, primarily by making greater use of its random-access abilities to create numerous branching pathways. Instead of building one linear sequence, and killing the player if they missed an action, the game could often incorporate a "miss" into its narrative and continue on.[CR]Just as was tried with the randomization of sequences in Dragon's Lair, the idea was that a player could have a different experience on the second, third, or even tenth play - in this case, checking out content they missed in the previous play. Space Ace was also designed to have a greater emphasis on story and characterization. To this point, unlike in Dragon's Lair, all the scenes happen in a specific order, with the occasional branching opportunities appearing within. This was done to address the "collection of disjointed scenes" criticism of Dragon's Lair.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Kimberly and Ace.[CR]The player controls the titular Space Ace on the trail of an evil alien mastermind named Borf. Borf has developed a new weapon, the "Infanto Ray", which he intends to use to enslave the population of Earth. While scouting Borf's space station, Ace's gal, Kimberly, is kidnapped and Ace himself is hit with the Infanto Ray. The ray transforms him into a lanky kid named Dexter, and leaves him in a state of fluctuating between these two forms.[CR]The player must fly, shoot, and dodge their way through Borf's lair, save Kimberly, reverse the effects of the Infanto Ray, and put a stop to Borf's plans for good.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] is essentially identical to what was introduced in Dragon's Lair. The player has a joystick to select directions, and a "Shoot" button to perform actions. Animation plays up to a decision point, at which time the player has a second or less to react before the game will branch to a new path, or Ace will lose a life.[CR]Sections of the animation will quickly flash yellow to indicate both when and how the player should react. If a door on the left flashes, the player should flick the stick left to travel through the door. The action Ace will take after a successful move is often unpredictable, with the intention being that Ace's antics will surprise and entertain the player. If the player misses an action that results in death, they lose a life from their stock of 3 and must restart at the beginning of that section.[CR]Space Ace's main hook is its transforming protagonist. The player defaults to Dexter, whose cannot use a weapon, and whose sections are therefore based around dodging and avoiding hazards. Numerous times throughout the adventure, the player will get the option to "Energize". If they press the Shoot button in time, Dexter will transform into Ace, a muscular hero who can use his laser pistol to blast through enemies. Due to the branching pathway technology, if the player does not transform into Ace, they will often continue on an altered path as Dexter.[CR]Space Ace also introduced difficulty levels (Cadet, Captain, and Ace) whereas Dragon's Lair had only one. The difficulty levels were intended to make the game accessible to a wider audience, however, this was achieved by simply skipping over the more difficult sections. Nearly half the available scenes are playable on Cadet, and roughly 2/3rds on Captain, forcing players to master the Ace difficulty to see all the content.[CR]Presentation[CR]As with Dragon's Lair, hand-drawn cell animation was used running at 24 frames a second - the same as with an animated feature film. Colors were vibrant and detail unsurpassed by anything standard arcade hardware (or computers) could generate or display. A few of the sequences used models for rotoscoping, namely the spaceships, motorcycle, and tunnel and rocket skates scenes.[CR]Dragon's Lair's Chris Stone provided the soundtrack, this time more theatrical, continuous, and now recorded and presented in stereo. Space Ace features more dialogue than Dragon's Lair, so Bluth's studio did look for professional voice talent. In the end, to save money, they decided again to pull voices from within the studio. The sole professional voice talent is Michael Rye, reprising his role from Dragon's Lair as the game's narrator.Space Ace - Jeff Etter (animator)Dexter - Will Finn (animator/story)Kimberley - Lorna Pomeroy (animator)Borf - Don Bluth[CR]Versions[CR]Atari ST version.[CR]Initial ports were for home computers, and shipped on multiple floppy disks. The Laserdisc's cell animation was redrawn with less detail into computer sprites, and many levels reworked or redesigned to accommodate the hardware. Cutscenes were removed due to space limitations, so nearly all sequences cut sharply to the next, without transitions. Branching pathways are also removed, with some scenes altered and made more linear (for example, Dexter doesn't need to change to Ace to shoot the pistol).SNES version[CR]The Super NES received the only console port of that generation, and replicated the arcade Laserdisc's vibrant colors with some success. However, gameplay is the most radically revised for this version - becoming essentially a platform title with new shooting sequences. Scenes are redesigned or invented for this version, with a focus on side-scrolling mechanics, and the player now controls Dexter/Ace fully at all times instead of making decisions at key points. Platform hopping and top-down shooting make up the basic gameplay here.Sega CD version.[CR]With the advent of CD-ROM based consoles, ports of the original Laserdisc game made the rounds with varying degrees of quality. The Sega CD release naturally featured the most compressed video, but the gameplay was largely intact. Modern releases, such as for iOS, use advanced video compression to the same effect. Digital Leisure also released a DVD version of the game, playable in most home DVD players by using the arrow keys on the remote. A similar Blu-Ray release of Space Ace and Dragon's Lair was completed in 2008.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Though Don Bluth set out to make a game that surpassed Dragon's Lair as a true showcase of animation, most arcade owners weren't impressed. Ace's increased difficulty level was cited as a problem, as was the decision to originally only offer Space Ace as a new cabinet (rather than a conversion kit). Space Ace also had the misfortune of hitting in the center of the 1983-84 video game crash, when consumer interest in the entire industry was noticeably suffering.[CR]Owners also seemed less interested in a different, but similar, game to the original Dragon's Lair as they were in an actual sequel for it. Bluth's studio would go on to put the advancements made in Ace to use in Dragon's Lair II.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Theatrical-style poster for Space Ace.Don Bluth decided to market Space Ace in a way that was new to arcade owners, but tried-and-true in the movie business - designing extensive press books and press kits to promote the game in the same way as a feature film. Theatrical movie posters were even printed up and distributed to arcade owners.The game often contradicts itself as to whether Dexter is a young Ace (and his real name), or a separate character. Kimberly occasionally calls Ace "Dexter", supporting the former, while the intro attract mode suggests Ace is trapped inside a kid's (Dexter's) body.[CR]System Requirements (Steam Release)[CR]PCMinimumOS: Windows XP SP3Processor: 1.8 GHz dual core CPUMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: 256 MB GeForce 8800, Radeon 3850, or Intel HD 2000 GraphicsDirectX&#174;: 9.0Hard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX Compatible Sound CardRecommendedOS: Windows 7Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo at 2.2 GHz, or AMD Athlon 64 at 2.2 GHzMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: 512 MB GeForce 220, Radeon 4550, Intel HD 3000 GraphicsDirectX&#174;: 9.0Hard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceSound: DirectX Compatible Sound CardMacMinimumOS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8, or laterProcessor: Intel Core Duo ProcessorMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: Intel HD3000 or better card with at least 256 MB VRAMHard Drive: 1 GB HD spaceRecommendedOS: Snow Leopard 10.6.8, or laterProcessor: Intel Core i Series ProcessorMemory: 1 GB RAMGraphics: Intel HD3000 or better card with at least 256 MB VRAMHard Drive: 1 GB HD space[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In the futuristic sports game Space Football, 2 players steering hovercrafts try to score touchdowns on each other by picking up and carrying a hoverball into a touchdown area. The hovercraft has the ability to accelerate, reverse, track the hoverball, and it can also fire at the opposing player to make him drop the ball if he's carrying it. If the player's hovercraft picks up the hoverball, they must try to get to the touchdown area within four seconds or else the hoverball gets automatically fumbled. Each game is played for a duration of 500 time units and the player with the highest score when the time runs out is declared the winner.[CR]The playfield itself presents features that can affect the way the match is played. Some playfields contain things such as jumps, spinners, and force arrows which can help or hinder a players movement. [CR]There are a total of 12 drivers to choose from, with 4 per every speed level (slow, medium, and high).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Passwords[CR]Enter these at the password screen:</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]One of the earliest shooting games, Space Invaders was released by Taito in Japan on June 19, 1978. Gameplay involves attempting to defeat waves of aliens cascading down from the top of the screen with a laser cannon that moves along a fixed horizontal axis. The only goal is to earn as many points as possible. Designer Tomohiro Nishikado was in charge of planning, graphic design, and programming for the game and drew creative inspiration from such diverse sources as Gun Fight, Breakout, The War of the Worlds, and Star Wars. The game&#8217;s development cycle lasted for one year, during which Nishikado created custom hardware and software. The game achieved massive popularity upon its release (leading to a temporary shortage of one hundred yen coins in Japan), and helped usher in the golden age of arcade video games (circa 1978-1984).[CR]Space Invaders sold over 400,000 arcade cabinets worldwide and grossed around $3.8 billion in revenue by 1982, equivalent to over $13 billion in 2014, making it the highest-grossing video game of all time.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arcade (cabaret/cocktail) version[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in Space Invaders is relatively simple. The player controls a small ship that can only move laterally across the bottom of the screen and fires vertically. Five rows of eleven aliens each advance slowly from one side of the screen to the other, dropping down one space and reversing direction when they reach either side. The player&#8217;s task is to acquire points by eliminating enemies and to destroy all of the aliens before they reach the bottom of the screen and complete their &#8220;invasion.&#8221; As aliens are destroyed, the speed of the remaining enemies increases, as does the tempo of the music. Once all of the enemies are destroyed, the wave resets and the difficulty increases (a cycle that can continue indefinitely).[CR]The Invaders constantly shoot back at the player as they advance from side to side across the screen. To help avoid their attacks, the player can hide behind a number of destructible barriers or &#8220;bunkers&#8221; near the bottom of the screen (four in the original version). Occasionally a &#8220;mystery ship&#8221; will appear near the top of the screen and move quickly from one side to the other while making a distinctive klaxon noise. Destroying it rewards the player with a sizeable point bonus.[CR]Development[CR]While working for the Taito Corporation, designer Nishikado was inspired to create Space Invaders by an early Taito electro-mechanical game called Space Monsters, and by the Atari arcade game Breakout. The game was planned to have tanks, planes, and battleships as enemies, but Nishikado was not happy with their onscreen movements. He considered making the enemies human (which would have been easier to animate), but scrapped the idea since he thought it would be immoral for players to shoot them. After he saw a magazine featuring the 1977 film Star Wars, he decided to use a space theme, and based his alien enemies on the squid-like antagonists from the 1953 movie version of The War of the Worlds.Upright cabinet[CR]Due to the limitations of 1970s microprocessors, Nishikado was forced to design and build his own hardware and development tools. The arcade board he put together contained a variety of both Japanese and American components. It used an Intel 8080 central processing unit (designed by American and Japanese engineers), which could output raster graphics on a CRT monitor, but was slow when it came to drawing sprite graphics, so a dedicated Fujitsu MB14241 video shifter (an early example of a graphics chip) was used to accelerate the drawing of sprite graphics to a bitmap framebuffer. Monaural sound was hosted by a combination of analogue circuitry and a Texas Instruments SN76477 sound chip. The system that he put together is now known as the Taito 8080 arcade system board.[CR]In spite of his efforts, Nishikado was unable to program the game exactly as he wanted. The hardware that he had assembled was not powerful enough to display graphics in color and the enemies moved slower than he had intended. Fortunately he discovered that the more enemies that were removed from play, the faster the processor could render those that remained. Rather than attempt to design the game to compensate for the speed increase, he opted to leave it in as a challenging gameplay mechanic.[CR]It was originally released in Japan by Taito as a cocktail cabinet, with monochrome graphics enhanced by a rainbow-colored cellophane overlay to simulate color graphics. Taito and American licence-holder Bally/Midway then created an upright cabinet that used strips of orange and green cellophane applied to the screen to simulate color graphics, though this version only simulated several colors (compared to Taito's original cocktail version simulating a wider range of colors). Both the Japanese and American upright cabinets also included a painted backdrop of a lunar surface and a starscape, and cabinet art featuring large humanoid creatures that bore little resemblance to the in-game enemies. Nishikado claims that this was due to the artist basing his interpretation on the game&#8217;s original title, Space Monsters.[CR]Impact and Legacy[CR]Soon after its release in Japan, Space Invaders became a huge success, completely taking over certain arcades and earning Taito a tidy profit. By the end of 1978, Taito had installed 100,000 machines across the country and grossed over $600 million dollars. An oft-quoted urban legend states that there was a shortage of 100-yen coins&#8212;and subsequent production increase&#8212;in Japan attributed to the game. By 1980, 300,000 cabinets had been sold in Japan and an additional 60,000 in the United States. By 1981, Space Invaders had made Taito more than $1 billion, and continued to gross an average of $600 million per year, through to 1982, by which time it had grossed $2 billion in quarters (equivalent to $4.6 billion in 2011). This made it the best-selling video game and highest-grossing entertainment product of its time, surpassing the then highest-grossing film Star Wars, which had grossed $486 million in movie tickets.Atari 2600 version[CR]The 1980 Atari 2600 version represented the first official licensed port of an arcade game to a home console, and and became the first "killer app" for video game consoles by quadrupling sales of the 2600. It sold over two million units in its first year on sale as a home console game, becoming the first title to sell over a million cartridges. Ports were also released for the Atari 8-bit computer line and the Atari 5200, as well as the Nintendo Entertainment System, Game Boy and SNES. Numerous unofficial clones were made as well, such as the popular computer games Super Invader (1979) and TI Invaders (1981).[CR]Game designer Shigeru Miyamoto considered Space Invaders a game that revolutionized the video game industry; he was never interested in video games before seeing it. Hideo Kojima also described it as the first video game that impressed him and got him interested in video games. Several publications ascribed the expansion of the video game industry from a novelty into a global industry to the success of the game. Edge magazine attributed the shift of video games from bars and arcades to more mainstream locations like restaurants and department stores to Space Invaders. Its popularity was such that it was the first game where an arcade machine's owner could make up for the cost of the machine in under one month, or in some places within one week.[CR]Technology journalist Jason Whittaker credited the game's success to ending the video game crash of 1977, which had earlier been caused by Pong clones flooding the market, and beginning the golden age of video arcade games.According to The Observer, the home console versions were popular and encouraged users to learn programming; many who later became industry leaders. 1UP stated that Space Invaders showed that video games could compete against the major entertainment media at the time: movies, music, and television IGN attributed the launch of the arcade phenomenon in North America in part to Space Invaders. Electronic Games credited the game's success as the impetus behind video gaming becoming a rapidly growing hobby and as "the single most popular coin-operated attraction of all time." Game Informer considered it, along with Pac-Man, one of the most popular arcade games that tapped into popular culture and generated excitement during the golden age of arcades.IGN listed it as one of the "Top 10 Most Influential Games" in 2007, citing the source of inspiration to video game designers and the impact it had on the shooting genre. 1UP ranked it at No. 3 in its list of "The 60 Most Influential Games of All Time," stating that, in contrast to earlier arcade games which "were attempts to simulate already-existing things," Space Invaders was "the first video game as a video game, instead of merely a playable electronic representation of something else." In 2008, Guinness World Records listed it as the top-rated arcade game in technical, creative, and cultural impact.[CR]As one of the earliest shooting games, it set precedents and helped pave the way for future titles and for the shooting genre. Space Invaders popularized a more interactive style of gameplay with the enemies responding to the player controlled cannon's movement, and was the first video game to popularize the concept of achieving a high score, being the first to save the player's score. While earlier shooting games allowed the player to shoot at targets, Space Invaders was the first in which targets could fire back at the player. It was also the first game where players were given multiple lives, had to repel hordes of enemies, could take cover from enemy fire, and use destructible barriers,in addition to being the first game to use a continuous background soundtrack, with four simple diatonic descending bass notes repeating in a loop, which was dynamic and changed pace during stages, like a heartbeat sound that increases pace as enemies approached.[CR]It also introduced the concept of a difficulty curve, with the aliens moving faster as the player kills more of them, making the game more difficult as it progresses. The game's concept of scaling difficulty became the basis for modern single-player video gaming.[CR]Cited by influential creators like Shigeru Miyamoto and Hideo Kojima as a major inspiration, Space Invaders revolutionized the industry following the video game crash of 1977 (brought on by a glut of Pong clones on the market and the departure of manufacturers like RCA and Fairchild). Proving that video games were capable of competing with movies, music and television, Space Invaders has since become recognized as one of the most influential games ever released. It was one of the first games to utilize the concept of a &#8220;high score,&#8221; and was the first to save the player&#8217;s score. It was the first shooter that allowed enemies to shoot back at the player, the first to give the player multiple lives and provide destructible cover against enemy fire. Its success effectively launched an entire genre of space shooters, including Atari&#8217;s Asteroids, Williams&#8217; Defender, and Namco&#8217;s Galaxian series.[CR]It moved the gaming industry away from Pong-inspired sports games grounded in real-world situations towards action games involving fantastical situations. Whittaker commented that Space Invaders helped action games become the most dominant genre on both arcades and consoles, through to contemporary times. Guinness World Records considered Space Invaders one of the most successful arcade shooting games by 2008. In describing it as a "seminal arcade classic", IGN listed it as the number eight "classic shoot 'em up". Space Invaders set the template for the shoot 'em up genre. Its worldwide success created a demand for a wide variety of science fiction games, inspiring the development of arcade games, such as Atari's Asteroids, Williams Electronic's Defender, and Namco's Galaxian and Galaga, which were modeled after Space Invaders' gameplay and design. This influence extends to most shooting games released to the present day, including first-person shooters such as Wolfenstein, Doom, Halo, and Call of Duty. Space Invaders also had an influence on early computer dungeon crawl games such as Dungeons of Daggorath, which used similar heartbeat sounds to indicate player health. Space Invaders' concept of a gradually increasing difficulty level also revolutionized the gaming industry.Remakes and sequelsSpace Invaders '95, one of many sequels[CR]Recent ports and remakes include Space Invaders Anniversary, released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 and including nine variants of the core game. Space Invaders, Space Invaders Part II and Return of the Invaders were featured in the arcade compilation Taito Legends (released in 2005), and Space Invaders '91, Space Invaders '95, and Space Invaders DX were featured in Taito Legends 2 (released in 2006). A remake of the game called Space Invaders Extreme was released for the PSP and Nintendo DS in 2008 and on Xbox Live Arcade in 2009. A second remake, Space Invaders Infinity Gene, was released in 2009 on PlayStation Network, Xbox Live Arcade, and iOS devices.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Demo Mode Codes[CR]Wait until the game goes into a Demo when you reset, then enter the code.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Space Megaforce, or Super Aleste as it is known in Europe and Japan, is a Compile shoot 'em up and the first Super Nintendo entry in the Aleste series.[CR]The player can collect up to eight different types of weapons, each of which can be powered up a maximum of six times. Each of these power levels causes each weapon to act differently, from causing more damage to shooting extra bullets and missiles. The player powers up a weapon by collecting small colored spheres. Orange spheres add towards a level up, but as the weapon gets stronger it takes more orange spheres to go up the next level. There are also rarer green spheres that will instantly level up the weapon.[CR]The 8 different weapons are obtained by collecting a circle with a number on it. From Weapon 1 to 8, the names are: Multiple Shot, Laser, Multi-Directional Shot, Missile, Circle, Power Shot, Scatter and Sprite. Smart bombs are also included in the game, killing almost everything on screen when activated.[CR]The player's health is based on their weapon level. When the player's ship is hit, it loses 4 levels of power, so the player would need a weapon level of 5 or above to survive a hit from projectiles. The player cannot be damaged by hitting walls or obstacles - only enemies. It is possible to be crushed between two obstacles if caught between them, however.[CR]The Japanese version has a few additional features. These include an actual conclusion to the story, a menu screen with more options and super deformed art on the menu and game over screen's background.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded it their "Editor's Choice Gold Award and the scores: 8,9,9,9. From the review, "...the best shooter ever made for any home system to date! Where other games struggle to get six levels in a game, Toho does twelve! No slowdown, great Mode 7 and Decent music make this an almost perfect game".[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra ending scenes[CR]This only works in the Japanese version of the game.[CR]To get an extra ending scene, press the L and R buttons after the credits are over. If done correctly the screen will change to the extra scene instead of restarting back to the intro. There's an extra scene on each difficulty level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra ending scenes[CR]On the main menu, press Select twice and hold it. The option selection should be highlighted. Press Start. During game play, the last digit of the score will indicate the level of danger, with zero displaying for low danger areas to seven for high danger areas.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Spanky's Quest is a 2D puzzle platformer developed by Natsume and published by Taito for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in July 1992.[CR]Originally released in Japan in December 27, 1991 (as Hansei Zaru Jirou-kun no Daibouken, translated to Monkey Reflections: The Adventures of Mr. Jiro), players control an anthropomorphic monkey kid (named Spanky), who must journey through six towers to defeat an evil witch and return home. To do this, he must unlock doors (with keys found scattered throughout levels) while eliminating hostile anthropomorphic fruits and vegetables by various sports balls conjured by popping colored bubbles thrown by him. He can also collect hats (as single-level powerups) which grant different abilities.[CR]The handheld version, released for the Game Boy, was originally released in Japan (as Lucky Monkey) on April 26, 1991 (and released in North America at the same time as the SNES version). Unlike the SNES version, there are no keys or hats to pick up (and the concept of attacking with sports balls was changed to "bubble blasts"). However, players can collect bonus pickups (giving more score, collected for each enemy eliminated) and special "letter" pickups (either S, P, A, N, K, or Y, collected by eliminating more than one enemy with the same bubble blast). Collecting each of the six pickups immediately sends the player to the bonus stage.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sparkster and its prequel,  Rocket Knight Adventures, were released at that time in the nineties when tons of mascot based platformer games were being released. Like many of those competitors, Sparkster is a 2D platformer starring an anthropomorphic animal. The twist in this game is Sparkster's rocket pack, which can be used to fly around the level in eight directions for short bursts. Sparkster's quality and pedigree as a Konami game helped ensure it would be more memorable than  Bubsy or  Aero the Acro-Bat ever were.[CR]Sparkster is not to be confused with Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2, which was a direct sequel to the original Rocket Knight Adventures exclusive to the Genesis/Mega Drive. The US/EU version of Rocket Knight Adventures 2 is known as just Sparkster, making it easy to confuse with this SNES spin-off.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Sparkster controls like a typical 2D platformer. Many areas feature thin ledges that can be grabbed by Sparkster's prehensile tail and climbed around on. A regular attack with the sword also launches a projectile across the screen, and holding down the button after attacking will charge the rocket pack, which takes about a second. Once charged, holding a direction and releasing the button will send Sparkster shooting away. While dashing with the rocket pack Sparkster will ricochet wildly off walls, floors and ceilings, which is sometimes the only way to reach a certain area. Sparkster can also use a flip move by pressing the R and L buttons, which will cause Sparkster to quickly flip right or left. This can be done in mid air and is a great way to get around, but using it too many times in a row makes Sparkster dizzy and unable to move for a while.[CR]In addition, Sparkster has a few unique levels that switch up the gameplay. There's a level where Sparkster pilots giant mechanical ostriches, which run automatically. He can fire ripple laser shots from the bird's mouth and make it go up and down to grab crystals as it speeds by. Towards the end of the game, there is a section where the player controls the game as a top-down shooter. That level's boss fight involves piloting a fighting mech, which is controlled by pressing the R and L buttons to punch with the respective hand.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Crazy Hard Mode[CR]Pause the game and press A, B, X, Y, L, R.  Unpause and sparkster wont take any damage from hits.  To reverse the code just pause the game and put it in again.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] End Passwords[CR]At the title screen select password and attack the empty boxes to change them.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;A: Apple B: Banana C: Crystal N: Nothing&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;T: top row M: middle row B: bottom row[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Raise Score To Desired Point by Defeating Infinite Enemies[CR]In the first level inside the ship, proceed until you're past the wooden crate walls, which you broke through with your rocket. When ricocheting off walls toward the end of the level (before the boss), there should be a space inside the wall on the right. Jump in and walk in. If you're in the right place, you should find some sort of wooden wall built into the stage wall. Charge into it to break it, and an explosion will show up. Infinite enemies will spawn from the explosions. Maintain a distance from them, face the explosion, and press the attack button repeatedly to kill enemies the second the spawn. Kill enemies until desired score is reached.</plot>

				<title_clean>Spectre</title_clean>
				<plot>Spectre is a 3D shooter where the player drives a little red car/tank and blasts away enemies.  The gameplay is similar to Battlezone, and obviously inspired by it.[CR]There is a selection of three tanks, each with three values (speed; armor; and firepower) balanced out to match its name: Tough Guy is heavy on armor, but slow and not very powerful; Speedy is fast, but low armor; and Balanced combines both strengths, but decreased. A fourth tank allows the player to design a custom variant.[CR]Every level consists of a large plane filled with enemy tanks, several psychedelic walls with odd images that often flicker or warp resembling an acid trip, and tacky 3D models like windmills.  The object of each level is to either destroy all the enemy tanks in the level, or to collect all the flags. Every level has a certain theme to it, anything from plain green to a colorful blinking eye or images of sand dunes are to be found on the walls, windmills and flags throughout the level.[CR]With every passing level, enemy tanks grow smarter and their rates of fire increases.  Also in later levels, new, smarter, more powerful enemy tanks join the skirmish. The player has a limited amount of ammo, but driving over ammo deposits replenishes a small amount of ammunition, as well as driving over shield deposits grants additional shields. The three different views (first, third, and top-down) allow the player to incorporate additional strategies into the battles.[CR]The game boasts having supposedly an infinite amount of levels, though anything after level 80 is almost instant death.  A high score table is also included.[CR]An additional note-worthy feature of this game is the multi-player mode. Up to eight players are supported over IPX, or NetBios (or two via modem or serial port). The network option offers three Cyberspace Scenarios: Arena - free-for-all battles, get one point for each opponent destroyed.[CR]Flag Rally - a match point given for collecting six flags, destroy someone to get any flags being carried.[CR]Base Raid - Akin to "capture the flag".  Two teams, two bases; get match point for destroying opponent base.[CR]The CD-ROM manual includes a "Cyberpunk story", to give background information on the game which consisted of a cyberjock named Hart who lived for the battles in the Arena.</plot>

				<title_clean>SpellCraft - Aspects of Valor</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]      In Spellcraft, you play as Robert, an average man who has been transported to the land of Valoria.  It all begins when you receive a letter from an old relative asking you to travel to England and meet him at Stonehenge.  From there, you are conscripted by the wizard Garwayen to help save the world.          Valoria is a semi-standard fantasy setting, with magic, orcs, dragons, and so on.  It deviates from the norm in its handling of the elements, though, including Ether and Mind along with the standard Earth, Air, Water, Fire elements. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]      Most of the action takes place in the different realms (Earth, Air, Water, Fire, Ether, Mind, and Death).   Here, the player controls Robert in an     isometric setting, similar to (though pre-dating)    Diablo.  It's not the same click-happy design, though, relying more on thoughtful setup rather than furious mouse and keyboard action.  The game was somewhat forgiving here, teleporting the player to the Death Realm if they died in one of the higher realms.  This game the player a chance to fight his way back.       The time spent outside of the different realms is spent in the workshop, where the player can use different items to create new spells, or simply tweak existing ones.  The game truly shows its age here with regards to the diffiulty curve.  While combining the right aspects can make powerful spells, slight deviations from these recipes often results in an   instant kill.  This is made all the more dangerous by the fact that recipes are rarely, if ever, spelled out openly.  In what may be viewed as an extremely devious form of copy protection, the knowledge needed to craft the spells could only be obtained via reading the manual for clues and paying close attention to the characters in the game. The game struck an interesting balance.  If the player was more interested in the combat aspects, it could be played almost solely as a fantasy combat game.  However, if the player wanted to develop more strategy, some of the intensely powerful spells could make the combat a breeze, if only they could be discovered.  [CR]Spell Types[CR]Rather than having your standard set of spells, the game focused on having a variety of combinations, allowing the player to progress in their own style.  To begin, the player must choose a specific element to be an adept of, either Earth, Air, Water, Fire, Mind, or Ether.  Note that Death is not an available choice.  Above and beyond that, there are specific types of spells that can be crafted.  There are the straightforward Attack Spells and Defense Spells, then Personal Modifier Spells, Terrain Modifier Spells, Transformation Spells, and Conjuration Spells.  [CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]The game was largely unnoticed, garnering only a single review in Dragon, issue #190.  It was a favorable review, being rated four out of five stars, but this did little to bolster sales.[CR]Versions[CR]All of the above is based on the PC version.  Asciiware attempted to port the game to the  SNES, and decided to focus almost solely on the fantasy combat aspect.  The game was canceled before its release, even though it was quite far along.  There are rumored to be a few pre-released cartridges in existence, but these are desirable only as collector's items.  The quality of the game was largely lost in the porting process.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Spider-Man - Venom - Maximum Carnage</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage is the video game adaptation of the comic book arc of the same name. In this brawler the player controls Spider-Man or Venom as they join forces against the psychopathic Carnage.[CR]The game structure is divided by stages and each stage may be side or top-down scroller. For the majority of them, the player can move the character on a Z-Axis, as seen with classic games like Golden Axe or Final Fight.[CR]The gameplay involves a lot of button mashing for getting combos and sending the enemies to the void. There's no character upgrades nor is there any level progression.[CR]The story is told mainly by comic book style cutscenes between stages, that brings to the player the original comic art with some minor animations.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game opens in Ravencroft Asylum, where Cletus Kasady -- a maniacal killer who carries "Carnage", a spawn of the Venom symbiote -- is being escorted to a cell. The Carnage symbiote emerges during the escort, and, after gaining control of Kasady, kills all of the guards in the complex. Carnage meets Shriek, a woman with the ability to manipulate sound into concussive blasts, and they gather a "family" of villains -- including Doppelganger (a six-armed Spider-Man look-alike whose mask is adorned with gruesome teeth and whose web is made of barbed wire), Demogoblin (a demon that bears likeness to the Hobgoblin), and Carrion (a man infected with a virus that grants him the ability to turn organic matter into ash). With their group assembled, the "family" begins a killing spree in New York, the likes of which have never been seen.[CR]Spider-Man, seeing the effect Carnage's crusade is having on the thug community of New York, tries to stop the riots in the streets with a hands-on approach that, after a confrontation with Shriek and Doppelganger, nearly kills him. Cloak and Dagger intervene before a vicious gang step in with the killing stroke, and Cloak teleports Spider-Man to a nearby church. Having followed Spider-Man to his temporary resting place, Shriek and Doppelganger attack the trio of heroes, and though they fight valiantly, Carnage announces his presence with authority by stabbing Dagger. Content with the chaos he's created, Carnage leaves the church with his compatriots.[CR]Eddie Brock, the man carrying the "Venom" symbiote, sees the reports of Carnage's rampage in the newspaper the following morning. His anger wells, and Venom imposes itself quickly over Brock's will. Venom devotes himself to reaching New York before Carnage destroys more lives.[CR]Venom arrives in New York to confront Carnage, who is both surprised and quite pleased his symbiotic counterpart has come to join the chaos, but Carnage commits both Shriek and Doppelganger to stop Venom. A brutal battle wages between the three warriors, and Venom's might is admirable, but the combined power of the "family" proves greater than the resolve of the elder symbiote. Knowing defeat, Venom escapes with his life and plants his broken body on the doorstep of Peter Parker.[CR]Carnage allows Demogoblin to begin his assault on Manhattan, and Spider-Man, understanding the gravity of the situation, takes an oath to align himself with Venom in order to stop Kasady's madness. Venom takes on Demogoblin, while Spider-Man fights his way through waves of gang members to reach Carnage's ad hoc headquarters -- a nightclub called "The Deep". Spider-Man's newfound rage leads him through a gauntlet battle against the bulk of Carnage's crew, but when the "family" manages to escape, it becomes duly apparent that a new plan is necessary to unbalance and overthrow Carnage's reign over the fear of the city.[CR]Venom suggests Carnage, despite his heightened strengths, may still be vulnerable to the same weaknesses against which Venom falters. Spider-Man decides to infiltrate the laboratory of Reed Richards to obtain the Fantastic Four's Sonic Gun, as the symbiote only appears weak to sonic sound waves and fire.[CR]After obtaining Richards's sonic gun, the group of heroes (now aided by fire-manipulating Firestar) manage to lure Carnage and his troops to Prospect Park, where a heated battle erupts between all of the heroes. The conflict culminates with the heroes seemingly victorious, and Firestar uses a plume of flames to end Carnage's reign forever. Spider-Man, however, refuses to bring himself to the level of a maniac like Kasady, and orders Firestar to stop before Kasady dies along with the symbiote. Venom grows angry at Spider-Man's empathy and self-righteousness, and provokes Parker into a brawl that escalates into Venom knocking Spider-Man down a steep hill and proclaiming his unending hate for the webslinger. The heroes rush to Spider-Man's aid, leaving Venom alone with Carnage and Shriek, who regain their energy and overwhelm Venom, whisking him away with the Sonic Gun in-hand.[CR]Holding Venom hostage in the Statue of Liberty, Carnage tortures him by holding him above a fire, and shooting him with intermittent blasts from the Sonic Gun, allowing the symbiote to neither dissipate completely nor fully regain its vigor. Spider-Man and ever-increasing cascade of heroes (Captain America now joins the group) continue their push against the "family," but Venom manages to free himself, willing the symbiote to bat the Sonic Gun out of Carnage's hand and escape from the Statue of Liberty. He meets with Spider-Man in the now-riotous streets of Manhattan for a final clash against Shriek and the minions, and they overcome both the "family" and Carnage when he arrives in pursuit of Venom.[CR]Comfortable that Carnage has been dealt with, Spider-Man and Venom have a last interchange in Central Park. Peace washes over New York as the sun rises over the horizon and a serene silence signifies the end of the reign of terror. As the two unlikely heroes begin to part ways, Carnage arises -- nearly completely regenerated -- from the nearby lake to do battle once more. Fearing the conflict has no end, Spider-Man grows weary and edges near defeat, yet the Avengers arrive as Carnage is dealt a final, crushing blow, and it seems certain Carnage will never be free again.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 5 continues[CR]Enter the following on the Start screen with Controller 2.

				<plot>Spider-Man and members of the X-Men have teamed up in this side-scrolling action game to fight against Arcade, who has built a giant amusement park for the sole purpose of trapping and destroying the super-heroes. You first play as Spider-Man, who sees the X-Men get kidnapped by Arcade and follows them. Once you make it inside Arcade's park you can choose to play as Spider-Man, Cyclops, Storm, Gambit, or Wolverine, each of whom are trapped in a different part of Arcade's maze of deadly traps. You must navigate all five of them safely out, using their different skills and abilities while defeating baddies and bosses along the way.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 100 Star Glitch[CR]In Gambits First Stage, when you get to the fourth Green Globe (above the B) on the destroyable steps, try to jump on the step below it. Then try to jump over the globe and the star above it, right off the top of the screen. Try to land on the same spot you jumped from(Its kinda like jump right, but turn left when you go back down). Your stars will increase by about 30-60, depending on how well you can land, but DO NOT touch the Green Globe or the single star above it. Let us remember, 100 stars collect in Gambits Stage can lead to a life. By repeating the procedure over and over, you may build up to 8 or more extra lives before the rolling wheel hits you. If you repeat the procedure enough times, you may build up to 99 lives, where from then on out, you can try to beat everyone elses stage without having to beat Gambits First Stage until later.</plot>

				<title_clean>Spindizzy Worlds</title_clean>
				<plot>On it's most basic level, Spindizzy Worlds is, like its predecessor, similar to Marble Madness. Controlling GERALD, you must move through the isometrically viewed landscape (largely flick-screen on the ST). There are two skill levels; the harder one features more of the precarious ledges and falls of Spindizzy. Each one takes you to a different matrix of levels, which can be played in different orders and each consist of 10 screens, with a bonus level at the end.[CR]You have limited energy, which can be recharged by collecting crystals. Fuel is limited, and is reduced by contact with hazards - generating a replacement GERALD takes time. There are many gates which are opened by running into spaces of the same colour. There are also aliens to avoid, and most movement is along thin slippery ledges with heavily inertia-based controls.</plot>

				<title_clean>Star Fox</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Star Fox (known in Europe as Starwing) is a 3D sci-fi shooter developed by Nintendo EAD (with assistance from Argonaut) and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on March 23, 1993.Set in the Lylat System, a star system inhabited by anthropomorphic animals, players control the Arwing (a prototype fighter spacecraft) of Fox McCloud (the leader of the elite Star Fox team) as he and his three squadmates (Falco Lombardi, Peppy Hare, and Slippy Toad) journey throughout Lylat (in one of three main paths) from their home base in Corneria to counter-attack the invading forces of Andross.Similar to other scrolling shooters at the time, the player does not have the ability to freely navigate the playing field; the controlled Arwing moves in a fixed linear path. Despite this, players can move the Arwing around their plane of movement (dodging enemies and obstacles while aiming at enemies in front of them) and perform special abilities to evade enemy fire (including boosting, braking, and barrel rolls). While most of the game is in the third-person perspective, the game can switch to first-person at certain levels.It is the first game to use Argonaut's Super FX co-processor chip, giving the game the ability to render advanced 3D polygons in real-time. Nintendo EAD would later use this chip, as well as Star Fox's graphical style, for Stunt Race FX.The game nearly received a sequel for the SNES with an improved version of the Super FX chip. Dubbed Star Fox 2, this sequel would have introduced a non-linear campaign with real-time strategy elements (where players have to traverse the Lylat System to liberate planets and prevent the conquest of Corneria), full ship control (instead of on-rails movement), and new playable characters (with new playable ship types). This version was nearly complete before being cancelled (due to the release of the Nintendo 64), although the alpha version was leaked onto the internet. Despite the cancellation, the original game would still spawn a series of shooters, starting with Star Fox 64 for the Nintendo 64 (which includes the "full ship control" mechanic from Star Fox 2).A special promotional version of the game, known as both Star Fox: Super Weekend and Star Fox: Official Competition in United States and Star Wing: Official Competition in Europe, was distributed to gaming shops in those regions in 1993. Thousands of copies of the game were made and most were later sold through the Nintendo Power magazine. In this version, players have four minutes to rack up as much points as possible on three new levels (two of which are modified from the main game) with infinite lives.A simpler remake of Star Fox (including the simple polygonal art style) was built for WarioWare: Smooth Moves as a minigame (known as "microgames"). Players pilot the Arwing with the Wii Remote's motion control through a short level before fighting a boss (a giant R.O.B. with a giant NES Zapper).[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story represented in the actual game is minimal, and as many older games is told exclusively in the manual. This is the story culled from material documenting this game exclusively, i.e. the expansion of character and plot in sequels or other media is purposely not taken into consideration.Dr. Andross, the main antagonist of the gameThe &#8220;Lylatian Conflict&#8221;, named after the Lylat System in which it takes place, originated from a declaration of war on Corneria by Emperor Andross. Andross was a brilliant scientist who worked in one of the most advanced laboratories on the planet Corneria, the fourth planet in the Lylat System. A child prodigy, his genius overshadowed other children, but as he grew older and began experimenting with Hyper-Space Energy, his ambitions blinded him.He conducted dangerous experiments in the heart of the planet&#8217;s civilian center, endangering the inhabitants. Not heeding the governments warnings, he was ultimately banned and fled to the beautiful &#8220;evergreen&#8221; planet Venom at the other side of the galaxy. The people on Corneria forgot all about &#8220;Dr. Andross&#8221;, until a small reconnaissance team witnessed unusual occurrences on Venom. Strange flying objects were observed to be maneuvering in great numbers in Venom&#8217;s airspace.It turns out Andross had overpowered and enslaved the technologically underdeveloped population of Venom and recruited them into his army, installing a military base on the once beautiful planet, which is now polluted and miserable. Although in service of Andross, the Venom people hope the Cornerian forces will overthrow Emperor Andross and free the Lylat System.As commander of the Cornerian defense, General Pepper requested the help of the Star Fox team, and Fox McCloud answered the call. Together with his teammates Slippy Toad, Peppy Hare, and Falco Lombardi he formed the Star Fox team, a band of adventurers highly skilled in all military engagement. They would be piloting the new &#8220; Arwing&#8221; craft, powered by a Hyper-Space Engine developed from Andross&#8217;s very own experiments.Before the title screen, the game shows the flight of the aforementioned reconnaissance team from Venom back to Corneria, and the beginning of the invasion that followed.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arwing, the ship that the team uses throughout the gameThe course the Star Fox team will take to Venom is chosen by the player. Three routes are available, representing easy (middle route), normal (top route) and hard (bottom route) difficulty settings. Different locations are traversed in each, although all obviously begin on Corneria and end on Venom, these planets pose unique challenges appropriate to the difficulty setting as well. A monologue from General Pepper precedes each mission, providing brief information on the new location.The Star Fox team are shot from the hangar and so the journey begins through 6-7 levels (counting two levels on Venom). The player controls the Arwing of Fox McCloud, which can be moved anywhere within the screen, but is not allowed to stray much outside the play area&#8217;s edges, giving the effect of flying through an invisible corridor. Although this may sound limiting, once accepted it is not experienced as restricting and never obstructs the gameplay.A variety of weapons and upgrades are available in the game, such as blaster upgrades, health rings, extra lives, and nova bombs. A more in-depth look at all the weapons and power-ups is below.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]BlasterThe main weapon of the Arwing, it never runs out of ammunition nor overheats. Pressing and holding the Y button fires three shots, but it doesn&#8217;t auto-repeat, so the button must be mashed for continuous fire.Twin BlasterAn upgrade to the standard blaster, twin blasters are obtained when the appropriate icon is picked up. As the name says, it is similar to the single blaster except that it fires from each wing and shoots two blasts side by side. Because it is fired from the wings, when the wings are damaged the upgrade is lost and reverts to the single blaster.Twin Blaster Type-BWhen upgraded a second time, plasma cannons become available that do a lot more damage than the normal blasters. It is also fired from the wing so subject to wing damage.Nova BombA mildly powerful bomb that is most for useful taking out many enemies at once. Pressing A once fires it, pressing it again detonates it. The blast radius grows slowly, so good timing is required to use it most effectively. The Arwing starts out with three of them, and more can be collected by picking up the icon. The bomb loadout does not reset between missions, only after the Arwing has been destroyed.[CR]Other Items[CR]Energy RingA ring of yellow triangles that refills a small amount of the ship&#8217;s energy bar.Midway RingA ring of grey triangles that refills a large part of the ship&#8217;s energy bar and provides a checkpoint from which to restart when crashed.ShieldsPick up the shield icon to become invulnerable for a view hits. The energy meter turns to the shield meter and the Arwing becomes a wireframe model while shields are active.Wing GyroscopeThis item appears instead of the blaster icon when one or both wings are damaged. It will repair the wings, but won't give twin blasters.Extra LifeThere are rings of three blue-white-red diamonds, which when all three diamonds are hit, produce an extra life in the middle[CR]Maneuvers[CR]BankPress R to bank to the right and L to bank to the left. Used throughout the game to get through narrow spaces.Barrel RollDouble-tap R or L to make the Arwing do a clockwise or counter-clockwise barrel roll respectively. Reflects enemy fire and deflects missiles.Brake and BoostPress X to boost and B to brake, necessary to get past all kinds of timed obstacles. Not as useful in combat.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Polygon View Mode[CR]At the continue screen after you lose your last ship, you can play with the polygons on the screen. Here are the controls. [CR]Controller 1: [CR]Left and Right-Rotate object horizontally [CR]Up and Down-Rotate object vertically [CR]L button-Zoom in [CR]R button-Zoom out [CR]X button-Stop rotation [CR]A button-Hold it down while rotating to ''draw'' with the object. Release the button to clear the screen. [CR]Controller 2: [CR]Up,Down,Left,Right,SELECT,START,Y, or B-Changes to a different object[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Black Hole[CR]To enter the black hole, a secret area on the map with no apparent way in, you must enter Level 1-2 (Asteroid Belt) and keep going until you find a spinning asteroid bar. Hit the center of the asteroid bar just before you hit it. Do it with the next 2.  If you hit all 3 bars right before you hit them (fly through where the breakable asteroid was....) A Laughing asteroid will appear. Shoot it repeatedly to open the gateway to the Black Hole.  [CR]There are three level warps in the Black Hole. Fly through and look around this Lost ship graveyard....[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Black Hole[CR]Choose level three, then go to the asteroid belt and keep shooting the second big asteroid until it is destroyed. A bird-like object will fly out. Do not shoot it. Ram into it to travel ''out of this dimension''. Shoot the paper-like objects. The boss does not have a life meter, just icons (until they display three 7s) Shoot ''THE END'' letters until they are in the right position. The letters will be orange when they are correct.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Title Screen Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Crossroads of Time is a secretly great game. It's an action platformer from a time when most games were platformers.  You take command of various characters from the TV show who must battle it out with Cardassians, Borg, and other recognizable faces from the Star Trek universe.  Shuttle Craft Level [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay is simple and mostly consists of platforming and some simple combat. To spice things up there are also boss battles spread throughout the game, as well as an interesting section in which you take control of a shuttle and must navigate through the wormhole and even an asteroid field to catch up to a fugitive. A few other challenges are added and a memorable  a level where you take control of the shapeshifting Odo in a stealth mission aboard a Cardassian ship. The point of the game is achieved, it feels like an episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Crossroads of Time serves as an excellent example of what a good game was at the time as well as how to do a Tv or Film tie in correctly.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Star Trek - The Next Generation - Future's Past</title_clean>
				<plot>Future's Past is an adventure game in which the player is investigating the relationship between the Romulans, an alien race called the Chodak, and a temporal device. The game plays as an episode of the series does, in that the player communicates with members of the crew and interacts with them in a variety of ways. In game areas include the main bridge, transporter room, conference room, alien ships, and planet surfaces.[CR]The main bridge offers a large amount of interactivity. Here the player can interact with each crew member, interviewing them to gain knowledge for the mission and to solicit opinions on how to proceed. The bridge has a variety of terminals, including the Conn, communications, engineering, the main computer, and access to the transporter room and conference room. The engineering terminal gives the player control over ship repair duties, in a similar style to the PC game Star Trek: The Next Generation - A Final Unity. The main computer offers a material to research for missions, and general information about the Star Trek universe. The Conn is the ship's navigational control and is where the player plots course and speed to various game destinations. In the conference room the player is briefed with the crew regarding how to proceed at various points throughout the story.[CR]When the player goes to the transporter room, planning to beam to a destination, he can choose his crew to bring along. Each crew member has stats that decide how effective he will be at certain tasks, such as tactical, technical, strength and health. Choosing a selection of characters that target the mission goals can make the gameplay much easier. At the destination, the player has individual access to each character and their inventory. The phaser, tricorder, and various specialized devices (such as medical equipment) are used in the game to interact with the environment.[CR]In-game events are played out through conversations on the main bridge viewscreen, in-person on away missions, and via short in-game animated cinematics. The game's intro mimics the intro of television series.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]:[CR]The game has three different settings.[CR]Bridge- Various interface stations allow the player to navigate, start away missions, and access the password system which can be used to play saved games at different points of the game.[CR]Combat- Should an enemy attack the Enterprise D, the red alert klaxons go off and the visual is transferred to a tatical grid that shows the Enterprise and the attacking ship. The player may fire phasers and photon torpedoes while maneuvering. Damage sustained during these battles can either be repaired at the Engineering console on the bridge, or at one of the three starbases in the sector. Damage inflicted can affect various systems, such as being unable to beam down to away missions, unable to access navigation, blurred and garbled communications, or ship destruction.[CR]Away Mission- The player controls four members of an away team. The player can control each one in turn by switching to the respective portrait. Certain characters have different abilities based on their service branch.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Level Select[CR]When the Star Trek Logo appears, press Y, Y, X, X, A, A, B, B.

				<title_clean>Steel Talons</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] The original Steel Talons two player arcade cabinet.[CR]Steel Talons is a helicopter combat arcade game released by Atari in 1991. It is a spiritual successor to Battlezone, another vector graphics based war game. The arcade cabinet is a side by side two player cabinet that allowed the player to sit inside while they play to recreate the experience of being inside an actual helicopter cockpit. The game features large open world levels in several different terrains, and the possibility of both co-operative and competitive play with the player on the other side of the cabinet.[CR]Steel Talons was ported to the Genesis and Super Nintendo, as well as Atari's home systems the Atari ST, Atari Lynx and Atari Falcon. Each system approached the game's 3D vector polygon graphics differently. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Steel Talons is a helicopter combat simulator where the player is placed into a stage and given an objective to complete. These objectives can be either combat related, such as clearing out all the enemies on the field, to trying to fly through a canyon without crashing into the walls. Almost all levels feature some enemies that the player has to fight, and as the game progresses and the difficulty ramps up, the number of enemies and their aggression ramps up considerably.[CR]The player can only take a certain amount of damage before their helicopter explodes, but this does not end the game then and there. Death only depletes the player's fuel supply, which serves as both the unofficial time meter and the player's lives. In earlier levels, the limited amount of enemies gave the player ample time to clear them out before the fuel gauge ran out, but in later levels the player has little room for error before they start running low. The fuel gauge serves as both a time limit for stages, and as a way to get more quarters out of the player, as each additional quarter refuels the helicopter in mid level. [CR]Earlier levels feature enemies that are scattered so the player only has to handle one at a time, and they also attack much less frequently and from closer distances. As the difficulty ramps up, enemies are grouped together and attack when they are farther away making them much more challenging to take out. If the player completes a level, their helicopter is repaired for the next. [CR]Co-operative play is available if both players start the game and selects the same level at the same time. Co-operative play makes the game significantly easier as players can either attack enemies together drawing fire and sharing the damage, or by heading out separately and clearing out the level in half of the time. A co-op game also helps out players by preventing any game overs as long as one player remains alive. While crashing in single-player forced the player to restart from scratch, as long as one person is left in the stage, the other can start over with a new helicopter and join in again. [CR]If two players start at the same time, they can also unlock and select a death-match stage in the game which is dedicated to one on one combat with the other player. Unlike the other stages, this level is much smaller and features a sort of urban environment with large towers for players to hide behind and try to catch their opponent off guard. While unique for the time, the combat is somewhat limited as the players only had two weapons at their disposal, and it often boiled down to who managed to sneak up on the other first. Given the slow moving nature of helicopters, if one player was behind the other, they can often get a missile lock or a good number of bullets into their opponent before they can run away or turn around to fire back. [CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]The arcade cabinet for Steel Talons featured somewhat realistic controls for the time. It has three major controls for the player to use all at the same time in order to fly and attack. The first was the joystick that stood front and center in front of the player. The joystick controls the tilt of the helicopter allowing it to move forwards and backwards and strafe from side to side. The joystick features two buttons, a trigger in the front and a thumb button off to the side. The trigger controls the 30mm canon machine guns which have unlimited ammo. There is no cross hair or targeting on the screen, so the computer aims at whatever target it assumes the player is pointing at. This occasionally leaves the player attacking a target they didn't want to whenever enemies become more clustered. The thumb button launches missiles of which the player has a finite supply per stage. Missiles lock on to targets automatically after they came into range for a short period of time and home in once fired. The missiles are very powerful and can usually destroy a target in one hit. [CR]Underneath the joystick is a set of foot pedals for the player to rest their feet on. These pedals control rotation of the helicopter allowing players to either maintain altitude and change their position, or the change the angle of their forward momentum. [CR]Underneath the seat to the left hand side is the collective. This handle controls the altitude of the helicopter at any given time, allowing the player to rise up beyond the reach of enemy fire, or to hide behind any low cover that is available. The collective has a bright yellow handle that was similar to a rubber bicycle handle. [CR]The seat itself is also an integral part of the full body experience. It came with a feature called the "Rump Thump" which shakes the seat whenever a player is being hit. This is more than a simple vibration as the Rump Thump feels and sounds violent, as if a hammer is being banged against it, which probably isn't far from the truth of how the device worked. Rump Thump was short lived however, appearing only in Steel Talons and Road Riot 4WD, but it was in many ways a precursor to more modern arcade setups that have similar, more elegant force feedback and speakers in the seats. [CR]Players have a heads up display on the screen at all times that gives them information about how much fuel they have left, enemies on the radar, their missile supply, and a small screen that either displays the area map or tells them what they were targeting at that moment. This is particularly useful because the limited vector graphics available at the time left a lot to be desired, and it would look as if the player was targeting grey squares on the ground. This helps create a better picture of what is going on, and also helps the player know if they were shooting at an enemy that can fight back, or simply a building next to it.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Passwords[CR]Just enter them at the password screen to reach the corresponding levels</plot>

				<plot>End 2 End is a football game with the main attraction of it being that it has the personal endorsement of former Green Bay Packer, Sterling Sharpe.  Game modes consist of Exhibition, Playoff and All-Star, however there is no Season mode.  The game features 30 different teams modeled after their NFL counterparts except that their nicknames and logos are absent from the game as well as their being no actual NFL players.</plot>

				<title_clean>Steven Seagal Is The Final Option</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]In September 1993, publisher TecMagik announced that Steven Seagal would star in his own beat 'em up Genesis and SNES game. It would not be based on one of his movies; instead, it was his celebrity itself. The idea did not culminate; the project, scheduled for release in 1994, delayed to 1995 and then cancelled.[CR]A downloadable beta of the game is available to play. None of the eighteen levels can be completed, although basic gameplay is intact.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Seagal combats a number of baddies, at least four of which are in beta, including scientists and mercenaries. There is substantial difference in their threat; scientists are easily overcome and mercenaries inflict one-hit kills. Seagal can execute punches, kicks, a throw maneuver, blocks, and jumps. He wields throwing knives and a gun which can be fired with the shoulder triggers. His ammunition of each is unlimited.[CR]There is some platforming throughout the game. Seagal, unfortunately, crouch-hops short distances, falling to his death often. The game is forgiving and allows the player to position Seagal, via cursor, to safety.[CR]It was intended that Seagal be able to complete levels by different tactics; game designer Steve Wik did reveal that stealth mechanics were in development. He cites two examples which would have served as an alternative or supplement to combat: using an object, such as a chair, to distract an enemy by kicking it across the floor (enabling a sneak attack or undetected progress), and sneaking through shadows.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Very little is known about the plot of the game. The general idea, however, is that Seagal infiltrates a company called Nanotech to avenge the death of his partner, Jack Fremen. This storyline is not fleshed in betas of the game; and this information is taken from the game's coding. Seagal seeks to destroy Nanotech's nuclear fusion facility which powers their network, and thus Nanotech itself.[CR]Development Issues[CR]An ad in EGM, from May 1994, blatantly lies about Seagal's involvement with the game.[CR]Development was overseen by at least two producers, the first of whom was a graduate of Harvard School of Business and a former bank manager. She had never played a video game; this naivety caused friction with the development team. She wanted the game to copy hot-seller Streets of Rage 2, which did not feature stealth. Her replacement fared no better insofar as credentials and, too, clashed with the team.[CR]SNES vs. Genesis Version:[CR]Two different production teams handled each version. One in Arizona (RSP), for the SNES, and the other, for the Genesis, in San Fransisco. The betas of this game are from the SNES version, and no material has ever been shown from the Genesis version other than a prototype. Steve Wik has called the prototype "bogus" for its unrealistic use of the Genesis's resources, e.g., rendering Seagal's character model against a blank screen. He has condemned the Genesis team, further, for playing politics against the SNES team and using their prototype to demonstrate that their team was better, perhaps in an effort to steal the project.[CR]Seagal's Involvement:[CR]Although the game features Seagal's name and likeness, he did not participate in development in any way. The motion-capture shoots were of martial arts practitioner Greg Goldsholl. Wik has contended that TecMagik was not willing to pay Seagal and opted, instead, for a stand-in. This only cost the publisher a few hundred dollars, according to Goldsholl himself.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level selection[CR]In the black screen before beggining a stage, press SELECT.

				<title_clean>Stone Protectors</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Stone Protectors is a 1994 tie-in licensed video game based on the toy and cartoon franchise of the same name. The Stone Protectors are musically-inclined warriors blessed by the gems of Mythrandir, which were sent to Earth to keep them out of the hands of Zok, the leader of the Saurians, who coveted their incredible power. Each warrior has their own color and area of expertise, as well as playing a specific instrument in their rock band The Rock Detectors. The series and toys were a short-lived attempt in the 90s to market the Troll dolls to a young male demographic, combining ninja weapons and rock n' roll with the Trolls' trademark hair and goofy expressions.[CR]The game was released exclusively for the Super Nintendo and Super Famicom. A Genesis version was developed but cancelled mid-production. A prototype of this Genesis version was eventually leaked to the internet. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game itself is a side-scrolling brawler. The player controls one of the five Stone Protectors (a second player, or a CPU-controlled ally, can also join in as a co-op partner) as they make their way through various stages taking down Zok's Saurian underlings. The player has three attacks: a punch, a kick and a weapon swing. The weapons are different for each character. Holding down one of the three attack buttons also performs a stronger special attack, though it needs a second to charge. The fourth face button allows the character to jump; the weapon swing and kick buttons also perform different attacks in mid-air.[CR]</plot>

The player selects various characters from the show and either plays through their stories in the single player or fights against another human player in versus mode.[CR]When the game was brought to the US a year later, Irem decided to graphically rehaul the characters, as Ranma 1/2 and anime in general had yet to enter the western mainstream. All the characters were reimagined as various sci-fi fighter game archetypes, with some undergoing more drastic changes than others. The character of Shampoo, for instance, was only given a slight hair color change and a mask and renamed Lita, while Principal Kuno instead became a skateboarding robot named Helmut.[CR]Conversely, the second game in the series, Ranma 1/2: Bakuretsu Rantou Hen, was left largely intact with its American incarnation Ranma 1/2: Hard Battle. The third (Ranma 1/2: Chougi Ranbu Hen) was never released overseas.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Though both rosters are completely different superficially, each character fights identically to their trans-Pacific counterpart.Ranma 1/2: Chounai Gekitou Hen (JP)Street Combat (US)Ranma Saotome (Male)Steven (Robot Suit)Ranma Saotome (Female)Steven (Without Robot Suit)Genma SaotomeTyroneRyoga HibikiCJShampooLitaKodachi KunoDozoTatewaki KunoGI JimPrincipal KunoHelmut[CR]Additionally, the characters of Happosai and Cologne appear during bonus rounds.

				<title_clean>Street Fighter Alpha 2</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Street Fighter Alpha 2 (known in some countries as Street Fighter Zero 2) is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Capcom for arcades (using the CPS-2 hardware) on March 6, 1996.The second installment of the spin-off Street Fighter Alpha series and the sequel to (and remake of) Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams, Street Fighter Alpha 2 features five new playable characters (Dhalsim and Zangief from Street Fighter II, Gen from Street Fighter, Rolento from Final Fight, and newcomer schoolgirl Sakura), new backgrounds for all returning characters, and updated gameplay mechanics (including the introduction of the "Custom Combo" system, which allows players to use their Super Meter to make lengthy timed chain combos).Sometime in August of 1996, Capcom released an update to the game (in Japan only), titled Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha, that includes hidden character variations of some characters (resembling their Super Street Fighter II Turbo appearances), an updated Custom Combo system (requiring a different combination and less super meter to perform), new moves for some characters, and hidden game modes (including Survival Mode). This version was further revised in the Street Fighter Collection compilation (for the Saturn on November 30, 1997 and PlayStation on December 16, 1997) as Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold (Street Fighter Zero 2' in Japan and Street Fighter Alpha 2' in Europe), adding Cammy (in her X-Men vs. Street Fighter appearance) as a hidden playable character.The original game was ported to the Saturn and PlayStation on September 30, 1996, featuring an arranged soundtrack and the game's hidden boss (Shin Akuma) as a hidden playable character. It was also ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on November 1996 (as one of the two games to use the S-DD1 microchip enhancement for sprite data, causing some loading times) and the PC on November 1998. The game was later re-released (alongside a revised Street Fighter Alpha 2 Gold) for the PlayStation 2 in the Street Fighter Alpha Anthology compilation on June 13, 2006. The PlayStation version was later digitally re-released for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable (both via PlayStation Network) on June 4, 2009, while the SNES version was digitally re-released for the Wii Virtual Console (on December 7, 2009) and Wii U Virtual Console (on May 22, 2014).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Street Fighter Alpha 2 retains most of the features in  Street Fighter Alpha: Warriors' Dreams like the three level super combo gauge, alpha counters and air-blocking. The main new feature in Street Fighter Alpha 2 is the custom combo system which replaces chain combos from the previous game. When the custom combo guage is at level 1 or above the player can activate a custom combo by by pressing two punch buttons following a kick. Custom combos grant the player a limited amount of time to chain almost any attacks together into a combo. The time limit is dependent on how much power was in the super meter when the combo was initiated. [CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The game's roster includes 18 playable fighters, five of which are new additions. Only one of these new additions (Sakura) is a brand new character. Three of the returning fighters were originally hidden in the original Street Fighter Alpha, no longer requiring a cheat code to use.In most versions of the game (the only exception being the original "Zero 2" Japanese version), fighters returning from the Street Fighter II series (except for Akuma) have hidden variations resembling their movesets from Super Street Fighter II Turbo. These versions of Dhalsim and Zangief were included in all versions starting with "Alpha 2", while these versions of Ryu, Ken, Chun-Li, Sagat, and M. Bison were only included in "Zero 2 Alpha" and "Alpha 2 Gold".

				<plot>The original Street Fighter II is a famous fighting game. Players select from one of eight characters: Ryu, Ken, Blanka, E. Honda, Zangief, Chun Li, Guile and Dhalsim to do battle with. They must then use their combat strengths to defeat the other seven fighters followed by four boss characters: M. Bison, Vega, Sagat and Balrog. Each character represents a certain country and has their own reasons for wanting to win against the others.[CR]Each character contains his own selection of basic fighting techniques based on three styles of punches and three styles of kicks. The effect of each of these changes depending on the characters orientation (ducking, airborne or standing still). Street Fighter 2 made famous the "button combination" style of gameplay used to unleash powerful moves specific to each character. These include the ability to project fireballs, channel electricity or capture the opponent in a tight suplex.[CR]Street Fighter 2 is one of the most cloned fighting games and its effects on gameplay and fighting games specifically can not be understated. Street Fighter 2 is responsible for making popular several different elements.</plot>

				<title_clean>Street Racer</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Street Racer is a cart-racing game, developed by Vivid Image and published by Ubisoft and inspired heavily by Super Mario Kart, and the first of its genre to allow 8 players to race simultaneously on split-screen. The game performed very poorly commercially on all systems, particularly selling badly on the PlayStation compared to other racing games released in the same year, and the decision was made to give the game a price drop almost immediately upon release due to poor initial sales figures. The game is now classed as very rare to find.[CR]The game features 9 characters and 8 tracks, and several different game modes. The 'Championship' mode is essentially a set of races with increasing difficulty. Once a player completes the 'Championship' mode on Bronze difficulty, they can play through again on Silver, then Gold, and ultimately Platinum.The game also allows for players to cherry pick their own tracks and settings to create a Custom Championship. Head-to-head racing with a CPU driver is also an option, along with practice races.[CR]The most unique aspect of Street Racer however is its Rumble mode, in which the 8 drivers begin facing each other in a circular arena with a destructible outer barrier along the edge with the objective of the mode being to be the Last Man Standing in the ring. To win, one player has to eliminate all of their opponents using the in-built weapons/abilities on each car or by simply punching the other players out of the ring (an ability that was available to all drivers). These offensive aspects of the game are also included in the race mode: weapons were not in the form of pickups like in Super Mario Kart, but rather each car had its own specific recharging weapons/abilities to suit the driver. For example, Frank Instein's car had the ability to grow bat wings and fly. [CR]There are 9 featured characters in the game (one of which is unlockable): Helmut: An ace pilot from Germany.Hodja: A magician folklore hero from Turkey.Frank Instein: Based on the creature created by Dr. Frankenstein.Suzulu: A voodoo specialist from Africa.Biff: A bald american 'bully' type character from the USA.Surf Sister: An Australian teenager (and the only playable female character in the game).Sumo-san: A sumo wrestler from Japan.Raphael: A suave ladies man from Italy.Rabbit: The secret unlockable character who is essentially just a rabbit who is featured in the intro movie to the game and on the box art. He is unlocked by either completing the 'Championship' mode of the game on 'Platinum' difficulty or by simply entering a password into the cheats section of the game.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Strike Gunner S.T.G is a two player shoot 'em up that offers fifteen (ten in the Arcade version) different power-ups and hordes of enemies to fight through. In two-player modes it's possible to combine both players' ships to create a larger, more powerful craft. There are eight stages, each with their own boss. The ultimate goal is to save Earth from alien invaders by using their own technology against them.[CR]Strike Gunner S.T.G was originally released in the arcades by Tecmo. The original developers, Athena, would go on to publish the home version for the Super Famicom in their native Japan. This SNES version would also be published in the US by NTVIC and in Europe by Activision. The European version was renamed Super Strike Gunner, but is otherwise identical.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]The SNES version of the game was awarded the following scores from Electronic Gaming Monthly: 4,7,6,7. From the review, "... A solid shooter with nothing really new or exciting. Lots of enemies to blow away but let too many on the screen and the game slows down".[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Stunt Race FX</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Stunt Race FX is one of the few fully-3D FX powered Super Nintendo games. Similar to Star Fox, its use of the effect is rudimentary, and the polygons are limited to flat shading and few in number. Stunt Race FX manages to churn out slightly more detailed environments than Star Fox, and they compensate for the increased demands on the chip by lowering the framerate and shrinking the player's view. With the borders in effect and speed/time display outside, there is only about 60% of the screen devoted to actual gameplay.[CR]Controls are very similar to other racing games, with the shoulder buttons acting as sharper turns than pressing left or right on the directional pad. Other than gas and brake, all the cars are capable of boost and another button honks the horn. Honking the horn serves a greater purpose than just showing off, however, as it also launches the body of the vehicle in the air, allowing the player to drive over opponents.[CR]Cars can also sustain damage, which is repaired by touching red gems located at various points in each track.[CR]Race Types[CR]The bulk of Stunt Race FX is devoted to grand prix style race series, where the vehicles complete four races and the best overall time wins. After the second race the player is allowed a bonus round, where they drive the game's semi trailer in a fixed 3/4 view - each lap that they finish in that behemoth grants them an extra continue, which are welcome in the later races as it's easy to damage the car to the point of self-destruction or be flung off the track by accident. There are four circuits, with generic themes like aquatic (complete with a floating track and underwater tunnels), metro, forest, mountains, etc. Most of the tracks use height to great effect, presumably to emphasize the abilities of the FX chip over a Mode 7 based racing game with a completely flat track.Monster truck ignoring the flooded track[CR]Each track in grand prix is available for time trial races as well, and winning every grand prix race grants the use of the motorcycle, which has all of the strengths and none of the weaknesses of the other vehicles.[CR]The Stunt Race portion of the game's title manifests itself in a series of stunt-based races that have the player collecting stars while navigating over, under, and around various bizarre obstacles. Each of the four stunt tracks are divided up into sections that will only open after obtaining all of the stars. Some of them require very careful driving, as they're located at the apex of certain jumps or ramps set high up in each level. Due to its stability and ability to drive through water (and there is a lot in the stunt races), the monster truck is the best bet by far, even taking into account its slow speed.[CR]The final, fifth stunt track is unlocked by beating all the others. It pits the player against the other cars in a fixed isometric viewpoint much like an RC racer, and challenges the player to smash into each vehicle (blowing it to pieces) in the shortest amount of time.[CR]There is also a two player mode in Stunt Race FX, but it's limited compared to the single player - the already small view shrinks further, and the players are limited to four tracks that have much less detail.[CR]Vehicles[CR]Stunt Race FX features five vehicles, although one of them (the semi) barely counts as its slow, unwieldy, and can only be used during the grand prix bonus rounds. The other four are ranked in terms of speed here:Monster Truck - Huge tires, high durability, fast acceleration, slow speed. The monster truck can drive through water just as fast as regular pavement, although it never hits much of a top speed in either case. Good for beginners, it accelerates fast and can take a solid beating, but it's of little use other than the stunt races.Compact - Tiny tires, and a moderate rating everywhere else, this is sort of a lame duck in the roster of Stunt Race vehicles as it excels at absolutely nothing. It does hit a higher top speed than the monster truck, but its tiny tires guarantee it will grind almost to a halt while driving through water and it cannot match the top speed of the faster vehicles.Racer - Medium-size tires, low durability, slow acceleration, and frightening top speed. The racer is a decent vehicle for the grand prix courses, although it requires much more skill to use due to its high speed and propensity to explode at a moment's notice.Motorcycle - Huge tires, moderate durability, fast acceleration, high top speed. The motorcycle is unlocked through gameplay and it's easy to see why it's not available at the start. It takes some getting used to as it only has two tires and tends to turn differently than all the others, but it can take more of a beating than the racer, has better acceleration, and it's not subject to slowing down while driving through puddles of water.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Arwing in Night Owl[CR]In the Night Owl stage, there should be four small "StarFox" signs on the walls of the course, that fall if you crash into them. Ram all four signs, and an Arwing from Star Fox will fly in and drop a power-up.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Control the animation when the game is paused[CR]Pause the game and when the pause animation comes up, press R to make the animation run in slow motion.  Press Y to speed up the car in the animation, or press Select to make it run backwards.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Control the animation when the game is paused[CR] To play battle Trax alone, select Battle Trax made and cars for both players. After the green light, wait about two seconds before hitting the gas. Any vehicle not activated by a controller will be driven by the CPU.</plot>

				<title_clean>Sunset Riders</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sunset Riders is an action game from Konami that sets four bounty hunters across the Wild West to claim rewards on wanted outlaws. It began as an Arcade game in 1991, which allowed for up to four players simultaneously. It was later ported to the Sega Genesis in 1992, and the Super Nintendo in 1993.[CR]The Arcade version was intended to be part of the XBox 360's Game Room, but it never transpired. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Sunset Riders has four playable characters: Steve, Billy, Bob, and Cormano. Steve and Billy have revolvers while Bob has a rifle and Carmano uses a shotgun. The rifle and shotgun have a slow firing rate, but fire multiple bullets in a spread. The revolvers only shoot one bullet at a time, but the bullets fire at a faster rate.[CR]Players move on a 2D plane while being able to aim and shoot in eight directions. Some stages have two planes, an upper plane and a lower plane, that they are able to jump back and forth. Most stages pits the players going through a stage battling enemies and course obstacles until the reach the end of the level, where the stage boss awaits. Some bosses have henchmen assisting them, making the boss battle more difficult for the players to contend. Once the boss is defeated, the player is awarded the bounty on the targeted outlaw. If two players are present when the boss is defeated, the bounty is awarded to the player who hit the boss the most.Watch out for that log![CR]There are three stages out of the eight that differ from the other five where the players walk and battle their way to the end boss.[CR]Stages 2 &amp; 7: These two stages puts the bounty hunters riding on horses throughout the stage until they reach the boss at the end of the level. The players stay on one plane and navigate the level by battling enemies that ride horses along the bottom of the screen along with a wagon where an enemy tosses logs from the back of it to trip the hunters off of their horses.[CR]Stage 4: The fourth stage is fought inside a saloon where the bosses stand on balconies at both sides of the stage with a huge chandelier hanging in the middle of the stage.Power-Ups[CR]Sunset Riders features the following power-ups to assist the player in battling enemies in the Wild West.Rapid Fire: Increases the character's bullet firing rate.Dual Fire: Gives the character a second weapon. Revolvers (Steve/Billy): One revolver shoots forward, while the second revolver shoots upward.Rifle/Shotgun (Bob/Carmano): Dual fire expands the area of the character's bullet spread.1-Up: Gives the player an additional life. Players can also earn an additional life by reaching a particular monetary benchmark.[CR]The player can acquire the two power-ups (rapid fire, dual fire) by killing an enemy with the sack, entering doors at certain buildings, or at certain areas of a stage. If the player already has both power-ups, they will receive additional money instead.Bonus StageGet ready![CR]Sunset Riders features a bonus stage that is played after the completion of the second and fifth stages. The player can aim the crosshairs and in eight locations of the bonus stage (essentially in all sides of the screen). Enemies pop in and out of the eight locations. The player earns bonus money on the amount of enemies shot in the stage.[CR]Stage Bosses[CR]Stage 1: Simon GreedwellGreedwell: bury him with his money![CR]Simon battles the bounty hunters on a balcony protected by two barrels and henchmen that appear out of the two doors next to him.Stage 2: Hawkeye Hank Hatfield[CR]Hank battles the bounty hunters by jumping back and forth between crates across the train tracks with henchmen providing assistance.Stage 3: Dark Horse[CR]Dark Horse battles the hunters while riding on his armor plated horse. Henchmen provide assistance by shooting at the hunters popping out of the saloon's windows.Stage 4: The Smith Brothers[CR]The Smith Brothers battle the bounty hunters inside a saloon with one brother tossing lit lanterns while the other tosses bombs that explode upon impact on the ground.Stage 5: El Greco[CR]El Greco battles the bounty hunters with a shield and a long whip. He also jumps around a lot to particular spots of the train to leverage his strengths against the hunters.Stage 6: Chief Scalpem[CR]Chip Scalem battles the bounty hunters on an stage where he uses the three pillars on the stage's background to jump off and toss knives at them. If the hunters are near Chief Scalem on the stage, he will attack them with the knife.Stage 7: Paco Loco[CR]Paco Loco fights the bounty hunters on top of a fortified wall while henchmen attacks with guns and bombs popping out of a tree above htem.Stage 8: Sir Richard Rose[CR]Sir Richard Rose battles the bounty hunters in front of his mansion. Rose can defeat the bounty hunters by firing bullets from his gun as well as slide attack when he's on the ground level of the stage.[CR]Genesis Version[CR]The Sega Genesis version of the game is considerably different from the Arcade and SNES port. Only Billy and Cormano are available to play in this version with four stages that have two parts. The first half ends with the character(s) rescuing a tied up damsel in distress, while the second half ends on a boss battle.[CR]The four bosses in this version of Sunset Riders are Simon Greedwell, Paco Loco, Chief Scalpem, and Sir Richard Rose. Most of these bosses are similar to their Arcade and SNES counterparts, with the only difference being the Paco Loco fight, which takes place on a train.[CR]The Genesis's bonus stage also differs from the Arcade/SNES version. Within the four stages, players can shoot objects that may yield a sheriff's star for a limited time on screen. If the player collects this star they get to participate in a bonus stage for extra lives and money. The bonus stage pits the character riding on a horse chasing after weaving stage couch where someone in the back hurls prizes towards the screen. The player can collect more than one star per level, but the bonus stage can only be done once. If two players are playing, each player must get their own star or risk being left out of the bonus level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Advance directly to final level[CR]Enter the ''Options'' screen and use the d-pad to enter the code[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Advance directly to final level[CR]When 1PLAYER, 2PLAYERS, OPTION text is displayed on the title screen, press R, L, R, L, R, L, A, R, L, R, L, R, L, Y.  Now enter options.  You can now select up to 5 REST and 5 CONTINUE for any difficulty mode.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Advance directly to final level[CR]At the character select screen, press shoulder buttons L, L, L, L, L, R, R, R, R, R.  Now select a character.  The stage select and sound test will appear on the next screen.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Play on Very Hard Mode[CR]Most people probably aren't aware of this. However, if you beat the game on the Hard difficulty (either by yourself or with another player), the game will start you back at the first level. The amount of rests and continues you had when you beat Hard will be retained (and *not* reset/restored to the default), but any gun powerups you had will be taken away. The game is now noticeably a lot harder; bullets travel even faster, especially in boss fights. Bosses also have extra health. This mode is *not* selectable from the Options menu, so you have to beat the game on Hard every time to attempt it.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra Continues[CR]Start a one player game. When you run out of continues, before your last man dies, press START on controller 2 so you can play as Player 2 with a full set of continues![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra Continues[CR]Start a game with player one then get yourself killed. Continue on the game over screen with player two and select the same character as player one did. During gameplay press start on controller one and player one will join as the same character.  [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] How to make Richard Rose much easier[CR]This works best with the first player, since you start the battle on the left side of the screen, but the second player can do it too. When the fight starts, move your character just under the right side of the left balcony. You'll want to position him so that he's under the flower pot sitting on the balcony's ledge. From there, jump up, and if you did it right, you'll be on top of the ledge of the balcony (not the balcony itself). Crouch down and begin shooting the enemies that come to you from all sides except the top-right. This works best if you have both gun powerups. As Steve or Billy, you can simply hold Down and Y with both pistol upgrades and you'll never get hit. Do this until all of his guards are gone (except the one on the top-right). Now destroy the statue surrounding him and then the last guard.Normally, with the balcony destroyed, you'd have to handle Richard and his guards at the same time. This way, however, you can focus solely on him without worry. In addition, if you're using Steve or Billy and they have both upgrades, they can actually damage Richard while destroying the balcony, which means you'll basically finish the first part of the fight immediately after the statue is destroyed. This is especially useful for the harder difficulties.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Noah&#8217;s Ark 3D was created by Wisdom Tree and released in 1994. The Nazi enemies from the original game have been replaced with sheep, goats, camels, and other animals, and the guns were replaced with a few different types of slingshots. Players control Noah, who must feed all the rogue animals until they fall asleep by shooting grain and other foods at them with a slingshot. Super Noah&#8217;s Ark 3D was the only unlicensed Super Nintendo game ever released, and the cartridge was black and oddly shaped. In order to even play the game, players had to insert a licensed SNES game into the slot built into the top of the Noah&#8217;s Ark cartridge, to allow it to bypass a SRAM check that would determine if the cartridge was official, illegally exploiting the system and getting around Nintendo's built-in safeguards against unlicensed games.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Whilst in the ark, the animals have all become restless and have escaped their pens. Now it&#8217;s up to Noah to restore order and get the animals back in their places before the trip is over. The animals must not be killed, as they are the last animals on Earth, so Noah must slingshot food into their mouths, calming them and putting them to sleep. Subduing all the animals and returning them to their pens will thus bring the journey to an end.Steam version[CR]Piko Interactive acquired the license for Super Noah's Ark 3D and released a remastered version of the game for all three Steam compatible platforms on June 23, 2015.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Adventure Island</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Adventure Island is the first of two Adventure Island games for the SNES. It was first released in Japan by Hudson on January 11, 1992, then in America in April 1992, and finally in Europe on November 19, 1992.Plot[CR]The game opens with Master Higgins and his girlfriend Tina enjoying a romantic evening together in a treetop over Adventure Island. They are then confronted by the hooded sorcerer, Dark Cloak, when he flies in on a broomstick. Dark Cloak turns Tina into stone and kidnaps her, taking her to his castle on another part of the island. Master Higgins must then traverse five different sections of the island to rescue Tina from Dark Cloak.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game consists mainly of a side-scrolling action platformer gameplay, with some stages that are more vertically-oriented. Super Adventure Island features fewer weapons than some previous entries in the series. A stone axe and a boomerang are both available; both may be upgraded to fire up to three shots at a time, and a fourth upgrade gives those shots more power. The game also downgrades the available vehicles that may be used in platforming sections: while Adventure Island 3 on the NES had several different dinosaurs which could be ridden, Super Adventure Island offers and occasional skateboard that lets Master Higgins travel through levels at high speed. As usual, Master Higgins can be taken down in one hit from an enemy. He also has a stamina bar that decreases over time, which must be constantly replenished by grabbing fruit which is bountiful in each level.Stages[CR]The game is broken up into five main areas, each containing several sub-levels. The main areas mostly have two stylistic environments, and feature a boss at the end. The five areas are:A jungle and a volcanoA beach and inside a whale's bellyIn island treetops and a mine shaft (complete with mine cart ride)A desertA snow-capped mountain ice level, finishing with Dark Cloak's secret castle[CR]Many stages also contain secret bonus stages where Master Higgins enters a neon-lit nightscape filled with fruit and weapons.Mode 7 Graphics[CR]As a game released early in the life cycle of the SNES, Super Adventure Island makes copious use of that system's Mode 7 graphics capabilities. Each of the levels have parallax-scrolling backgrounds and some use of layered colors. Before the first stage begins, the game opens with a brief cinematic of a Master Higgins sprite being rotated and scaled to large size, to give the effect that he is falling from the sky. The game also had a multi-instrumental stereo soundtrack, which showcased the SNES's critically-acclaimed sound chip, made for the system by Sony.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Adventure Island II</title_clean>
				<plot>Master Higgins finally marries his lovely girlfriend Tina. But out of nowhere, a powerful tropical cyclone destroyed the idyllic mood of their honeymoon. And not only this: it separated the ardent lovers again. After the winds stopped blowing, Tina found herself somewhere on a tropical coast. As for Master Higgins, he went to the king of Waku-Waku and, along with his main quest to save his brand new wife, got an assignment to save also a princess, whom the king was about to marry. Is there a connection between those two events?..[CR]No, this is not a detective/mystery game, but platform arcade action. What distinguish the game clearly not only from ordinary platformers, but also from the first Super Adventure Island, are its light role-playing and puzzle-solving flavors. You don't have a time limit, but huge levels with many secret sub-levels to find, puzzles to solve, and treasure chests to unlock. You also can have equipment, such as swords, shields, etc. By defeating enemies, you gain health items, money, etc. Your HP is measured by hearts, and it can increase during the game if you find appropriate items. You also encounter random enemies while traveling on a world map.</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Alfred Chicken</title_clean>
				<plot>The player takes the role of a chicken named Alfred who must find his way through bizarre levels full of balloons, telephones, cheese and other strange elements. While he is on the ground, Alfred can walk, jump, and peck balloons and ground switches. While he is in the air he can dive bomb enemies or springs. Dive bombing enemies will destroy them. Dive bombing springs will bounce Alfred much higher so he can reach platforms well above his normal jumping ability. If he does not hit an enemy or a spring, Alfred will get stuck in the ground for a short time.[CR]To complete a level, Alfred must find and peck all the balloons. The last balloon will take him to a boss fight. If Alfred dies, he starts as an egg located at the last balloon pecked.[CR]Alfred can receive a few powerups during the game. For one power up, he must answer a telephone in secret areas to make a giant flower give him a pot of jam. The jam gives Alfred the ability to shoot a bomb (about the size of Alfred himself) which bounces around the screen collecting things and hurting enemies. Another power up is a worm that spins around Alfred destroying enemies that it touches. You must find a can of worms to get this power up.[CR]The music in Alfred Chicken is usually upbeat and silly. Mixed with the gameplay and characters, the overall feel of the game can be described as similar.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Scene Select[CR]In the title screen, press Select, then Start to bring up the configuration screen.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Baseball Simulator 1.000 is a baseball game released for the Super Nintendo in 1991. In addition to containing the typical options of season play and exhibition play, it also includes an edit-a-team mode and Ultra Leagues. In edit mode the player can name their team, choose the uniform colors, name every character, assign their stats, as well as choose from a wide variety of super powers each player may wield. In addition to the Ultra League, there are two leagues of standard baseball teams.[CR]Ultra Powers[CR]When using an Ultra League team (or if the player created their own), each player has access to an Ultra Power (or in the case of pitchers, between two and four Ultra Powers). Each power costs a certain number of Ultra Points to use, between 1 and 9, and provides an extra bit of oomph with which to wallop the opponents.

[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Force CPU Batters Ultra Ability[CR]This works if you are playing against a computer opponent and both teams have Ultra abilities (bottom row of teams).  When you are pitching (CPU is at bat), press X to toggle your Ultra powers, then B to quickly cancel them.  When you press A to throw a pitch, the batter will automatically enable their Ultra ability.  This works every time against the CPU, even when playing on Expert difficulty.</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Bases Loaded</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Bases Loaded in the first Super Nintendo entry in Jaleco's Bases Loaded series of baseball games, known in Japan as Super Professional Baseball. The game uses an unusual perspective for its batting/pitching, and employs far more realistic-looking athletes. This is counter to Namco's more famous Super Famista/Super Batter Up, which uses super-deformed characters. [CR]Super Bases Loaded was followed by the Japan-exclusive Super Professional Baseball II. The second Super Bases Loaded, Super Bases Loaded 2, is actually a localization of Jaleco's later game Super 3D Baseball.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Super Bases Loaded plays similarly to actual American baseball, and is housed under most of the same rule sets: one team hits while the other fields and pitches; four balls pitched outside the invisible hit-box constitutes a free base, while three suitable pitches results in a strike out. While many advanced rules are also in effect (such as bunt-strike outs) others - balks, infield "fly-outs," foul-pole home runs - are curiously absent. Additionally, players controlling the pitcher can deliberately pitch at players, resulting in neither the batter nor pitcher being penalized beyond an extra base. When players swing, however, their hit-boxes are eliminated, allowing pitchers to throw balls through the batter, and still receive a strike. There is a ten-run mercy rule limit in effect at all times, and a game can only last for up to 23 innings.Each pitcher and batter has a unique stance. [CR]Unlike previous entries that largely randomize hits, the game employs a variable physics engine that accounts for timing, bat, and pitch speed, as well as completion of swing, and registered statistics for both the batter and pitcher. Pitchers' speed and accuracy stagnate after every pitch, allowing pitch speeds to range from above 100 mph to below 60. Gravity involving the ball, however, is largely unrealistic, as balls can remain up in the air for periods lasting over 10 seconds. Bunts, especially, can be nearly impossible to execute without being caught. Likewise, lateral ball travel is also markedly sluggish.[CR]Baseball can only be played in Bases Loaded Stadium, under the same conditions. The stadium walls are riddled with fake advertisements parodying real-world counterparts. The audience will cheer after every play, with the same enthusiasm, for both teams.[CR]The game includes a robust single-player campaign, challenging players to play a "perfect season," or a season composed of eleven perfect games free of runs, hits, and errors.[CR]Roster[CR]Despite the North American release sporting Ryne Sandberg's endorsement, Super Bases Loaded contains a roster of twelve fictional teams, each with fictional players and statistics. Players can also choose to edit a team together (literally as "Team Edit"). Individual roster statistics can be adjusted to build near-perfect players.[CR]Technical[CR]Runs at 640 x 480 resolution; supports limited Mode-7 3DUp to two players; can play itself automatically be selecting "Watch" modeSoundtrack consists of ten themes, two of which alternate during playThe baseball that enters the screen in the intro can be controlled via controller slot 2There are no transitory animations for catching the ball, which makes it appear to strike the player's backIf a swing is executed after the ball enters the strike-zone, it will not register, and any ball will not be regarded as a strikeA knuckleball can be enabled by quickly cycling the D-Pad[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Control the Introduction[CR]When the ball appears on the screen (after the Jaleco screen), hold L and R and move the control pad in any direction to move the ball around as it comes toward you.</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Bases Loaded 2</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Bases Loaded 2 is the sixth game in Jaleco's Bases Loaded series of baseball sims, and the second for the Super Nintendo. Unlike Super Bases Loaded, which was based on the first Super Professional Baseball, this game is instead based on a separate Jaleco baseball game Super 3D Baseball - a baseball sim that experiments with a 3D viewpoint, made possible with the Super Nintendo's Mode 7 graphics and a special DSP chip included in the cart. Jaleco's Super Professional Baseball II, the sequel to the first Super Bases Loaded, did not receive a US counterpart.[CR]As with previous Bases Loaded games, the team names and logos are fictionalized but use actual American cities involved in MLB.

				<title_clean>Super Bases Loaded 3 - License to Steal</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Bases Loaded 3: License to Steal (JP: Super Moero!! Pro Yakyuu) is the third game in Jaleco's Bases Loaded series to be released on the Super Nintendo. It uses the MLBPA license and so all of the athletes are actual baseball players active in 1994. However, it doesn't have the MLB license required for team names, and so the teams are simply referred to by their home town/city/state. The game also uses three fictitious stadiums that player can select.[CR]As with previous Bases Loaded games, the pitching/batting is viewed from an uncommon isometric perspective rather than the "behind the batter" view that was standard at the time. Bases Loaded would see one more sequel before the franchise went defunct: Bases Loaded '96: Double Header for PlayStation and Saturn.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Battleship is an adaptation of the famous board game for Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo. The player can choose to play the original board game or play a more sophisticated variant that played more like a military strategy simulation game. In the classic mode, players take potshots at each other's grids in order to sink a quintet of hidden warships. The single-player "super" mode gives the player missions to achieve.[CR]The versions are functionally identical, though the Super Nintendo version has numerous graphical improvements due to having more development time and being on a more powerful system. The difficulty in the SNES version has been lowered, possibly due to feedback from the Genesis version.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In this sequel to Super Battletank, the player takes control of the feared M1A2 Battletank in 16 missions centered in the Middle East.  After they are attacked by an unknown group of enemies on both land and air, the player is tasked to root out these enemies and stop any further attacks on Coalition forces.[CR]Much like its predecessor, the gameplay is a first-person tank simulation, using radar to scout out enemy tanks and using the main turret gun to disable and kill any opposing tanks, jeeps, APCs and various other heavy weapons including SCUD missiles.  If the player encounters and air resistance, they can mount their Phalanx machine gun to cut down enemy choppers.[CR]Players also have smoke screens that can temporarily make them unseen to any enemy forces, plus they can call in supply drops to replenish their armor and ammo as well as air support that can level any opposing force in their wake.</plot>

				<plot>Super Black Bass is a bass fishing game where players can compete in four different lake tournaments. Player can fish in: Skywater Lake (Local Amateur), Clear Lake (Amateur), Murphy Lake (Pro) and Bluestone Lake (Super Bass), the goal of which is to catch a certain weight limit of bass before a certain time limit.[CR]There are two screens, the boating screen where players navigate a lake using the D-Pad to navigate, the "A" button for acceleration and the "B" button for reverse.  The "Y" button is used to enter the fishing screen.  There is also a fish finder on the lower part of the screen that helps the player in locating a good place to fish.[CR]When the player enters the "fishing screen", they can use the "L &amp; R" shoulder buttons to increase the distance meter, the "X" button brings up the lure selection screen, the "B" button can bring an overhead view of the location the player currently has the lure set for and the "Y" button brings the player back to the "boat mode".  To cast, the player presses the "A" button once to start the cast meter and a pressing it again when the meter is set at a certain limit to cast it.[CR]While fishing, the player will have an overhead top-down mode of the lake, using the "A" button to reel in their lure and using the D-Pad to manipulate movement of the lure.  Fish can be seen through the water, outlined in a light color while bigger fish are seen stationary and cast in a dark shadow.  Once the player hooks the fish, a meter will show up at the bottom, showing the tension of the line, when it hits to the far right of the meter, the line will snap.  The line can also be manually cut by pressing the "A+B" buttons together.[CR]There are eight different lures to choose from (Pencil Bait, Torpedo, Jitterbug, Frog, Crankbait, Spoon, Furry Sinker &amp; Plastic Worm) along with several different color variations to choose from and five fish to catch (Blue Gill, Rainbow Trout, Catfish, Northern Pike and the game's namesake, Bass).[CR]There are also attributes the player can have, Technique and Strength, that can be upgraded by catching more bass and  progress can be kept through a password feature.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Lake Codes[CR]Input this code at the Password screen:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Lake Codes[CR]Enter these at the password screen to start on the first day of that tournament</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Bomberman</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Bomberman was the first Bomberman game for the SNES. It was created by Hudson Soft in 1993 and has a single- and multi-player mode. The game, like previous titles, is viewed from top-down with the player moving around dropping bombs exploding soft blocks to collect power ups and to destroy the enemy (whether it is a player in multiplayer or monsters in single player mode).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Each area fills the screen and is enclosed, so the camera never has to move. The areas typically consist of permanent blocks and destructible blocks, in various colors and styles, with half a dozen standard enemies or a larger boss enemy. The player controls Bomberman, a small character in a white protective suit. He drops bombs at his feet, which pulse for a few seconds and then send flames vertically and horizontally a set number of squares/tiles. The flames destroy the destructible blocks and damage or kill enemies, but they also kill the Bomberman, making tactical placement of bombs very important, especially as bombs cannot be walked over once placed (unless the Bomb Walk power-up is picked up).Power-ups[CR]An important part of the game is making use of power-ups found after destroying walls or blocks in game. Most power-ups are lost on death in the single-player campaign. Examples are listed below.Extra bombs: Allows the player to have several bombs out at once (rather than waiting for each to explode). Allows for chain reactions.Extra range: Incrementally increases the distance the flames from where the bombs travel, potentially up to the whole width of the area.Maximum range: Gives the full flame range in one power-up.Super bombs: Allows the flame from bombs to pass through destructible blocks as it destroys them.Punch: Allows Bomberman to punch a placed bomb, sending it bouncing over walls into areas otherwise unreachable.Kick: Allows Bomberman to kick a placed bomb, sending it rolling in one direction until it hits a wall.Invincibility: Makes the player invulnerable. Allows a technique of continually dropping bombs into existing flame, creating a constant flame around the player as they walk.Remote bombs: Allows the player to place bombs and then press another button to detonate them, allowing for traps to be laid far easier.Rollerskates: Gives the player increased movement speed.Wall Walk: Allows Bomberman to freely walk over/through destructible blocks.Bomb Walk: Allows Bomberman to freely walk over/through bombs that have been placed - reduces chances of being trapped.Time increase: In Story Mode, increases the amount of time the players has to clear any given stage.Extra Life: In Story Mode, grants the player an additional life.[CR]There also exists in the game a 'skull' power-up, that has a negative effect when picked up. It essentially prevents the player from planting any bombs for a certain length of time. This is contagious - if the player's Bomberman is touched by an enemy Bomberman who has this effect, they will be affected too.[CR]Story Mode[CR]Stage 5 of Story Mode[CR]The campaign in Super Bomberman can be played by a single player as just White Bomberman, or co-operatively with 2P as Black Bomberman. Care should be taken as players bombs can kill each other.[CR]The story is set in Peace Town located in Diamond City which is Bomberman's hometown. Two villains, Carat Diamond and Dr. Mook, were holding a robot tournament to see which robots were the strongest. They then decided to kidnap Bomberman using a fake Bomberman to steal his technology with the aim of using this knowledge in a robot tournament. Black Bomberman knew what was happening and went on his own to head out and take out this fake robot. He fails and at the same time, his castle was taken from him. Black Bomberman warns White Bomberman of the threat, and together they try and defend Peace Town and defeat the evil robot Bombermen.[CR]There are 6 themed worlds consisting of 8 stages and a boss fight. The exit from one stage to the next can be found by destroying the destructible blocks. It can only be entered once all enemies have been defeated. Discovering the exit early on can prove a disadvantage, as hitting it with the flame from a bomb causes more enemies to emerge from it. The 5th stage takes the form of a gladiatorial battle with a series of robot Bombermen who each enter the arena in turn.[CR]Each stage features enemies with different abilities. Some examples of this are:Chameleons that change appearance to look exactly like White or Black Bombermen (potentially disastrous in co-op!)Enemies with springs for legs that can pass over walls.Enemies that disappear into tunnels and re-appear in other areas of the stage.Blue ball creatures that are attracted to and eat bombs placed near to them, preventing them from exploding.Tanks that shoot flames in random directions.Enemy bombs that float about and then explode exactly as the player's bombs - damaging each other and the environment.[CR]The Story Mode uses a password system rather than writing a saved game file.[CR]Multiplayer Versus Mode[CR]4 Player game with Punch, Kick and Rollerskate powerups visible.[CR]Super Bomberman was the first SNES game to feature 4 player simultaneous play. Since the SNES only featured 2 controller ports, a multitap add-on was needed that plugged into the Player 2 slot, allowing more controllers to be connected. Four players could compete in the Battle Mode, in which each player started in one of the map corners and had to use their bombs to kill each other. There are also environmental threats to consider such as springs that send the player high into the air (see image).[CR]Each game has a time limit of 2 minutes, and 1 hit kills each player. The last player standing wins a trophy, and the ultimate winner is decided by a series of games until 1 player wins a predefined number of trophies (1-5). Games are typically very hectic, but in the event of time running out the arena begins to shrink from the outside inward, crushing players who are caught under the falling blocks. If several players are still alive at the end, or if several die at the same time the game is considered a draw and no trophies are awarded.Stages[CR]Each of the stages (except for Normal Zone) has something unique:Normal ZoneWestern Zone - All players are in center box.Bomb Zone - Bombs are thrown into the stage.Jump Zone - There are springs on the stage so when a player jumps on one, they land in a random place in the stage.Belt Zone - A conveyor belt is placed in a box shape in the center.Tunnel Zone - Tunnels are placed which is perfect for hiding bombs to blast unsuspected players.Duel Zone - Only power-ups are surrounding the area and all players are trapped in soft blocks. They must to escape to claim all the power-ups.Flower Zone - All the flowers are soft blocks and once they are blown up, they are resurrected again.Light Zone - The stage is darkened but a light is shining and moves across the stage.Power Zone - All players have been powered up with no soft blocks in the stage.Warp Zone - 5 teleporters are placed on the stage and once the player lands on one, they rotate around the teleporters.Speed Zone - All players move really fast.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When reviewed by Electronic Gaming Monthly the game received scores of 9,9,9 and 9 in addition to being awarded the Platinum Editor's Choice and Game of the Month. They stated, "...one of the most addictive games since Tetris...One of the best party games around! .. offers all the fun of of the original Bomberman and really spices it up with loads of new power-ups and a huge variety of techniques. The one-player mode is kinda cool but it really shines when four people are competing".[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] World 1-2 Maximum lives[CR]On world 1 level 2 blowing up the gate to the next level will make an ice cream cone appear on screen. Getting this item will give you 9 lives if you have not died once yet.</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Bomberman 2</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Bomberman 2's single player mode focuses on alien invaders, named "The Dastardly Bombers", who kidnap Bomberman from Planet Bomber in their enormous spaceship. Bomberman must take down the five invaders and save Planet Bomber from destruction.[CR]Single Player[CR]With each section of the spaceship (of which there are five), Bomberman must progress through six normal levels by destroying every enemy, activating all the capsules (which alternate on and off when bomb blasts hit them) and finding the exit. Bomberman must then fight that area's Dastardly Bomber in a one-on-one battle in the seventh level and then in their boss machine - a large personalized mech suit - in the eighth. The single player involve taking out each one of the Dastardly Bombers by entering each of the worlds and taking out each area. Unlike in the previous Bomberman game, the area has changed from a closed square, to an open area with different map layouts.[CR]Castle Stage - Magnet Bomber[CR]Magnet Bomber is the first of the Dastardly Bombers Bomberman faces. He is able to magnetically attract and repel bombs, making it hard to line them up correctly while fighting him.[CR]Magnet Bomber's boss machine - Iron Gigue - is a giant robot that can only move laterally, sending out frequent punches. If it rolls over a bomb, the bomb will vanish, so the player will need to lead the slow-moving robot into blasts. Flame Stage - Golem Bomber[CR]Golem Bomber is a huge red leviathan that tends to use Bomberman's own bombs against him by throwing them around with the Power Glove power-up.[CR]Golem Bomber's boss machine - Breast Fire - is a multi-podded machine that moves in straight lines in random directions. It attacks by stopping, firing a quartet of fireballs that slowly fall to the arena and creates bomb blasts before moving again. Though dangerous, it's own fireballs will damage it, making it possible to defeat Breast Fire without the player ever having to lay a single bomb.Amusement Park Stage - Pretty Bomber[CR]A female bomberman (bomberwoman?), Pretty Bomber uses the "Heart Bombs", which move around on their own chaotically, to ensnare Bomberman.[CR]Pretty Bomber's boss machine - Mask Change - is a giant sun-shaped face that moves diagonally around the arena. It doesn't actively engage Bomberman unless he destroys one of its heart-shaped projectiles. Factory Stage - Brain Bomber[CR]Brain Bomber is, obviously, the brains behind the Dastardly Bombers' operation. He is particularly weak in a one-on-one fight, being able to only drop one bomb at a time with a minimal blast radius. He does, however, have the remote control bomb upgrade.[CR]Brain Bomber's boss machine - Robo Bomber - resembles a gigantic white Bomberman like the player. He moves slowly around the arena in a random path. His enormous bombs, when they explode, create unorthodox blast areas that can be hard to gauge. Dark Stage - Plasma Bomber[CR]The leader of the Dastardly Bombers, Plasma Bomber, fights with his own special looking bombs. He is able to throw bombs, but doesn't have any other specific advantages - he's just very fast and deadly.[CR]Plasma Bomber's boss machine - SkeleGuard - resembles a skeletal version of Iron Gigue and fights similarly, moving laterally across the top of the screen. It has more methods of attack, however.[CR]After defeating SkeleGuard, Plasma Bomber appears to surrender, but is shot down by an unseen assailant. The true final boss battle begins against General Ganzu, a floating eyeball enemy. Ganzu is impervious to explosions, so the only way to damage it is by throwing bombs at it with the Power Glove. Because it speeds up the more it is damaged, it becomes harder to accurately aim the thrown bombs (and avoid getting hit).[CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]The multiplayer "Battle Game" allows up to four players (with the Super Multitap peripheral) to compete in twelve different arenas, each with their own specific features and conditions.[CR]Super Bomberman 2 introduces the "Golden Bomberman" rule, in which the winning player of the previous tournament plays a roulette game to randomly select between six power-ups (including the Geta - or Clogs - a gag item that makes the player slower). In the new tournament, that player's bomberman turns golden-colored and begins every match with that power-up.Secret Codes[CR]Enter 5656 on the passwords section to enable Sudden Death in multiplayer[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 2 Extra Battle Mode Stages[CR]Connect the  Hudson Super Joycard controller, then turn on the Turbo feature. Now, when the title screen / mode select appears, hold X for six seconds or so. When performed correctly you will hear the pause jingle. Two new stages will be added in battle mode.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 2 Extra Battle Mode Stages[CR][I](Note: This requires a Multitap.)[/I] [CR]At the title screen, enter Battle Mode by [B]pressing A on a controller in socket #5[/B]. For the duration of your game, you can now jump by pressing Y in every zone except Zones 2 and 3.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Passwords[CR]Go to the password screen and enter these passwords:</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Bonk (JP: Chou-Genjin, EU/AU: Super BC Kid) is a platformer from RED Entertainment and Hudson Soft and part of their Bonk series of surreal prehistoric platformers featuring the eponymous caveman Bonk. The first three games were developed for the TurboGrafx-16/CD, but the series transferred to the Super Nintendo for the last two games as the TG16 was months away from being discontinued in Japan and the US. The game was followed by Chou-Genjin 2 in 1995, which did not receive a localization.[CR]Super Bonk puts Bonk on another adventure after he is being teleported through time and space by his nemesis King Drool. He ends up passing through modern Tokyo, a funfair, an enormous dinosaur's innards and the moon. The shrink/grow mechanics from Bonk 3 return, and Bonk now transforms into unusual creatures when in his "meat" mode: a powered-up form that occurs when Bonk eats meat, and a second form that is near-indestructible if Bonk eats another meat while powered up (or eats a large meat, which instantly takes him to the second form).[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Bowling is a bowling game for the Super Nintendo from KID Corp. that was released in the US and Japan. Up to four human players can compete in two distinct modes: Turkey Bowl and Golf. The game uses a system similar to those seen in golf sims in which the player has to stop a moving icon to accurately aim the ball and apply enough power behind the throw. The player can also change their position to compensate for their aim/power during this process.Turkey Bowling[CR]In Turkey Bowling, the players take it in turn to play three lanes of bowling. The highest score after every player has taken their turn wins the round. The name refers to the fact that the maximum possible score is three strikes, or a turkey.Golf[CR]In Golf, players take it in turn to play each "hole". A hole is a specific assortment of pins (such as a 7-10 split) and a specific number of throws with which to knock down all the pins. Using only the indicated number of throws is a "par", with other golfing scores (e.g. "birdie" for one throw fewer, "bogey" for one throw over) applying as appropriate. The winner is the person with the lowest overall score.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Buster Bros.</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Buster Bros., a port of the arcade game Super Pang, is an unconventional 2d shooter for SNES. The player walks across the bottom of the screen shooting a grappling-gun upwards at bubbles that bounce around the screen in various ways. The stages are set in various locations around the world, and a stage is cleared when all bubbles have been popped.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The goal of each stage is to pop all the bubbles within the time limit. Firing the gun causes a hook with a wire attached to fly upwards. Bubbles can be popped by hitting them with the hook, or if they bounce into the wire. When larger bubbles are hit, they split into two smaller bubbles. They continue to split until they reach their smallest size, at which point a shot will destroy them. The player can collect powerups, such as a faster gun or the ability to have two hooks on-screen, or pop bubbles with a clock icon to stop time for several seconds. There are two modes of play, but both share the same gameplay.[CR] Arcade Mode[CR]In Arcade mode, the player travels through pre-made stages set in locations across the world. Starting with a training level set in Japan, they continue on to locations such as Venice and the Caribbean. Each area has three stages, with some exceptions, and each stage is cleared when all the bubbles have been popped.[CR] Panic Mode[CR]In Panic mode, the player must stay alive as long as possible against an endless stream of bubbles. Destroying a bubble fills a meter on-screen, and the level ends when the meter is filled. A new level will reset all the bubbles, as well as increase the speed. Panic mode ends when the player reaches level 99 and clears all the bubbles for that stage.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Caesars Palace</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Caesar's Palace is a casino simulator game that was developed by Illusions Game Company and published by Virgin Games, Inc. The game is a sequel to Caesar's Palace on the NES, SNES, Genesis, and Gameboy. The game takes place in the Caesar's Palace casino in Las Vegas. The player controls a no-name, office looking guy as he tries to make all the money he can in nine casino games.[CR]GamePlay[CR]Office Looking Guy[CR]The game starts out at an ATM machine and the options are to either create a new account or load one already created with a password. If the player creates a new account, they receive $2000 in chips afterwards in $1, $5, $25, $100, and $500. Once done, the player enters in the Caesar&#8217;s Palace casino and can walk around playing any casino game, or go up and down the escalators. The casino games include slots, poker, roulette, red dog, blackjack, craps, keno, horse racing and lottery tickets scratchers. The player also has the choice to have conversations with other people around the casino, however, it&#8217;s mostly awkward small talk that leads into some tips on how to play certain games.[CR]To play the slots machine, start with entering one, two, or three chips into the machine and pull the arm down to see if three wining symbols line up. The slot machines use different chip values, which are display on the machine while the player is controlling the office working guy. There are seven different slot machines and the chip value can be $1, $5, $25, $100, or $500. There are also different styles of slot machines, including baseball and boxing.[CR]The poker in the game is called video poker and is played on a machine. The poker itself is the Five-card draw variant. To play video poker, the player can enter up to five coins in the machine and the game starts with dealing the player five cards. The player then can hold how many cards he wants. The player gets new cards replaced over the ones he did not hold. If the player hand is a winning hand then he will win the amount that is shown on the payoff numbers screen above the poker screen. There are four video poker machines in the casino, and they use $1, $5, $100, and $500 chip values.[CR]During roulette, a wheel with 36 black or red spaces numbered 1 to 36 and 2 green spaces named 0 and 00 will spin and a ball will land in one those spots. The player can place a bet on any one number, on black or red, on even or odd, the first 18 or last 18, one of three rows, and the first third, second third, or last third of numbers. Once the bets are placed, a video shows the ball going around and landing on a number. The minimum bet is $5 and the maximum is $500, $5000, or $10000.[CR]Red Dog is a simple game that starts with the player betting. Once the betting is done, the dealer deals two cards. If the number of the card the dealer deals next is in between the first two cards, then the player wins. For example if the dealer deals a 7 and a king and the last card he deals is a 10, then the player wins. The player also can bet again after the first two cards are shown. The winnings will be more if the first two card numbers are closer to each other. The minimum bet can be $5, $25, or $100 and the maximum is $500, $5,000, or $10,000, depending on the table the player goes to.[CR]Blackjack is a card game where the goal is to have cards that total 21 or higher then the dealer. The game starts with the player being dealt two cards and the dealer two cards, one face down. At this point, the player can keep receiving cards until they get to 21. If the player goes past 21, they "bust" and will lose. After the player wishes to stop, they will "stand" and the dealer will keep adding cards to their stack until they reach seventeen or higher. Once the dealer is done and if they have not bust, then the person with the most points total wins. If the player receives two of same card on the first deal, then the player has the choice to split. When a player splits, the bet is double and the player receives two more cards and has another chance to beat the dealer. After the first twos card the player can also bet up to twice their original amount again.  The minimum bet can be $1, $5, $25, $100, or $1,000 and the maximum is $100, $500, $5,000, $20,000, or $50,000, depending on the table the player goes to.[CR]In craps, the player tries to place chips on the table and some dice are thrown. The player may or may not win.[CR]Keno is a very simple game where the player selects the amount of money he wishes to bet and then mark ten of the eighty numbers listed on a card. Once done, the player is shown the results at a later date and if the player has won or not.[CR]Horse Racing is one of the games that can be played. Horse racing in the game is virtual horse racing and the machine&#8217;s name is Horse 2000. In horse racing, the player can place bets, view stats, or view races. When the player places a bet, the first decision is to make a single, a &#8220;quiniella&#8221;, or a trifecta bet, which means how many horse the player will bet on. Then the player picks what horse or horses he will pick and the bet amount, and if a single bet is chosen then the player also has to bet on if the horse will win, place, or show. When the player views the view stats screen, then the player can look up each horse and view the amount of races the horses ran in and how many times they won, place, or show in a race. In view race, the player can look at the results of the previous races.[CR]When the player goes to an ATM machine, the player has the choice to buy a scratcher for $100. There are three different scratchers, 60-Yard Fight, Match Two, and Triple Jacks. 60-Yard Fight is an American football theme scratcher with a 6x6 grid. The player has to start scratching a box on the bottom row and start going up each row scratching one box at a time. The boxes either have a number or a bomb. Each row has the same numbers and if a bomb is scratch, the game is over. The higher the row the player gets to, the more the winnings. Each row gets one more bomb where the top row has five out of six bombs in the boxes. In Match Two, there is a 5x5 grid with a blue background. The player has to keep scratching boxes until two of the same number shows up and the winnings will be that number. There are three bombs that will make the player win nothing if one of the bombs is uncovered. Triple Jacks has a casino theme and a 3x5 grid. The scratcher shows the dealer three cards and each box has a number and suit of a card. The player will need to keep scratching the boxes until the player beats the dealer&#8217;s hand. If one of two bombs are uncovered, the winnings is nothing.Also known as the "Game Over" sign[CR]If all the chips are lost or if the player leaves the casino, an option happens to either load with a password or leave. If the player leaves, a desert background that is moving with a &#8220;You Are Leaving Las Vegas&#8221; sign is shown and the credits appear.[CR]Trivial[CR]If the player does not make or load an account in the beginning, then the player won&#8217;t get any money; none of the casino games can be played because of this.[CR]The office looking guy is able to walk up and down the escalator in the wrong direction, but he will move at a slower pace.[CR]While playing a casino table game, if the player puts some chips on the table and leave then those chips will be gone. The player is not refunded back the chips even if the game is not played.Wannabe Cop[CR]The game has a couple areas in it where if the player tries to walk up to it, a conversion happens with a person that has a hat with a badge on it and he says the player has to be a &#8220;high roller&#8221; before the player can enter. If the player has a high amount of chip, then the player can enter and play either a game of blackjack or craps with a high minimum and maximum bet.[CR]The ending of the credits includes this quote by Authors " It seems that all the college kids have boring jobs sitting behind desks.."[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Start With  $1,000,000[CR]Start a new game and go to the Quickashier.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Simon Belmont, ready for his adventure![CR]Super Castlevania IV (known in Japan as Devil's Castle Dracula) is a 2D action horror platformer developed and published by Konami for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on December 1991.[CR]The first Castlevania game for the SNES, Super Castlevania IV is an enhanced recreation of the original Castlevania adventure, introducing many new gameplay elements (such as allowing Simon to whip in eight directions, allowing Simon to flail the whip around him, a grappling system, and a dedicated button for using sub-weapons) and content.[CR]The plot and premise for Super Castlevania IV remains the same as the original Castlevania and its other recreations: players control legendary vampire hunter Simon Belmont, wielder of the Vampire Killer whip, as he sets out through a dark, unholy castle in the year 1691 to destroy the evil Count Dracula.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Super Castlevania IV introduced many key features that have become absent in future Castlevania titles. Simon can now whip in eight directions, where he couldn't in the original games. Holding down the attack button, Simon can brandish the whip, making it so that the player can flail the whip, thus granting greater ability to block projectiles. Simon can now use his whip to grapple on to hooks, allowing him to swing over various obstacles. Simon can adjust the length of the whip while swinging using the D-pad. Returning to IV are the spike pits, moving platforms, and other obstacles.[CR]Simon begins the first level with a basic leather whip, but can gather up to two upgrades, each increasing length and damage (returning to the short leather whip, should Simon die). Upgrades can also be gathered for sub-weapons, up to level three, though these are much rarer than upgrades for the whip. The sub-weapon upgrades allow Simon to throw whichever sub-weapon he has equipped times the level. For example if the sub-weapon is level two, he can throw two boomerangs instead of one, level three he can throw three etc. Sub-weapon upgrades will reset upon death, and picking up a new sub-weapon.[CR]The sub-weapons Castlevania is known for make a return in Super Castlevania IV. In IV, sub-weapons are assigned to a button, wheras they were used by pressing up attack in previous games. This change is due to the eight attack directions. The only other game in the series to assign sub-weapons to their own button was Castlevania: Bloodlines, as it also featured multiple attack directions. Like previous games, Simon must collect hearts in order to use sub-weapons. The more powerful the weapon, the more hearts it consumes. Hearts can be collected from destructible environmental pieces. Hearts can be collected from destructible environmental pieces.[CR]The level design is more fit to the whip's new abilities in Super Castlevania IV. There are several things that must be hit by the whip, in addition to all-new grapple hooks. Simon can use the whip to grab onto the grappling hook, and then swing across the obstacle that is in his way.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]Note:  When you reach the screen that says ''Enter Your Name'' leave the space blank, do not enter a name or the password will not work. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Stage passwords[CR]Note: When you come to ''Enter your name'' Leave the space blank or these passwords won't work.       [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Full Arsenal[CR]In the last stage, before you climb the stairs to Dracula, jump down to the left.   You will land on an invisible platform.   Move all the way to the left of the screen and you will get full health, 99 hearts, a cross, a full upgraded whip, and a III stone.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Full Arsenal[CR] There are three hidden branches from the main path in this game.  [CR] The first one is in stage 3-1. There will be a point where you must descend a short vertical shaft. Halfway down here is a wall of pillars to the left. These can easily be demolished, where you will find a small side room containing hearts, cash bags, and some Roast.  [CR] The second secret, which is an actual hidden Block, is in stage 6-2. At the very beginning you'll need to pass a hallway with Axe Knights and falling chandeliers. The third archway has a chandelier but no guard. Hit the floor a couple of times and it'll crumble, revealing a stairwell into a secret area.  [CR] The last one is in Block 9-2. The third section has you jump across a bed of spikes at the beginning. After this you'll see several whirlwind tunnels and some coffins. The last upper platform on the right has a coffin and a tunnel. Let the tunnel suck you in and you'll find a hidden area full of bonuses.</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Chase H.Q.</title_clean>
				<plot>Super Chase H.Q. is an enhanced sequel to Chase H.Q. As usual, you must drive your way towards a criminal's vehicle, which is known to be involved in some crime, while avoiding passing cars to gain points. Your car also comes equipped with three turbos, which can be useful if you are way behind the vehicle.[CR]But this time, cars aren't just the only things that you have to worry about. You will also encounter bikes that shoot or throw firebombs at you, as well as cars that go the wrong way. (If you crash into one of these, you'll be sent flying through the air.) Not to mention other obstacles such as barricades.[CR]Furthermore, as well as the criminal's damage indicator, you also have your own. When you finally catch up with each criminal,  they are likely to shoot at you if you get too close to their vehicle, but you may encounter criminals who have different ways of attacking you. The fourth criminal, for example, launches a missile at you if you are further behind him. Once you are shot at and hit, your indicator decreases for every time you are hit, but this rule does not apply when you're hit by passing cars. When your indicator is empty or when you're out of time, the game ends.[CR]When you complete each round, a statistics screen will appear, and you are awarded points based on the time remaining, how much damage you've done, and the number of nitros that are used. One of the options allow you to display the game's speedometer in either MPH or Km/h. The game also has a storyline, which can be viewed in between rounds.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bonus Mission[CR]Finish the game without using a continue before Mission 5 and you'll play a bonus mission during the ending. However in the Japanese version, this bonus mission will appear only if you beat the game on Hard mode. That means you will have to beat the game twice.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bonus Mission[CR]Just beat the game and the hard mode will be available.</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Conflict</title_clean>
				<plot>Super Conflict is a strategy game that compares itself to a game of chess: there are two sides (Blue or Red) who must destroy the opposing force's Flag Unit. (In the fifth skill level, there is also a Flag Ship, and the game is lost if either one is destroyed.) Scenarios are laid on on a hexagonal grid, and each space has its own terrain type and can be occupied by one unit. You move your units around and attack enemy units in adjacent hexagons. There are also cities, airports, and shipyards, which you can occupy and use for your own purposes (ie. to repair a unit). Depending on the skill level or scenario you can also construct factories to produce additional units.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Unlimited Ammo for Heavy Weapons[CR]Switch your weapon after you've fired and you will hit with the weapon you switched to and not the one you fired.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Unlimited Ammo for Heavy Weapons[CR]When you are going to attack, fire your weaker weapon (which has unlimited ammo) and switch to your heavy weapon (which as limited ammo). NO ammo will be used by the heavy weapon: this glitch lets it have Unlimited ammo as long as you switch to it from the weaker weapon every time you attack.</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Double Dragon</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR] Super Double Dragon     The first console exclusive game in the franchise, Super Double Dragon is the fourth game to be released in the Double Dragon series. The game was released in October of 1992 in North America, on October 16, 1992 in Japan (as Return of Double Dragon), and on September 30, 1993 in Europe. The game was developed by Technos Japan Corporation and published by Tradewest for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Following a plot similar to the very first games, Super Double Dragon has left many fans unsure whether this was intended to be a "reimagining" of the first game, or a full blown sequel. The plot follows Billy Lee and Jimmy Lee as they rescue Marian from the evil Shadow Warriors gang. The leader of the gang, Duke, attempts to force the brothers to give him their martial arts dojo, setting the stage for Super Double Dragon.[CR]Development[CR] One of many unused sprites found programmed into the game's ROM     According to development notes by designer Muneki Ebinuma, Super Double Dragon was initially intended to be a much larger game than the end result. The game was to have a variety of features that either didn't make it in, or were only kept in the Japanese version. There were a variety of factors leading to the cut content, including Technos Japan Corporations's impending bankruptcy (which occurred in 1996). The need to speed up development coupled with poor marketing and low media coverage (the game was not even covered by Nintendo Power, and many other publications were preoccupied with the recently released Street Fighter II). In short, the game was overlooked. The game was intended to have a much longer story, more detailed sprites, altered stage design, different weapons, and cutscenes like those found in Double Dragon II: The Revenge. The story was meant to include Marian as a playable character, now working as a policewoman. Instead, she is only mentioned in the manual. The game's plot was to involve the investigation of the Shadow Warriors, headed by Marian. Along with introduction cutscenes for each stage, the final boss, Duke, was intended to be part of another team of "Double Dragons," and face off with Billy and Jimmy.Regional Differences   Return of Double Dragon: Sleeping Dragon Has Awoke     Beside the title changes (the game was called Return of Double Dragon in Japan), the Japanese version was different in many ways from the original version of the game. Considered to be a more complete version of the game, Return of Double Dragon included an option mode (featuring the option to change the difficulty and a sound test), altered weapon damage, slightly modified moves (such as the hurricane kick, which can be performed successively in Return of Double Dragon), the addition of two levels, and shifted background music. Other than these changes, Return of Double Dragon also included some of the cut content from Super Double Dragon's development cycle. The game included a more fleshed out story than Super Double Dragon, but was still slightly altered from what the original goal was. In Return of Double Dragon, Marian is a female police officer, but she is kidnapped rather than just investigating the Shadow Warriors (in the North American version, Marian is only mentioned in the manual). [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] Super Double Dragon focuses more on ground combat than its predecessors     Consisting of seven stages, Super Double Dragon is a traditional beat-em-up similar in style and gameplay mechanics to previous Double Dragon titles. Players can jump, kick, and punch, performing successive attacks to accumulate combos (a new feature in Super Double Dragon) Super Double Dragon adds one particular fighting mechanic to the game. The game now allows for blocking enemy attacks, as well as counterattacking (by blocking at the right moment, the player can grab and throw the enemy). Super Double Dragon also removes aerial attacks found in Double Dragon II and Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones, focusing now on more ground based attacks.  Another new addition to the series is a power gauge which allows the player to perform special attacks based on how much the power gauge is filled. The gauge allows players to execute special attacks, such as a hurricane kick, decimating enemies on the screen. After a special move is performed, the player has a short period where moves are slightly more powerful for a short time. Players can pick up and throw rocks     Weapons are an integral part of the Double Dragon franchise, and Super Double Dragon is no different. It features a variety of weapons, items, and power-ups found in its predecessors. Bombs (which can blow up all enemies in the vicinity), knives (which must be stolen from an enemy, but are very powerful), rocks (which can be kicked when on the ground), nunchucks (which are incredibly powerful and rare), and even the newly introduced boomerangs (which were criticized due to the fact that they can't be caught on the return flight) are all among the weapons found in the game.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Ghouls'n Ghosts</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts is the third entry in Capcom's long-running Ghosts 'N Goblins franchise. It is an action-platformer originally released in 1991 exclusively for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Like its predecessors, the game is famous for its high level of difficulty and features the heroic knight Sir Arthur on a brand-new quest to save his beloved Princess Guinevere from the clutches of the mighty demon-king Sardius (or Samael in the Japanese version).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arthur equipped with the Golden Armor in Stage 1[CR]The gameplay of Super Ghouls 'N Ghosts is similar to that of run-and-gun side-scrolling action titles such as Contra, albeit with a larger focus on platforming. Arthur begins wearing his standard Steel Armor, which shatters after a single hit, leaving Arthur only in his underwear; a second hit ends his current life. In contrast to the previous game, Ghouls 'N Ghosts, Arthur can no longer fire his equipped weapon vertically up or down.[CR]New to this entry in the Ghosts 'N Goblins series is the ability to double-jump. Although Arthur still jumps in a fixed arc, he can now execute a second jump that allows him to gain extra height or even change his trajectory in mid-air. This gameplay mechanic adds an extra level of challenge to basic platforming beyond that of the series' previous games.Weapons &amp; Magic[CR]Arthur begins the game with the straightforward Lance projectile weapon; several other weapons can be equipped throughout the game, each with their own unique properties. Acquiring the new Bronze Armor upgrade increases a weapon's damage, while the Golden Armor upgrade also allows Arthur to charge up for a magic attack that affects a larger area of the screen.Lance - Fires a single lance straight ahead. Upgrades to the Flaming Lance for additional damage. Thunder Magic fires a vertical magic bolt from the top of the screen towards Arthur's position, which then splits horizontally to the left and right for additional damage.Dagger - Fires a single dagger straight ahead. Weaker than the Lance, but can also be fired more quickly. Upgrades to the Magic Dagger that deals increased damage and leaves a damaging trail behind. Fire Dragon Magic creates a flaming dragon that sweeps around the screen in a counter-clockwise pattern.Axe - Fires a single Axe that slowly moves straight ahead in a looping pattern. Upgrades to the Hefty Axe which fires slightly upward before moving forward in a wave pattern for greater damage. Lightning Magic fires energy beams outward in eight directions.Crossbow - Fires twin bolts in an up-diagonal trajectory. Upgrades to the Magic Crossbow that fires three homing projectiles. Seek Magic reveals any chests hidden nearby.Torch - Lobs a single torch in a short forward arc; upon impact with the ground, a line of damaging flames extends across the surface. Upgrades to the Magic Torch that increases the residual flames' size and damage. Fireball Magic creates three magic spheres that orbit around Arthur, causing damage on contact.Scythe - Fires a scythe straight ahead which can optionally be fired down-diagonally. Upgrades to the Magic Scythe for increased damage. Tornado Magic creates twin tornadoes that swirl around to Arthur's right and left sides.Tri-Blade - Fires a blade that travels in an "L"-shaped pattern before returning to Arthur's position. Upgrades to the Shuriken for additional damage. Nuclear Magic creates an energy sphere that raises up from Arthur's position before splitting into two horizontal bolts travelling left and right.Goddess' Bracelet - Only available on the second playthrough, this weapon fires a large blast of energy straight ahead for a short distance. Cannot be upgraded or charged.[CR]Arthur's Golden Armor comes equipped with the Moon Shield, which can deflect a single enemy projectile before shattering. While he has the Moon Shield equipped, Arthur may also discover the upgraded Sun Shield capable of deflecting up to three projectiles. Additionally, these two shields decrease the time required to execute a special charge attack, with the Sun Shield providing the fastest charge.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]The game features seven full Stages, each of which is divided into two areas. Reaching a stage's second area will create a checkpoint, retaining Arthur's progress up through the halfway point of the Stage. The final Stage is much smaller and only exists as a single chamber to hold Sardius, the final boss.Stage 1: The Dead Place[CR]Arthur's adventure begins in The Haunted Graveyard, a zombie-infested cemetery prone to sudden earthquakes that cause the terrain to shift around unexpectedly; this Stage also pays heavy homage to the first level of the original Ghosts 'N Goblins and includes a new arrangement of its background music. Past the graveyard lies a coastal area where gigantic tidal waves carve away at what little land remains. Crossing the water leads to the overgrown Forest of Fear; exploding plant buds and rolling traps must be avoided here to reach the Cockatrice boss at the stage's end.Stage 2: The Rotting Sea[CR]Arthur heads out to sea and enters The Graveyard of Ships, a fleet of sunken sailing vessels patrolled by ghosts. Crossing the rapidly-deteriorating structures leads to The Sea of Despair, where turbulent waters, jagged coral and a host of aquatic demons threaten to sink Arthur and his tiny raft. At the end of the area, the Giant Barnacle must be defeated in a sea battle to reach the next stage.Stage 3: Vermilion Horror[CR]The heat turns up in the Crucible of Flame, a demonic refinery filled with lava and guarded by fearsome fire-breathing enemies. Descending through the slag pits and across a molten lake, Arthur reaches the Towers of Molten Steel, where Arthur's longtime nemesis Firebrand is encountered for the first time in the game. Past the dizzying towers, the Death Crawler boss waiting here spins and attacks with a hail of stones, but it is defeated relatively easily.Stage 4: The Ghoul's Stomach[CR]Somehow, Arthur ends up inside of an enormous living creature in this Stage. The first Stomach area makes use of the SNES' sprite rotation capabilities to rotate the entire screen several times, opening new paths as the level shifts. The second area inside the Intestine consists of a few moving platforms that sway side-to-side as they drift through intermittent plumes of toxic gas. The exit is guarded by a three-headed Hydra boss.Stage 5: The Deep Chill[CR]Fell winds howl through the Ice Forest, a gnarled mass of frozen vines patrolled by frost-breathing monsters. Scaling the icy growth, Arthur discovers a cave that leads through the gigantic Ice Wall surrounding Sardius' domain. Footing here is treacherous, with sudden avalanches and packs of ferocious wolves slowing progress to a crawl. After a long upward climb, Arthur battles a being of pure ice known as Freon before finally entering the castle.Stage 6: The Castle of the Emperor[CR]A trio of Firebrands greet Arthur just inside the Castle's entrance; players must defeat all three in rapid succession before reaching Astaroth, the final boss of the original Ghosts N' Goblins.Stage 7: Hallway of Ghouls[CR]The penultimate Stage features a harrowing gauntlet of Cockatrice heads, tiny imps and ghosts. Astaroth appears once again for a rematch at the end, but after his second defeat he transforms into the powered-up Nebiroth for one last showdown.[CR]In classic Ghosts 'n Goblins fashion, players that manage to complete the game's seventh stage are told by Guinevere that they cannot defeat the final boss without obtaining a new hidden weapon, the Goddess' Bracelet. The player is sent back to the first stage where they must complete the game a second time; players are also required to equip the Goddess' Bracelet before reaching Sardius, the game's final boss.Final Stage (E): The Throne Room[CR]The final battle against Sardius takes place in this large chamber. The demon king towers above Arthur like a colossus, forcing players to hitch a ride on a floating platform while dodging Sardius' lasers in order to strike at the weak point on his head.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Extra difficulty[CR]Beat the game on normal mode to unlock professional mode[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Additional bonus message clearing stage[CR]Hold up when picking up the key at the end of a level. A message saying "nice catch" will appear. It doesn't offer any additional points or bonuses but is fun either way.</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Godzilla</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Godzilla is an action game featuring Toho's famous irradiated lizard Godzilla. The player switches from controlling Godzilla as he rampages through a city to one-on-one fighter duels with various other Toho kaiju. The game is notable for introducing the unique kaiju Bagan to the Godzilla lore, as well as the concept of a powered-up "Super Godzilla".[CR]While the game was the first official Godzilla game for the Super Nintendo, Godzilla and a few Toho characters had already appeared previously in the crossover Super Famicom title Battle Soccer.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Players can control Godzilla through a transmitter on the Super X2 as he attempts to thwart the alien invaders that have come to destroy humanity in their UFOs. The aliens have also the ability to control some of Godzilla's greatest adversaries. During the game, Godzilla is revealed to have the power to transform into Super Godzilla after finding three capsules of Super S energy.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players guide Godzilla using the map[CR]Godzilla will begin at a certain location on battle zone that is displayed on the map view in the lower half of the player's screen. Each zone is split up in up to 8 map sections. Godzilla will automatically move in whichever direction he is facing and change zones until the player orders him to move in another direction. Godzilla's movement speed is affected by whatever terrain he happens to be traveling through, such as moving significantly slower if he is in deep water. As Godzilla moves through the level, he may tread across traps, smash buildings, or encounter enemies, all of which will lower his health. Each zone also contains a variety of power-ups and restoration stations for Godzilla to find. Godzilla can hold up to four colored orbs at a time to use in combat. The player must find and destroy the Mother UFOs and the enemy monsters in each level within a given time limit, or the game will end.[CR]Combat switches from the split-screen map perspective to one where the top plays like a fighting game while the bottom shows special abilities the player may be able to activate. Godzilla's special abilities include his powerful breath attacks, a tail whack, a body slam, a bite attack, and the ability to use items.[CR]Monsters[CR]King Ghidorah - The first level boss. King Ghidorah is causing havoc in Osaka, and destroys Osaka Castle.Godzilla body slams Ghidorah[CR]Mechagodzilla - After encountering the Mother UFO on Mt. Fuji, Godzilla finds another Godzilla in the second level. The fake Godzilla is quickly revealed to be Mechagodzilla, who has the ability to use a shield to reflect Godzilla's breath attacks. In the Japanese version of the game, there is no fake Godzilla and instead of fighting the original version of Mechagodzilla, players encounter the 1993 version.[CR]Biollante - Created from the cells of Godzilla, Biollante is a massive sea monster hiding out in Lake Ashino. She attacks with two massive tentacles, is immune to Godzilla's body slam, can hide underwater, and can perform devastating acid attacks.Bagan slashes at Godzilla[CR]Battra - Encountered in Yokohama, Battra is one of the easier enemies in the game. He has low defense, and can easily be dispatched with one of Godzilla's ultra breath attacks.[CR]Mecha King Ghidorah - Ghidorah has been brought back to life by the alien invaders, and they've given him a new fearsome mechanized head.[CR]Bagan - The only new monster to the Godzilla franchise in the game. Bagan was intended to fight Godzilla in a movie based off the game, but that never came to be. He has powers such as the ability to fire massive plasma beams from his mouth, and send a storm of diamonds at his opponent, and a final transformation.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Super Godzilla appears!The Japanese version of the game's design for Super Godzilla was later used as the direct influence for Space Godzilla. Space Godzilla features only minor cosmetic changes from the Super Godzilla design.Bagan is the most famous of the unused monsters of Toho. He only makes his debut on Super Godzilla on the SNES and no where else. It seems Bagan has a problem wherein everytime Toho studios starts to make a film about him, they always decide to scrap it at the last minute.Mothra was also planned to be a playable character in the game. She would have been unlocked after defeating Battra.[CR]</plot>

When the ball is snapped, run at the long snapper, then turbo at the kicker and jump. The glitch comes in the form is the long snapper never bothering to try blocking you, and you'll be able to block virtually any kick with ease.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easily block kicks[CR]When on defense, pick the Suicide defense and take control of either one of the two nose guards. Hold down the Turbo button and direction yourself at the quarterback before the ball is even snapped. On virtually every single play, you'll blast through the line and nail the quarterback before he can even move regardless of whether or not the play is a run or pass, simply because the offensive line never bothers to block you when this trick is performed.</plot>

				<title_clean>Super James Pond</title_clean>
				<plot>James Pond is primarily side-scrolling game starring the James Bond spoof hero, James Pond. James Pond is a walking fish with body armour, who is in a battle with his adversary Dr. Maybe. Dr. Maybe has captured lots of penguins as well as toys. Given the code name RoboCod (a pun on RoboCop), the remaining penguins send James on a mission to rescue the other penguins, retrieve the toys and defeat Dr. Maybe.[CR]James starts outside a giant castle that turns out to be Santa's toy factory. There are many doors there, two and two situated next to each other. Each door leads to a stage with many toy-theme levels, 50 in total. Hostile creatures lurk about in these levels, and they come in all thinkable forms. There are no weapons in the game, so James must jump upon them to defeat them. After completing two stages (doors), James goes on to another door where a boss is awaiting.[CR]James's body armour enables him to extend his body vertically to incredible lengths and grab hold of the ceiling. This allows him to travel along the ceiling and drop down on the top of an unsuspecting enemy. James can also pick up items that provide points. Power-ups include extra lives and wings that grant James the ability to fly. From time to time James may enter a vehicle, namely a car, plane or (flying) bath.[CR]Product Placement:[CR]In the original UK version of the game, the penguins featured as in-game product placement for the McVitie's biscuit company's Penguin Biscuits, making it one of the earliest games to use this form of advertising. According to a 1994 article in the UK edition of PC Gamer, Penguin outsold arch-rival KitKat for the first time in the product's history soon after the release of the game.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Invincibility[CR]At the start of the game, collect these 5 items in this order:[CR]Cake[CR]Hammer[CR]Earth[CR]Apple[CR]Tap[CR]Power Combo[CR]Collect the following items in order to refill your power batteries-Penguin, Oil Can, Wine Glass, Earth and Racket-spelling POWER.[CR]Unlimited Lives[CR]Go to the Sports level and play until you find a giant white ball on it's own.

				<title_clean>Super Mario All-Stars</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Mario All-Stars Title Screen.[CR]Super Mario All-Stars is a game developed by Nintendo and released on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993. The title was designed as a definitive collection of four previous Mario titles that had been released on the original NES. Thanks to the enhanced capabilities of the SNES over its predecessor, each of the Mario games appeared with graphical face lifts, adding more detailed graphics and animation, as well as remixed soundtracks. The game also includes a save system, allowing the player to save their progress before quitting.[CR]The titles included in Super Mario All Stars are:Super Mario Bros.Super Mario Bros. 2Super Mario Bros. 3Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels[CR]Additionally, Nintendo released an updated version of the game in North America in 1994 as an SNES pack-in game. This new version included the four previously listed games as well as the SNES launch title Super Mario World. This version is titled Super Mario All-Stars &amp; Super Mario World.[CR]The Lost Levels[CR]The Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 is included under the title "The Lost Levels."[CR]Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels is the original Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2. It wasn't released in North America until its inclusion in Super Mario All-Stars. The North American Super Mario Bros. 2, a heavily modified and redesigned version of the game Yume Kojo: Doki Doki Panic, had previously been released in Japan under the name Super Mario USA. As a proper sequel built from the foundation set by the original Super Mario Bros., The Lost Levels contains many of the same design aesthetics and gameplay aspects, but with a much greater degree of challenge. It also removed the option of a two-player game but allowed players to play as either Mario or Luigi, and gave the brothers different abilities. While Mario controls essentially the same as he did in the first game, Luigi is given a much higher jump at the cost of less traction on the ground.[CR]Nintendo Wii Release[CR]Box art for the Wii's Anniversary Edition.[CR]In 2010, Super Mario All-Stars was rereleased on the Wii to commemorate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the original Super Mario Bros. The game was notable as it was the only way to play the updated versions of the games on the Wii. (The virtual console version of the games are just ports of the NES version) In addition to the game, the package also included a thirty-two page booklet containing artwork and comments from Nintendo staff members and a CD containing tracks from games ranging from the original Super Mario Bros. to Super Mario Galaxy 2. The album also contains ten original sound effects and short music clips from the original game, including the coin-collection sound effect, the power up/power down sounds, and the Game Over theme. The pack was released in Japan on October 21, 2010, in Europe on December 3, 2010, and in the U.S. on December 12, 2010.[CR]The content of this edition of Super Mario All-Stars is identical to its original 1993 release. It can be played using either the Wii Remote by itself, a Classic Controller, or a GameCube controller, though all in-game controller graphics still reference the standard SNES controller.[CR]On February 15, 2011, after nearly two million copies sold worldwide, Nintendo announced it would do one final run of Super Mario All-Stars for the Wii. This last run shipped to retailers in North America on March 13, 2011.[CR]Super Mario History 1985-2010 Soundtrack CD[CR]Included in the Wii release of the title is a soundtrack CD. Notably, the box art makes note that "this Audio Compact Disc cannot be played on the Wii console".Super Mario Bros.

This glitch also only works on Super Mario Bros. 3 and only on the All-Stars releases of this game. By pressing both Left and Right, Mario (or Luigi) will move very, very quickly to the right - much faster than is normally possible, even when your P-Meter is maxed. This makes it much easier to get to the goal in a small amount of time (thus meaning more points) and also makes some gaps, previously uncrossable, now crossable.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] (SMB 3) Hidden White Mushroom Houses[CR]In certain levels, the screen moves forward and pushes you along.

Bowser will break the bricks, but he won't hurt you.

Make the tens digit in your score match the multiple of 11. Stop the timer at the end of the stage that you are playing in on an even number.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]One combination would be: 11 coins, 9,310 as your score, and the timer at 104.

Blast him with fireballs, but don't grab the axe just yet. Instead, wait the timer out, but make sure you're next to the axe when there's about 50 seconds left. Now get ready and time your jump on the axe so the Timer reads '000'. Once you reach Toad and the game adds the Timer to your score, you may notice that it changed from '000' to '999'. Thus the game thinks you finished with '1000' on the Timer and times that by 5.   Note: this does not work on the Original NES version of the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To get the N-Spade card game to appear on the World Map.

You should get a chest with a Warp Whistle.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To warp to Worlds 2, 3,or 4 during World 1-2, go to the end where the 2 platforms are rising, get on the first platform, and use it to jump onto the highest structure in the middle, then jump on the next rising platform, but this time, when it reaches the top, jump onto the TOP of the level. Walk foward and drop down the small jump, and you can now warp to Worlds 2, 3, or 4 by going down the desired tube, and pressing down.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To warp to World 6,7 or 8 during World 4-2, go to the place where three blocks are can be seen (where a pipe can also be seen). Jump below the third block where you can reveal a secret block but be careful on jumping below the 1st block because you can't break it thus going to the secret warp world unless you are a small Mario. Then step on to it and break the 2nd and the 3rd block. After you have done this, go down, then jump again below the second block now (it should have been broken now). The position of the two revealed blocks must be a stair from right to left. Anyway, step on to the 2nd block then braek the 1st block and there you can see the vine going up. Climb until you reach the day light again. Get some coins if you wish and you can now see three pipes like in the secret warp Worlds 2,3 and 4. Go down your desired pipe.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]At the very end place of world 4-2 (where you can see the pipe going to the flag) jump on the long pipe and break the brick above it and go through the end and you can see the pipe going to the World 5.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]In Super Mario Brothers: Lost Levels, if you complete the game without warping, (Going through worlds 1-8, AND world 9), then you will move on to 4 secret special worlds. Worlds A, B, C, and D.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To access this warp, you must be Super or Fiery Mario. Go to the pipe at the end of the level and jump on top of it. Jump up and break the block over top of the part of the pipe farthest left. Then, position Mario on the edge of the pipe, with one foot hanging off the edge. Duck, then jump backwards as far right as possible.  If done just right, Mario will slide through the pipe and the bricks. Walk over to the warp zone area and enter the middle pipe. This pipe will take you to world 5, level 1. The same area can be acessed from a pipe in the same place in 4-2. However, this is meant to be a warp zone to 5-1, whereas the 1-2 warp to 5-1 is a glitch. After completing the jump trick in level 1-2, you can also go down either of the other two pipes, both of which will take you to Minus World -1. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]This only works with mushrooms and fire flowers. Reveal a power up from under any block which contains one. Now jump onto the power up and release the A button. As Mario is transitioning to the next power up, hold down the A button, and Mario will jump in mid-air![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Go to either 1-4, 2-4,3-4, etc. and get to Bowser. Make sure you are Big Mario and try to jump over Bowser or run under him. Stand near the Axe and Bowser will start to walk towards you. As he gets near you, jump high, and touch Bowser and the Axe at the same time. If you do it correctly, you will hear the sound as if you were to shrink, but you will just flash and stay big.  Go to the next stage, and get a Mushroom. (Yes, there will be a Mushroom instead of a Fire Flower.) When you touch the Mushroom, you will shrink. Then get a Fire Flower, and you'll have Fire Power as small Mario. (Note: after you do the Bowser/Axe trick, enemies that touch you will be able to kill you when you are Big Mario. When they touch you while you are small Mario after getting the Mushroom or Fire Flower, you will turn back into Big Mario.) [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]This glitch only works in the castle levels where you fight Bowser at the end - for example, World 1-4, 2-4, 3-4, and so on. It is best to defeat Bowser with Fire Mario or Fire Luigi beforehand, as you must wait out most of the timer to execute this glitch. At the end of the castle levels, there is an axe which you must touch to end the level. If you time your jump correctly (a full jump as the timer goes from 002 to 001 often works) and land on the axe while the timer reads "000", you'll continue as normal to the usual sequence at the end of the castle. However, your timer bonus (50 points per second remaining) will be calculated as if you had 999 seconds, not zero, left on the clock. This allows for an easy 49,950 point boost! Note that this glitch, if executed on levels using a flagpole, will prevent you from earning the bonus in that level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Get to world 3-1, and become Super Mario. At the end of the level, by the staircase before the end flag, you will see two turtles coming down the stairs. Jumping over the first one and then jumping on the second one should cause it to hit the star and bounce back. From here, jump on it and keep yourself off the ground for unlimited 1-ups.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]After beating the game, if you do not turn off the console, you will return to the title screen. There, you can press the B Button to start as desired in World 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]If you just walk along the sea floor, Bloopers will never be able to kill you because they are forced back up just before they hit the floor(or you).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]If you run out of lives and want to continue then at the game over screen press and hold A then press start at 1 player (or 2 player) and you will start at the beginning of the world at which you died![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To warp to Worlds 2, 3,or 4 during World 1-2, go to the end where the 2 platforms are rising, get on the first platform, and use it to jump onto the highest structure in the middle, then jump on the next rising platform, but this time, when it reaches the top, jump onto the TOP of the level. Walk foward and drop down the small jump, and you can now warp to Worlds 2, 3, or 4 by going down the desired tube, and pressing down.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To warp to World 6,7 or 8 during World 4-2, go to the place where three blocks are can be seen (where a pipe can also be seen). Jump below the third block where you can reveal a secret block but be careful on jumping below the 1st block because you can't break it thus going to the secret warp world unless you are a small Mario. Then step on to it and break the 2nd and the 3rd block. After you have done this, go down, then jump again below the second block now (it should have been broken now). The position of the two revealed blocks must be a stair from right to left. Anyway, step on to the 2nd block then braek the 1st block and there you can see the vine going up. Climb until you reach the day light again. Get some coins if you wish and you can now see three pipes like in the secret warp Worlds 2,3 and 4. Go down your desired pipe. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]This is a pretty commonly known secret. If you touch the flagpole of any level with either 1, 3, or 6 seconds left on the ones place of the timer, you will get that amount of fireworks. For example, if you touch the flagpole with 126 seconds left on the time, you will get six fireworks! [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Well this secret is so easy. At the very end place of world 4-2 (where you can see the pipe going to the flag) jump on the long pipe and break the brick above it and go through the end and you can see the pipe going to the World 5.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]While playing, pause the game, hold Up, B &amp; A on controller 2 and unpause.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Method 1:[CR]Use any character and run right toward an enemy at full speed. Just a split second before you think you're about to get hit, jump! With good timing you'll be able to jump yet again in midair! [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Method 2:[CR]This is yet another way to jump in midair. Stand on the ground while you have 3 or 4 life units and let an enemy run right into you. You'll lose a life unit, but you'll be able to jump in mid-air.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]This is most easily performed in World 1-1. Grab a POW block, and carry it to the set of logs. Wait for a log to bog over the waterfall, then throw the POW block so that it hits solid ground. For some odd reason, this will cause the log to fly high into the air. Strange, eh?[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Go to world 1-3 and find a potion. Now find the vase next to the brick building all the way to the right side of the level. Drop the potion and go into Sub-Space and then warp into the vase (stand on top of it and press down) You will warp to World 4![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Go to world 3-1 and go through the door to the large waterfall with all the clouds. Now jump down and land on the platform in the center and enter. Take the potion and drop it near the vase. Enter Sub-space and warp through the vase (press down on the vase) You will warp to World 5![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Go to world 4-2 and get the potion. Now find the vase and put the sub-space door next to it (drop it from atop the vase) Now enter sub-space and warp. You now warped to World 6[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Go to world 5-3 and get the potion (make sure you can squat-jump to the vase, you need to get someone with a good jumping ability or use an enemy to give you a boost.) [CR]Put the sub space door near the vase and enter sub space and warp into the vase. You are now in world 7![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]When fighting Bowser in the final level of the game, his lower half will not do damage to you. That means you can avoid damage from his ground-pound attack by ducking if you have obtained a power-up at some point, or, if Small Mario, you can walk under him and through him without sustaining damage![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In the game, you need to wait until the N-Spade card game - which appears with every 80,000 points you earn - spawns and moves to the spot of a fortress on the overworld map. If you go there now and play it, the fortress will as if you had beaten it afterwards, being collapsed and unplayable. Note, however, that the bridges and locks affected by defeating the fortress normally will still not unlock or reappear, so only do this when these things are not required.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In World 3-4, about halfway through the level, you'll slide down a long hill to get on another long hill which has some Koopas on it. Take one of their shells further to the right. As the Lakitu appears above, return back to the left. There are two ? Blocks, with a pipe and some bricks between them and wood blocks on the ground. Let the Koopa shell begin bouncing between the wooden blocks and on-screen. The Lakitu's Spinies will almost always launch or crawl down to be killed by the shell; the shell will subsequently rack up more points and lives as time goes on and more Spinies are added.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]When you come across a Kuribo's Shoe, make sure that you have a Tanooki Suit equipped. Just before you jump into the Shoe, transform into a statue. Mario will turn gray and enemies will be unable to touch him.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In this game, when you normally jump on enemies in sequence without touching the ground, the points you earn will increase from 100, to 200, to 400, to 800, to 1,000, netting a 1-Up on the sixth sequential jump and all those after. However, if your fifth (the one after 800 points) jump lands on either a Lakitu or Boomerang Bro., you'll begin getting 1-Ups right then! This glitch was fixed in Super Mario All-Stars.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]At the start of World 7-1, there is a doorway you're meant to go through. Instead of doing that, run at it and jump at its top-right corner. If done with ample acceleration (and sometimes crouching just before jumping - that can help) you can glitch into the wall and skip the majority of the level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Whenever you find a white block (such as the one in 1-3 that leads to the Whistle), stand on it and hold Down until you go through it. Then enter a pipe. In most cases, once on the other side, you'll be unable to be hurt by enemies for the remainder of the level (although sometimes also invisible).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In World 3's first fortress (just after 3-3), there are several doors you're meant to go through in the level, guessing which is the correct one. If you enter a door and it's wrong, you can immediately press Up before falling to go back through the door. Further, doing this on the third and fourth doors will warp you, instead of to the gray pipe like the other doors, straight to the boss room.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Complete the game and watch the ending. Now start a new game. You got 28 P-Wings! [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Note, however, that this will not work on the Japanese versions of the game, where you simply stay at the ending screen until you turn off the console.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In Bowsers castle at the end of the game, it is possible to make it so he DOES NOT SPIT FIRE AT YOU.  This trick is easy and only requires getting to world 8 with a P-wing.  First off, use your P-wing on the map before entering the Final Castle.  YOU MUST GET TO BOWSER INTACT.  If you get to the Bowser fight room and the Bricks that he smashes through are not flush with the rest of the floor, then you are in the wrong room.  Now, when you reach Bowsers room, FLY straight up and to the left.  You will be able to walk on a wall above the screen.  Drop down on the other side. You will be in another room to Fight Bowser in.  When you drop, you will be on a door that opens to the princess.  Ignore this room and DO NOT GO TOO FAR TO THE LEFT.  If you do, you will have to fight Bowser and he will still have his Fire Balls. Fly back over the wall to the first room you were in and start the Bowser fight.  He will still throw his head back and make the sound of spitting fire, but nothing will come out.   ;)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Get to World 1-2 as Raccoon Mario, with the tail. Climb the hill at the beginning and jump over the horizontal pipe. Stand there for a bit and a whole bunch of Goombas will start walking out of the pipe. Wait for 2-3 of them to come out of the pipe, then jump ontop of one and HOLD A to fly high into the air. Now that you are in the air, use your tail to slowly glide down from the air. On you landing, be sure to land on a second Goomba. Repeat this process for as long as you can. Eventually, the points you get for hitting each Goomba will turn into extra lives. This can be done for as long as you desire to do so. [CR]This can also be done in 2-Fortress, and 7-5, but it is most notably done in 1-2. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To ''hide'' behind scenery, simply hold down for a couple seconds while standing on a white block. Then your player can ''hide'' behind scenery for about thirty seconds.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To turn a wandering hammer brother (the ones that walk about on the world map) into a white ship full of coins, collect a number of coins that is a multiple of 11.  Make the tens digit in your score match the multiple of 11.  Stop the timer at the end of the stage that you are playing in on an even number.  [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]One combination would be:  11 coins, 9,310 as your score, and the timer at 104.  This only works in worlds 1, 3, 5, and 6.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Get through an airship and defeat the boss as a frog, Hammer Mario, or Tannooki, and you'll receive a letter from the King that reads a little differently.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To get the N-Spade card game to appear on the World Map. You must do gain 80,000 points as one player, and successfully beat the stage that you broke the 80,000 points with. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]You could just use the warp whistle at level 7... [CR]If you want to go straight to level 8, you must use a Warp Whistle to proceed to the Warp Zone, then use another warp whistle IN THE WARP ZONE. You will be transported to the level 8 pipe at the bottom of the screen.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]These secret items will allow you to warp. Here are their locations. [CR][B]Level 1-3[/B] [CR]Find the white block near the end and crouch on to of it for 5 seconds. Then proceed to the goal, and go behind it. You will find a Mushroom house with a Whistle. [CR][B]Level 1 Fortress[/B] [CR]Fly over the top of the level when you find the first door with your raccoon powers, and find a hidden door at the far right on the ceiling. It leads to a warp whistle [CR][B]Level 2 Hammer Brother[/B] [CR]Get the Hammer from one of the Hammer Brothers here and use it to destroy the rock at the upper right corner of the Level 2 Map. Then engage the hammer brother on the other side. You should get a chest with a Warp Whistle.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]If you get enough coins in a certain course, you can get a White Mushroom House! [CR]A White Mushroom House in worlds 1,3,5,7 have P Wings [CR]A White Mushroom House in worlds 2,4,6 have Anchors [CR]Levels and required coins: [CR]1-4 (44 coins) [CR]2-2 (30 coins) [CR]3-8 (42? coins) [CR]4-2 (22 coins) [CR]5-5 (28 coins) [CR]6-7 (78 coins) [CR]7-2 (42? coins)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In 8-4, as you approach the end, you'll cross a pit of lava guarded by two Parakoopas before entering a pipe. This pipe leads to a flat area (except for a dip and a pipe). Past said dip and pipe, you'll find the first Bowser, a fake one that is nonetheless difficult to beat because you cannot instantly kill him with the axe like normal - you must either dodge him, or kill him with Fire Flower fireballs. If you cannot (or do not want to), approach the gap just after the pipe while dashing at full speed - do not jump over the gap. You will run into the wall by doing so. Hold Right on the D-Pad for a while until the first fake Bowser is on-screen (you do so because the camera will not scroll otherwise). When he is about one-third of the way across the screen, you can then just hold Down and you'll automatically scroll past him, still stuck in the wall, although the camera is not scrolling. Once past him, you are free to continue on - you are not required to defeat this Bowser.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In World 1-1, go right until you see a Red Koopa boxed in by some bricks. Hit the second brick on the bottom and obtain the Mushroom from it. Then break the third brick and either the leftmost or rightmost one, trapping the Red Koopa on a single brick. You can then stomp on it, and then on its shell like in the original Super Mario Bros.'s infinite-lives trick, infinitely bouncing it back on the wall before you can touch the ground.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]This glitch only works in the castle levels where you fight Bowser at the end - for example, World 1-4, 2-4, 3-4, and so on. It is best to defeat Bowser with Fire Mario or Fire Luigi beforehand, as you must wait out most of the timer to execute this glitch. At the end of the castle levels, there is an axe which you must touch to end the level. If you time your jump correctly (a full jump as the timer goes from 002 to 001 often works) and land on the axe while the timer reads "000", you'll continue as normal to the usual sequence at the end of the castle. However, your timer bonus (50 points per second remaining) will be calculated as if you had 999 seconds, not zero, left on the clock. This allows for an easy 49,950 point boost! Note that this glitch, if executed on levels using a flagpole, will prevent you from earning the bonus in that level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Before you touch the flag at the end of a level, make sure your coin total is a multiple of 11. (00,11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88 or 99). Touch the flag when the last digit of your remaining time is the same digit as your coin total and you'll receive a 1-Up.[CR](For example, 55 coins and 275 time left, or 11 coins and 081 time left) [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To warp back to World 1, you must be in World 3-1. Near the end of the stage, jump onto the spring and fly over the flagpole. When you land, run forwards, and you'll find the warp pipe that takes you back to World 1.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]When you're in World 1-2, jump onto the bricks at the top. Run forwards, and you'll go past the pipe to exit the stage. Keep running, and soon enough, you'll find the warp pipe that takes you to World 2.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To warp to world 3, you must be in World 1-2. When you reach an area where there is a pipe, a few bricks, and a Steel-Shelled Koopa, hit the first brick on the left. A beanstalk will pop out. Climb up the beanstalk, and at the top, run forwards until you reach the warp pipe that takes you to World 3.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To Warp to World 4 you must be in World 1-2.  When you get to the moving platforms jump onto the platform.  While on the platform get a running start then jump to the to the small brick ceiling then jump again to the next brick ceiling.  Keep going until you see 2 pipes.  Go down the pipe that's on the far left.  You will be led to a secret area with lava.  Make sure that Mario or Luigi is small.  Run under the small lava pit that's positioned under a brick wall.  After you make it under the lava pit keep going until you see a pipe.  Don't go down the pipe.  Instead, search for a secret coin block that's located one space to the left of the lava pit.  Then get on the coin block and look for a coin block that's  located one space to the right of the coin block that you are on.  Jump on next coin block and jump up to brick wall ceiling.  You should find a Warp Zone that leads to World 4. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To Warp to World 5 you must be in World 8-1.  After you pass the 3rd Hammer Bro go down the next pipe you see that points upwards.  You will be led to a secret water area.  Collect the coins and exit.  When you exit you will end up outside.  Go up the stairs and you will see a pipe that leads you back to World 5.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]You must be at least Super Mario to do this. Near the end of World 5-1, when you see two rows of floating bricks past two Red Paratroopas, hit the rightmost brick of the top row to release a vine. Smash the brick next to it, and then climb the vine. After going through the small bonus area, you will be dropped off on a pipe right next to a Warp Zone that takes you to World Six.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Near the end of world 5-2, when you encounter the trio of tiny elevators, try to go as high as you can, so you can jump off the last elevator and reach the top of the ceiling. Continue to run right, making sure to jump when the ceiling ends, and you will eventually reach the Warp Zone for World 7.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In World A-2, about halfway through the underground part of the level, you'll find a set of staircase-like blocks. You can break through the blocks above them and get on the upper portion of the area. From there, you can run and jump heading right and past the warp pipe heading outside - this takes you to a World B warp zone.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]When you are in World A-3, use the spring to get over the flagpole at the end of the stage. From there, run forwards until you reach a pipe. It takes you to World C.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In World B-4, go to the very last pipe in the level (it's next to a lava pit). Jump in the pipe and you will be taken to a Warp Zone area that will lead to World D.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In world 5-2, when you reach the three elevators, hop on the first one and use it to hit the brick immediately left of the elevator. Climb the vine that sprouts from the brick and travel through the small bonus area to reach the Warp Zone that'll take you to World 8.</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Mario All-Stars + Super Mario World</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The newer, 16-bit introduction to the 1985 classic, Super Mario Bros.[CR]This package contains both SNES launch title Super Mario World and the remade, 16-bit versions of the NES Super Mario Bros. games from the Super Mario All-Stars cartridge. There are no changes to the original All-Stars beyond the introduction of Super Mario World and a unique sprite for Luigi, retaining the same menu and title screens as the original.[CR]The game was bundled with the Super Nintendo in the US and Europe from December 1994 onwards. It was also made available separately.[CR]Games Included[CR]Super Mario Bros (1985)Super Mario Bros. The Lost Levels (1986 Japan, Unreleased in America)Super Mario Bros. 2 (1988)Super Mario Bros. 3 (1990)Super Mario World (1991)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Acceleration Glitch (Super Mario Bros. 3)[CR]Note this glitch requires the use of a SNES controller that allows you to press both Left and Right on the D-Pad simultaneously. This glitch also only works on Super Mario Bros. 3 and only on the All-Stars releases of this game. By pressing both Left and Right, Mario (or Luigi) will move very, very quickly to the right - much faster than is normally possible, even when your P-Meter is maxed. This makes it much easier to get to the goal in a small amount of time (thus meaning more points) and also makes some gaps, previously uncrossable, now crossable.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Acceleration Glitch (Super Mario Bros. 3)[CR]Power Switches are those in-game blue buttons that reverse the rolls of the coins and solid bricks and vice-versa upon jumping on top of them. During the split-second "pressed flat" animation of the button after usage, you can use Yoshi to lick it back up--when you spit it out, it will be an entirely new Power Switch that will extend the duration of the effect of the switch.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hidden White Mushroom Houses (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]If you get a certain number of coins in certain levels, you unlock a secret white mushroom house holding a powerful item. Below are the levels and the number of coins needed in each level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hidden White Mushroom Houses (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To get World 9 in the Lost Levels, beat all 32 levels (World 1-1 to 8-4) in order without using any Warp Zones and you will go to World 9. If you beat World 9 you can go to Worlds A-D (which you can access if you beat the game with warping though).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hidden White Mushroom Houses (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To access Worlds A-D, simply beat the game once through without warping.(saving and quitting does not affect this. Simply going through every level at least once on one file will do it.)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Inverted World Map (Super Mario World)[CR]Complete teh Special World, then enter the Star Road that appears. The world maps colors will be inverted and some of the enemies will have morphed into new monsters.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Inverted World Map (Super Mario World)[CR]Once you have beaten the final Special World level (Funky), the whole world map (and caves too) will be in a completely new color. Most enemies will now look different too. This looks like Dinosaur Land changing over from "summer like" to "fall like"[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Inverted World Map (Super Mario World)[CR]In Super Mario World, go to the Special World. If you sit there and do nothing for a few minutes, the Super Mario Brothers theme will start playing! It goes back to the Special World music if you leave the map by any way (going to a level or exiting). [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To ''hide'' behind scenery, simply hold down for a couple seconds while standing on a white block. Then your player can ''hide'' behind scenery for about thirty seconds.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]Complete the game and watch the ending. Now start a new game. You will start at World 1 with 28 P-Wings.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]Beat a stage with your time ending in the same digit repeated twice as the tens place of your Star total, and you'll be awarded an extra life.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]Example:[CR]With 17 stars, beat the stage with your time ending in 11.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]At the end of the game, when Bowser uses his jump attack on you, duck if you are big Mario, or stay still if you are small Mario. Bowser will break the bricks, but he won't hurt you. If you are small Mario, you can run right through Bowser and not get hurt.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]In other words, Bowser's lower half is harmless, but his upper half can still hurt you.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]Complete levels until you get to toads mushroom house, where you get to open a chest for an item. Get the item, save and exit. Now reload the file and the levels you finished will still be completed but toads house will be back so you can get the item again! :D Repeat until you have as many as you need. Also this works for the extra lives slot and the memory card game houses too.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]Try holding an item (shell, trampoline, etc) and cross the Goal line. The item you're carrying will turn into a 1-Up muhroom.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To turn a wandering hammer brother (the ones that walk about on the world map) into a white ship full of coins, collect a number of coins that is a multiple of 11. Make the tens digit in your score match the multiple of 11. Stop the timer at the end of the stage that you are playing in on an even number.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]One combination would be: 11 coins, 9,310 as your score, and the timer at 104. This only works in worlds 1, 3, 5, and 6.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]After you beat a castle or fortress you cannot normally re-enter it. To re-enter a castle or a fortress press L+R at the same time and you will enter the castle/fortress.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]Make sure you're Fire Mario/Luigi when you reach Bowser. Blast him with fireballs, but don't grab the axe just yet. Instead, wait the timer out, but make sure you're next to the axe when there's about 50 seconds left. Now get ready and time your jump on the axe so the Timer reads '000'. Once you reach Toad and the game adds the Timer to your score, you may notice that it changed from '000' to '999'. Thus the game thinks you finished with '1000' on the Timer and times that by 5. Note: this does not work on the Original NES version of the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To get the N-Spade card game to appear on the World Map. You must do gain 80,000 points as one player, and successfully beat the stage that you broke the 80,000 points with.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]Go to world 1-3 and find a potion. Now find the vase next to the brick building all the way to the right side of the level. Drop the potion and go into Sub-Space and then warp into the vase (stand on top of it and press down). You will warp to World 4.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]Go to world 3-1 and go through the door to the large waterfall with all the clouds. Now jump down and land on the platform in the center and enter. Take the potion and drop it near the vase. Enter Sub-space and warp through the vase (press down on the vase). You will warp to World 5.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]Go to world 4-2 and get the potion. Now find the vase and put the sub-space door next to it (drop it from atop the vase). Now enter sub-space and warp. Welcome to World 6.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]Go to world 5-3 and get the potion (make sure you can squat-jump to the vase, you need to get someone with a good jumping ability or use an enemy to give you a boost.)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]Put the sub space door near the vase and enter sub space and warp into the vase. You are now in world 7.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]These secret items will allow you to warp. Here are their locations.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR][B]Level 1-3[/B][CR]Find the white block near the end and crouch on to of it for 5 seconds. Then proceed to the goal, and go behind it. You will find a Mushroom house with a Whistle.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR][B]Level 1 Fortress[/B][CR]Fly over the top of the level when you find the first door with your raccoon powers, and find a hidden door at the far right on the ceiling. It leads to a warp whistle[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR][B]Level 2 Hammer Brother[/B][CR]Get the Hammer from one of the Hammer Brothers here and use it to destroy the rock at the upper right corner of the Level 2 Map. Then engage the hammer brother on the other side. You should get a chest with a Warp Whistle.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To warp to Worlds 2, 3,or 4 during World 1-2, go to the end where the 2 platforms are rising, get on the first platform, and use it to jump onto the highest structure in the middle, then jump on the next rising platform, but this time, when it reaches the top, jump onto the TOP of the level. Walk foward and drop down the small jump, and you can now warp to Worlds 2, 3, or 4 by going down the desired tube, and pressing down.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To warp to World 6,7 or 8 during World 4-2, go to the place where three blocks are can be seen (where a pipe can also be seen). Jump below the third block where you can reveal a secret block but be careful on jumping below the 1st block because you can't break it thus going to the secret warp world unless you are a small Mario. Then step on to it and break the 2nd and the 3rd block. After you have done this, go down, then jump again below the second block now (it should have been broken now). The position of the two revealed blocks must be a stair from right to left. Anyway, step on to the 2nd block then braek the 1st block and there you can see the vine going up. Climb until you reach the day light again. Get some coins if you wish and you can now see three pipes like in the secret warp Worlds 2,3 and 4. Go down your desired pipe.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]At the very end place of world 4-2 (where you can see the pipe going to the flag) jump on the long pipe and break the brick above it and go through the end and you can see the pipe going to the World 5.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To access this warp, you must be Super or Fiery Mario. Go to the pipe at the end of the level and jump on top of it. Jump up and break the block over top of the part of the pipe farthest left. Then, position Mario on the edge of the pipe, with one foot hanging off the edge. Duck, then jump backwards as far right as possible.  If done just right, Mario will slide through the pipe and the bricks. Walk over to the warp zone area and enter the middle pipe. This pipe will take you to world 5, level 1. The same area can be acessed from a pipe in the same place in 4-2. However, this is meant to be a warp zone to 5-1, whereas the 1-2 warp to 5-1 is a glitch. After completing the jump trick in level 1-2, you can also go down either of the other two pipes, both of which will take you to Minus World -1. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]This only works with mushrooms and fire flowers. Reveal a power up from under any block which contains one. Now jump onto the power up and release the A button. As Mario is transitioning to the next power up, hold down the A button, and Mario will jump in mid-air![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Go to either 1-4, 2-4,3-4, etc. and get to Bowser. Make sure you are Big Mario and try to jump over Bowser or run under him. Stand near the Axe and Bowser will start to walk towards you. As he gets near you, jump high, and touch Bowser and the Axe at the same time. If you do it correctly, you will hear the sound as if you were to shrink, but you will just flash and stay big.  Go to the next stage, and get a Mushroom. (Yes, there will be a Mushroom instead of a Fire Flower.) When you touch the Mushroom, you will shrink. Then get a Fire Flower, and you'll have Fire Power as small Mario. (Note: after you do the Bowser/Axe trick, enemies that touch you will be able to kill you when you are Big Mario. When they touch you while you are small Mario after getting the Mushroom or Fire Flower, you will turn back into Big Mario.) [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]This glitch only works in the castle levels where you fight Bowser at the end - for example, World 1-4, 2-4, 3-4, and so on. It is best to defeat Bowser with Fire Mario or Fire Luigi beforehand, as you must wait out most of the timer to execute this glitch. At the end of the castle levels, there is an axe which you must touch to end the level. If you time your jump correctly (a full jump as the timer goes from 002 to 001 often works) and land on the axe while the timer reads "000", you'll continue as normal to the usual sequence at the end of the castle. However, your timer bonus (50 points per second remaining) will be calculated as if you had 999 seconds, not zero, left on the clock. This allows for an easy 49,950 point boost! Note that this glitch, if executed on levels using a flagpole, will prevent you from earning the bonus in that level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Get to world 3-1, and become Super Mario. At the end of the level, by the staircase before the end flag, you will see two turtles coming down the stairs. Jumping over the first one and then jumping on the second one should cause it to hit the star and bounce back. From here, jump on it and keep yourself off the ground for unlimited 1-ups.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]After beating the game, if you do not turn off the console, you will return to the title screen. There, you can press the B Button to start as desired in World 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]If you just walk along the sea floor, Bloopers will never be able to kill you because they are forced back up just before they hit the floor(or you).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]If you run out of lives and want to continue then at the game over screen press and hold A then press start at 1 player (or 2 player) and you will start at the beginning of the world at which you died![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To warp to Worlds 2, 3,or 4 during World 1-2, go to the end where the 2 platforms are rising, get on the first platform, and use it to jump onto the highest structure in the middle, then jump on the next rising platform, but this time, when it reaches the top, jump onto the TOP of the level. Walk foward and drop down the small jump, and you can now warp to Worlds 2, 3, or 4 by going down the desired tube, and pressing down.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To warp to World 6,7 or 8 during World 4-2, go to the place where three blocks are can be seen (where a pipe can also be seen). Jump below the third block where you can reveal a secret block but be careful on jumping below the 1st block because you can't break it thus going to the secret warp world unless you are a small Mario. Then step on to it and break the 2nd and the 3rd block. After you have done this, go down, then jump again below the second block now (it should have been broken now). The position of the two revealed blocks must be a stair from right to left. Anyway, step on to the 2nd block then braek the 1st block and there you can see the vine going up. Climb until you reach the day light again. Get some coins if you wish and you can now see three pipes like in the secret warp Worlds 2,3 and 4. Go down your desired pipe. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]This is a pretty commonly known secret. If you touch the flagpole of any level with either 1, 3, or 6 seconds left on the ones place of the timer, you will get that amount of fireworks. For example, if you touch the flagpole with 126 seconds left on the time, you will get six fireworks! [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Well this secret is so easy. At the very end place of world 4-2 (where you can see the pipe going to the flag) jump on the long pipe and break the brick above it and go through the end and you can see the pipe going to the World 5.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]While playing, pause the game, hold Up, B &amp; A on controller 2 and unpause.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Method 1:[CR]Use any character and run right toward an enemy at full speed. Just a split second before you think you're about to get hit, jump! With good timing you'll be able to jump yet again in midair! [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Method 2:[CR]This is yet another way to jump in midair. Stand on the ground while you have 3 or 4 life units and let an enemy run right into you. You'll lose a life unit, but you'll be able to jump in mid-air.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]This is most easily performed in World 1-1. Grab a POW block, and carry it to the set of logs. Wait for a log to bog over the waterfall, then throw the POW block so that it hits solid ground. For some odd reason, this will cause the log to fly high into the air. Strange, eh?[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Go to world 1-3 and find a potion. Now find the vase next to the brick building all the way to the right side of the level. Drop the potion and go into Sub-Space and then warp into the vase (stand on top of it and press down) You will warp to World 4![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Go to world 3-1 and go through the door to the large waterfall with all the clouds. Now jump down and land on the platform in the center and enter. Take the potion and drop it near the vase. Enter Sub-space and warp through the vase (press down on the vase) You will warp to World 5![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Go to world 4-2 and get the potion. Now find the vase and put the sub-space door next to it (drop it from atop the vase) Now enter sub-space and warp. You now warped to World 6[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Go to world 5-3 and get the potion (make sure you can squat-jump to the vase, you need to get someone with a good jumping ability or use an enemy to give you a boost.) [CR]Put the sub space door near the vase and enter sub space and warp into the vase. You are now in world 7![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]When fighting Bowser in the final level of the game, his lower half will not do damage to you. That means you can avoid damage from his ground-pound attack by ducking if you have obtained a power-up at some point, or, if Small Mario, you can walk under him and through him without sustaining damage![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In the game, you need to wait until the N-Spade card game - which appears with every 80,000 points you earn - spawns and moves to the spot of a fortress on the overworld map. If you go there now and play it, the fortress will as if you had beaten it afterwards, being collapsed and unplayable. Note, however, that the bridges and locks affected by defeating the fortress normally will still not unlock or reappear, so only do this when these things are not required.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In World 3-4, about halfway through the level, you'll slide down a long hill to get on another long hill which has some Koopas on it. Take one of their shells further to the right. As the Lakitu appears above, return back to the left. There are two ? Blocks, with a pipe and some bricks between them and wood blocks on the ground. Let the Koopa shell begin bouncing between the wooden blocks and on-screen. The Lakitu's Spinies will almost always launch or crawl down to be killed by the shell; the shell will subsequently rack up more points and lives as time goes on and more Spinies are added.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]When you come across a Kuribo's Shoe, make sure that you have a Tanooki Suit equipped. Just before you jump into the Shoe, transform into a statue. Mario will turn gray and enemies will be unable to touch him.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In this game, when you normally jump on enemies in sequence without touching the ground, the points you earn will increase from 100, to 200, to 400, to 800, to 1,000, netting a 1-Up on the sixth sequential jump and all those after. However, if your fifth (the one after 800 points) jump lands on either a Lakitu or Boomerang Bro., you'll begin getting 1-Ups right then! This glitch was fixed in Super Mario All-Stars.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]At the start of World 7-1, there is a doorway you're meant to go through. Instead of doing that, run at it and jump at its top-right corner. If done with ample acceleration (and sometimes crouching just before jumping - that can help) you can glitch into the wall and skip the majority of the level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Whenever you find a white block (such as the one in 1-3 that leads to the Whistle), stand on it and hold Down until you go through it. Then enter a pipe. In most cases, once on the other side, you'll be unable to be hurt by enemies for the remainder of the level (although sometimes also invisible).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In World 3's first fortress (just after 3-3), there are several doors you're meant to go through in the level, guessing which is the correct one. If you enter a door and it's wrong, you can immediately press Up before falling to go back through the door. Further, doing this on the third and fourth doors will warp you, instead of to the gray pipe like the other doors, straight to the boss room.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Complete the game and watch the ending. Now start a new game. You got 28 P-Wings! [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Note, however, that this will not work on the Japanese versions of the game, where you simply stay at the ending screen until you turn off the console.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In Bowsers castle at the end of the game, it is possible to make it so he DOES NOT SPIT FIRE AT YOU.  This trick is easy and only requires getting to world 8 with a P-wing.  First off, use your P-wing on the map before entering the Final Castle.  YOU MUST GET TO BOWSER INTACT.  If you get to the Bowser fight room and the Bricks that he smashes through are not flush with the rest of the floor, then you are in the wrong room.  Now, when you reach Bowsers room, FLY straight up and to the left.  You will be able to walk on a wall above the screen.  Drop down on the other side. You will be in another room to Fight Bowser in.  When you drop, you will be on a door that opens to the princess.  Ignore this room and DO NOT GO TOO FAR TO THE LEFT.  If you do, you will have to fight Bowser and he will still have his Fire Balls. Fly back over the wall to the first room you were in and start the Bowser fight.  He will still throw his head back and make the sound of spitting fire, but nothing will come out.   ;)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Get to World 1-2 as Raccoon Mario, with the tail. Climb the hill at the beginning and jump over the horizontal pipe. Stand there for a bit and a whole bunch of Goombas will start walking out of the pipe. Wait for 2-3 of them to come out of the pipe, then jump ontop of one and HOLD A to fly high into the air. Now that you are in the air, use your tail to slowly glide down from the air. On you landing, be sure to land on a second Goomba. Repeat this process for as long as you can. Eventually, the points you get for hitting each Goomba will turn into extra lives. This can be done for as long as you desire to do so. [CR]This can also be done in 2-Fortress, and 7-5, but it is most notably done in 1-2. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To ''hide'' behind scenery, simply hold down for a couple seconds while standing on a white block. Then your player can ''hide'' behind scenery for about thirty seconds.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To turn a wandering hammer brother (the ones that walk about on the world map) into a white ship full of coins, collect a number of coins that is a multiple of 11.  Make the tens digit in your score match the multiple of 11.  Stop the timer at the end of the stage that you are playing in on an even number.  [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]One combination would be:  11 coins, 9,310 as your score, and the timer at 104.  This only works in worlds 1, 3, 5, and 6.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Get through an airship and defeat the boss as a frog, Hammer Mario, or Tannooki, and you'll receive a letter from the King that reads a little differently.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To get the N-Spade card game to appear on the World Map. You must do gain 80,000 points as one player, and successfully beat the stage that you broke the 80,000 points with. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]You could just use the warp whistle at level 7... [CR]If you want to go straight to level 8, you must use a Warp Whistle to proceed to the Warp Zone, then use another warp whistle IN THE WARP ZONE. You will be transported to the level 8 pipe at the bottom of the screen.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]These secret items will allow you to warp. Here are their locations. [CR][B]Level 1-3[/B] [CR]Find the white block near the end and crouch on to of it for 5 seconds. Then proceed to the goal, and go behind it. You will find a Mushroom house with a Whistle. [CR][B]Level 1 Fortress[/B] [CR]Fly over the top of the level when you find the first door with your raccoon powers, and find a hidden door at the far right on the ceiling. It leads to a warp whistle [CR][B]Level 2 Hammer Brother[/B] [CR]Get the Hammer from one of the Hammer Brothers here and use it to destroy the rock at the upper right corner of the Level 2 Map. Then engage the hammer brother on the other side. You should get a chest with a Warp Whistle.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]If you get enough coins in a certain course, you can get a White Mushroom House! [CR]A White Mushroom House in worlds 1,3,5,7 have P Wings [CR]A White Mushroom House in worlds 2,4,6 have Anchors [CR]Levels and required coins: [CR]1-4 (44 coins) [CR]2-2 (30 coins) [CR]3-8 (42? coins) [CR]4-2 (22 coins) [CR]5-5 (28 coins) [CR]6-7 (78 coins) [CR]7-2 (42? coins)[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In 8-4, as you approach the end, you'll cross a pit of lava guarded by two Parakoopas before entering a pipe. This pipe leads to a flat area (except for a dip and a pipe). Past said dip and pipe, you'll find the first Bowser, a fake one that is nonetheless difficult to beat because you cannot instantly kill him with the axe like normal - you must either dodge him, or kill him with Fire Flower fireballs. If you cannot (or do not want to), approach the gap just after the pipe while dashing at full speed - do not jump over the gap. You will run into the wall by doing so. Hold Right on the D-Pad for a while until the first fake Bowser is on-screen (you do so because the camera will not scroll otherwise). When he is about one-third of the way across the screen, you can then just hold Down and you'll automatically scroll past him, still stuck in the wall, although the camera is not scrolling. Once past him, you are free to continue on - you are not required to defeat this Bowser.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In World 1-1, go right until you see a Red Koopa boxed in by some bricks. Hit the second brick on the bottom and obtain the Mushroom from it. Then break the third brick and either the leftmost or rightmost one, trapping the Red Koopa on a single brick. You can then stomp on it, and then on its shell like in the original Super Mario Bros.'s infinite-lives trick, infinitely bouncing it back on the wall before you can touch the ground.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]This glitch only works in the castle levels where you fight Bowser at the end - for example, World 1-4, 2-4, 3-4, and so on. It is best to defeat Bowser with Fire Mario or Fire Luigi beforehand, as you must wait out most of the timer to execute this glitch. At the end of the castle levels, there is an axe which you must touch to end the level. If you time your jump correctly (a full jump as the timer goes from 002 to 001 often works) and land on the axe while the timer reads "000", you'll continue as normal to the usual sequence at the end of the castle. However, your timer bonus (50 points per second remaining) will be calculated as if you had 999 seconds, not zero, left on the clock. This allows for an easy 49,950 point boost! Note that this glitch, if executed on levels using a flagpole, will prevent you from earning the bonus in that level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Before you touch the flag at the end of a level, make sure your coin total is a multiple of 11. (00,11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88 or 99). Touch the flag when the last digit of your remaining time is the same digit as your coin total and you'll receive a 1-Up.[CR](For example, 55 coins and 275 time left, or 11 coins and 081 time left) [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To warp back to World 1, you must be in World 3-1. Near the end of the stage, jump onto the spring and fly over the flagpole. When you land, run forwards, and you'll find the warp pipe that takes you back to World 1.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]When you're in World 1-2, jump onto the bricks at the top. Run forwards, and you'll go past the pipe to exit the stage. Keep running, and soon enough, you'll find the warp pipe that takes you to World 2.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To warp to world 3, you must be in World 1-2. When you reach an area where there is a pipe, a few bricks, and a Steel-Shelled Koopa, hit the first brick on the left. A beanstalk will pop out. Climb up the beanstalk, and at the top, run forwards until you reach the warp pipe that takes you to World 3.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To Warp to World 4 you must be in World 1-2.  When you get to the moving platforms jump onto the platform.  While on the platform get a running start then jump to the to the small brick ceiling then jump again to the next brick ceiling.  Keep going until you see 2 pipes.  Go down the pipe that's on the far left.  You will be led to a secret area with lava.  Make sure that Mario or Luigi is small.  Run under the small lava pit that's positioned under a brick wall.  After you make it under the lava pit keep going until you see a pipe.  Don't go down the pipe.  Instead, search for a secret coin block that's located one space to the left of the lava pit.  Then get on the coin block and look for a coin block that's  located one space to the right of the coin block that you are on.  Jump on next coin block and jump up to brick wall ceiling.  You should find a Warp Zone that leads to World 4. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]To Warp to World 5 you must be in World 8-1.  After you pass the 3rd Hammer Bro go down the next pipe you see that points upwards.  You will be led to a secret water area.  Collect the coins and exit.  When you exit you will end up outside.  Go up the stairs and you will see a pipe that leads you back to World 5.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]You must be at least Super Mario to do this. Near the end of World 5-1, when you see two rows of floating bricks past two Red Paratroopas, hit the rightmost brick of the top row to release a vine. Smash the brick next to it, and then climb the vine. After going through the small bonus area, you will be dropped off on a pipe right next to a Warp Zone that takes you to World Six.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Near the end of world 5-2, when you encounter the trio of tiny elevators, try to go as high as you can, so you can jump off the last elevator and reach the top of the ceiling. Continue to run right, making sure to jump when the ceiling ends, and you will eventually reach the Warp Zone for World 7.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In World A-2, about halfway through the underground part of the level, you'll find a set of staircase-like blocks. You can break through the blocks above them and get on the upper portion of the area. From there, you can run and jump heading right and past the warp pipe heading outside - this takes you to a World B warp zone.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]When you are in World A-3, use the spring to get over the flagpole at the end of the stage. From there, run forwards until you reach a pipe. It takes you to World C.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In World B-4, go to the very last pipe in the level (it's next to a lava pit). Jump in the pipe and you will be taken to a Warp Zone area that will lead to World D.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In world 5-2, when you reach the three elevators, hop on the first one and use it to hit the brick immediately left of the elevator. Climb the vine that sprouts from the brick and travel through the small bonus area to reach the Warp Zone that'll take you to World 8.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Once you defeat Bowser, quickly enter this code while the princess is being freed.  Hold the buttons until the credits show up. A very strange Easter egg I must say.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Enter a level with [B]Yoshi[/B], [B]Cape Mario[/B], and a [B]Fire Flower[/B] in reserve. Position yourself under a berry in a way that you can get the fire flower [I]and[/I] get the berry at the same time. If you happen to eat the flower and the berry at the same time, the game will freeze. Several things have been reported while using this glitch. Sometimes when the game freezes, your coin count will rise until you quickly have 99 lives. Press Start and Select to exit the leve. One person's game froze, horizontal lines appeared on the screen, and weird music kept looping over and over again. Then came a buzzing noise, and he was returned to the file select screen, with his file deleted. Thankfully, that's not normal. Even so, this is an interesting glitch to exploit every once in a while.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]For this glitch, you'll need to get Fire Mario and Yoshi in Yoshi's Island 2. Near the end of the level, there is a Piranha Plant in a pipe near a Dragon Coin. Stand on said pipe, about 2/3 of the way across. Pay attention to the Rexor to the right. When he is walking left and about 3/4 past the Dragon Coin, crouch, then press X+A simultaneously. Mario will jump off of Yoshi as Yoshi attempts to eat him, and you'll get some weird glitchy item in your item storage. (If you did it wrong, the game just crashes horrifically.) If you summon this item during a level, and then grab it, the level is then completed, provided that Mario does not die while attempting to walk off-screen. Note that the orb only works once, and you need to get it again to complete another level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]In Chocolate Island 5, play the level as normal. Past the midpoint in the level, you'll begin to see a bunch of Spinies trapped in unmoving blocks (which are removed by a silver P Switch). Get the nearby blue and silver P Switches and try to drop one on top of the other so that they completely overlap each other; when done properly, attempting to grab one will grab both. Nearby, also, are some yellow flip panels, with a blank spot in the center. Get in the center and run right as much as you can. Let go of the switches and, suddenly, ? Blocks will begin appearing, spewing a multitude of Yoshi Eggs. Once a Yoshi hatches, these eggs will spew 1-Ups instead.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]First all you need to do is find a switch ( the kind that changes the square outlines into brown blocks ). You also need to be on a yoshi. Normally when you hit the switch, it will flatten and disappear. When you jump on it, quicky turn around and eat it with your yoshi, if you do it fast enouph, you will have it in the yoshis mouth. You can spit it out and use it again.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Complete The secret world. (With Stage names Such as Awsome  and Tubular.)[CR]And then Enter the second Star road that Appears after you Complete "Funky" And the world Map will Have A diffrent Color Pallete and some enemies will look different.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Beat a stage with your time ending in the same digit repeated twice as the tens place of your Star total, and you'll be awarded an extra life. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Example:[CR]With 17 stars, beat the stage with your time ending in 11.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]If you sit at one of the levels in Special World for about 2 minutes, you'll start to hear a Super Mario Brothers remix![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]Try holding an item (shell, trampoline, etc) and cross the Goal line. The item you're carrying will turn into a 1-Up mushroom.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] [CR]When you beat a castle you normally cannot enter it again.  [CR]Go to the castle you want to play again and Press L+R at the same time. </plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Mario Kart is a racing video game, developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo for the SNES. It was the first game of the Mario Kart franchise. It was launched in Japan on August 27 1992, in North America on September 1 1992 and in Europe on January 21 1993. It was also released for the Virtual Console in Japan on June 9 2009, North America on November 23 2009, and in Europe on April 2 2010.[CR]In Super Mario Kart the player chooses one of eight characters from the Mario franchise. Each has different capabilities unique to them. During races players can pick up power ups to help them win the race.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Super Mario Kart the player is tasked to take control of one of the characters and finish before anyone else. The racers race in a go-kart. The player's viewpoint during the race is behind his/her's go-kart.Game ModesThe very first race is about to begin. And... GO![CR]Super Mario Kart is split into two singleplayer modes (Mario Kart GP and Time Trial) and three multiplayer modes (Mario Kart GP, Match Race and Battle Mode). In Mario Kart GP one player playes against seven CPU controlled characters in three cups of five races. At first there three cups that can be played on two difficulties (50cc and 100cc). By finishing first in all three cups on 100cc difficulty, a new cup is unlocked, the Special Cup. By winning the fourth cup on 100cc difficulty, the 150cc difficulty level is unlocked. In time trial mode the players race alone, with the goal of beating the other players time.[CR]In multiplayer, Mario Kart GP is the same as in singleplayer, except now there are 6 CPUs and 2 player controlled characters. In Match Race, two players compete against each other without any CPU players on any track in the game. In Battle Mode two players still go head to head against each other without CPUs on the track, but this time on special tracks created specifically for this mode. Each player starts with three balloons which are to be destroyed by the other player. The first player to have all of his balloons destroyed losses the battle.DriversMarioLuigiPrincessYoshiBowserDonkey Kong Jr.Koopa TroopaToadItemsGreen Shell, which can either be fired in a straight line forward or dropped into a stationary position.Red Shell, which acts as a homing missile and will attack the driver in front.Banana Peel, similar to the green shell, with the exception that its forward shot is fired in an arc.Feather, which allows the user to jump once - useful for getting over obstacles or finding shortcuts.Mushroom, which gives the user a temporary speed boost.Star, which makes the user invincible to everything, and also causes others to spin out on contact.Lightning Bolt, which shrinks all other drivers and causes them to drive slower.Coin, which adds a few coins when used. 100 coins will NOT award an extra life.Ghost, which can steal one item from another driver.Shrinking Mushroom, which will cause the shrunken effect to anyone who touches it (only usable by CPU controlled Princess and Toad)Fireball, a stationary weapon that spins around in a small circle (only usable by CPU controlled Bowser)Egg, similar to a banana. (Only usable by CPU controlled Yoshi)[CR]Circuits[CR]Mushroom CupMario CircuitDonut PlainsGhost ValleyBowser CastleMario Circuit 2Flower CupChoco IslandGhost Valley 2Donut Plains 2Bowser Castle 2Mario Circuit 3Star CupKoopa BeachChoco Island 2Vanilla LakeBowser Castle 3Mario Circuit: 4Special Cup[CR]The Special Cup is unlocked after obtaining gold medals in the Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup, and Star Cup on 100cc difficulty. Once a goal medal has been earned on 100cc in the Special Cup, the difficulty 150cc is unlocked.Donut Plains 3Koopa Beach 2Ghost Valley 3Vanilla Lake 2Rainbow Road[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Small Racer[CR]When at the character select screen (only in racing) hold Y and push A and your chacter will become small. This will not effect speed whatsoever, it will only make it so your opponents can run you over to slow you down. Hold Y and push A to make yourself big again.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Small Racer[CR]Go to Time Trial or 2P Match Race, put the cursor on Mushroom Cup and press: L,R,L,R,L,L,R,R,A. If you haven't unlocked Special Cup already, it'll be available now.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue playing after you lose (Battle Mode)[CR]When you're on your last balloon, hop over a banana peel. After the music changes and the screen darkens, you can still drive your kart around. You can even pick up items, use them, and the Star music will play if you obtain it.This glitch stops working if you stop your kart.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue playing after you lose (Battle Mode)[CR]When playing Battle Mode with another player, obtain a Feather. Once earned, you use it to jump to the out-of-bounds area on the course. If you jump far enough, your character will be dragged back to the course but, for unknown reasons, remain invisible on your opponent's screen (and sometimes yours), with only the balloons visible, making it much harder for them to find you.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue playing after you lose (Battle Mode)[CR]When you get a Mushroom item, approach a wall on the track, preferably a corner wall that juts into the track. As you approach it, release B to decelerate and then press A to use the Mushroom and use L/R to hop "into" the wall. Once the wall is bumped, only hold L/R to keep the boost. The boost will keep going forever so long as you don't bump into anything else on the course.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue playing after you lose (Battle Mode)[CR]You'll need to obtain a Feather item for this. Once obtained, go ahead of the starting line and make a U-turn. Once in line with the starting line, back up to the side of the track and somewhat ahead of the starting line. Drive and leap forward over the lava at the edge of the track, onto the stony area beyond it, thanks to the Feather; be sure to land behind the starting line as well. You'll be dragged back to the track by Lakitu, and mistakenly labeled as being one lap ahead.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue playing after you lose (Battle Mode)[CR]On this track, when the lap begins, drive forward from the starting line and make a U-turn some point thereafter. Drive back to the starting line and, as you approach it, hop off of the left side (from your view - right on the track map) of the track and fall and "die" behind the finish line. When Lakitu grabs you back up, he'll drag you forward and past the finish line, and mistakenly glitch the game into thinking that you've just done a whole lap. You can only do this every other lap at the most, though, so only on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th laps in succession, or on the 2nd and 4th in succession.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue playing after you lose (Battle Mode)[CR]This trick only works on courses which have walls of blocks to the right or left of the starting line (whichever side is towards the center of the track). When a race begins, drive to the right of the finish line and begin ramming it with your kart, about in line with the actual starting/finish line. You'll suddenly begin to warp ahead laps, albeit somewhat randomly depending on where you hit the wall. It is best to hop a lot whilst bumping the wall, and aim for the center of the colored segment that is in line with the wall.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue playing after you lose (Battle Mode)[CR]When you get a Feather item, drive through the course as normal. As you near the finish line, make a hard drift to the left so that you're almost off the left side of the course and nearly perpendicular to the course when you finish the lap. Use the Feather at this point and you should hop in the air and back behind the finish line before you "die". Lakitu will drag you back on to the course and you'll get the extra lap counted.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Continue playing after you lose (Battle Mode)[CR]You'll need a Feather item for this. Once obtained, drive around the course as normal. As you pass the starting line, begin a hard drift to the left or right (whichever is towards the out-of-bounds area of the course's outer edge). As you approach the wall bounding the course, use the Feather. If your drifting is tight enough, you'll leap up, over the wall to the out-of bounds area, and back in without actually needing to be dragged back to the course. (Sometimes, even if you are dragged back, this glitch will still work.) You can then cross the finish line again to get the extra lap counted.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Camera Pan[CR]Choose any character and go to any time trial and finish it without making any mistakes.  Now, when you watch the little replay clip of your race, press L or R to make the camera swing around your character.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Camera Pan[CR]If you finish three races in the same place, you'll earn an extra continue.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Camera Pan[CR]When you have a ghost that you'd like to save in Time Trials, hold L, R, and Y at the menu screen that displays after you've completed a Time Trial race and press X. The name of the course on which the ghost was saved will be highlighted in yellow on the Course Select menu. To race against the ghost you saved, choose the course(the one highlighted in yellow) and hold L or R while pressing B when the screen asks ''Is this OK?'' and the arrow is pointing to ''Yes''.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Camera Pan[CR]Select 1P Time Trials and then on the select driver screen, press START on 2nd controller. It will bring up a driver select for COM. Select who you want it to be. You can now race a ghost driver anytime.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Camera Pan[CR]This speed boost can occur at the beginning of a race. When the three lights begin to count down, if you press the Acceleration button just before the second light lights up, and you hold it until the race starts, you get a boost of speed. If this speed boost is timed and positioned right, it can easily put you in first place right from the start.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Mario returns in this incredible new role-playing adventure! His latest rival is Smithy, a menacing creature who causes fear and treachery in the Mushroom Kingdom. Mario must recover seven stars and repair the Star Road before he can make his way to Bowser's castle for a final confrontation with Smithy. Powerful weapons, sinister spells and other useful items help Mario to complete his harrowing journey. New friends and old allies support him along the way. Even Bowser lends a hand![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hidden command[CR]Notice: this only works in the SFC/Japanese version.[CR]Open the menu screen (by pressing X), then press Down, Up, Right, Left, Select, Start, Select, Start, B. Kinopio (Toad) pops up and asks to see your status, giving you little tips and tricks.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Spell transfer glitch[CR]Any spell that is learned by leveling up can be transferred to a different character.  But the level up has to occur using an invincibility star.  When you jump to open the chest with the star, press the menu button to open the menu mid jump.  In the menu switch the character you want to learn the spell with the character that is going to level up.  Kill enemies until that character levels up.  After the invincibility wears off and the level up process finishes the the spell they learned during the level up will be given to the character that you moved into their previous position.The glitch occurs because the game is confused and thinks the character that leveled up is still in the old party slot, so it adds the spell to the magic list of the character currently in that slot.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 2D Mario from Super Mario Bros. 1[CR]One time only in the game you can change into a 2D Mario walking around on a 3D landscape. It is prety cool. The image turns sideways when you tern diagonal. In booster tower, I think it's right after the room with a switch that opens a pasage of booster pass. There is a large curtain near the exit. Go in the right side and coming out the right side wont do it but going in the right and coming out the left causes the transformation.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 2D Mario from Super Mario Bros. 1[CR]In the uppermost right corner, you can see F-Zero and Star Fox racers in Hinopio's shop on Barrel Volcano.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 2D Mario from Super Mario Bros. 1[CR]These two popular characters play no significant role in the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 2D Mario from Super Mario Bros. 1[CR]To find Link, return to the Rosa Inn (same place where you played with that Gaz girl) after you find the 2nd star. He'll be upstairs sleeping in the bed. Try to talk to him and the Zelda Mystery noise plays.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 2D Mario from Super Mario Bros. 1[CR]To find Samus, go to the Mushroom Kingdom after securing the 5th star. Go into the castle, then  to the guest room. Samus will be sleeping in the bed. If you talk to her, she says she's resting for Mother brain.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 2D Mario from Super Mario Bros. 1[CR]In Toadstool's room examine the right side of the fireplace to find "Toadstool's ???" and get an amusing comment from the maid along with a free Mushroom.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 2D Mario from Super Mario Bros. 1[CR]When you reach Booster Tower and get to the top where you talk to *some-what spoiler character* through the door. After this conversation look in the box where Booster and his Snifits are talking. There is a samus action figure.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Level Ups[CR]Look for a place where a star is next to a save point. Save, then get the star, level up as many times as you can. Then die (in game) and you will still have your levels, aswell as be able to use the star again :-).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Level Ups[CR]Easy Level up[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Level Ups[CR]After you acquire Geno, put him in your party. After he learn the move Geno Whirl, enter battle. Use Geno Whirl and a tornado like wind will come onto the screen. Push [B] Y [/B] right before it leaves the screen for 9999 attack points. [CR]Note: You will hear a crackling sound if you did it right. This does not work on all enemies (ie bosses).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Level Ups[CR]When you are on the path going towards Rosa town, get to the section where all of the ShyGuys are standing on top of the treasure boxes. Go to the bottom right side of the screen to the exit. Hit the box next to the door and get a few coins (but do not empty it, leave some in) then go through the exit. As soon as you go through the exit, go back through and hit the box more times (still don't empty it). Then just repeat this until you have a many coins as you want, it won't go empty![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Level Ups[CR]Many who search for all of the Hidden Treasure Boxes are stumped by the one in the Mushroom Kingdom Castle.[CR]Ordinarily, you can find any hidden Treasure box at multiple points in the game. The one in Mushroom castle, however, has only 1 oppurtunity, and that is at the beginning of the game. On your first visit to the castle, be sure to jump on Toad's head and ride him to where the door is. You can now jump onto the ledge right above the door and find a Treasure box that can't be found at any other point in the game.</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Mario World</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Mario World (known in Japan as Super Mario World: Super Mario Bros. 4) is a side-scrolling platformer developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System on November 21, 1990 (in Japan), August 31, 1991 (in North America), and April 11, 1992 (in Europe).One of the launch titles of the SNES (and bundled with early systems in North America), Super Mario World is the fifth main game in the Super Mario series. (starring Nintendo's mascot, Mario, and his brother, Luigi). The game follows both Mario brothers as they explore Dinosaur Land (known for its large amount of dinosaurs) to find and defeat the evil Koopa king Bowser (and his seven underlings, the Koopalings) while rescuing Princess Toadstool.Along with new abilities (such as the "Spin Jump"), a new power-up (the "Cape Feather") and more obstacles, the game introduces dinosaur companions (known as Yoshi) that Mario and Luigi can ride. Yoshi, known for using their long tongues to snare and eat enemies, have become a fan-favorite among the series (giving them their own games and spin-offs, most notably this game's prequel).Special bundles of the SNES in 1994 included a compilation cartridge mixing Super Mario World with Super Mario All-Stars. The only difference in this version is a new sprite set for Luigi. The original game was later ported to the Game Boy Advance on February 11, 2002 as Super Mario World: Super Mario Advance 2. Along with a special version of the original Mario Bros., the port includes a variety of differences, including Luigi as a selectable character (who now has unique features, such as his floating jump from Super Mario Bros. 2), new voice acting, and the ability to save anywhere. The original game was also digitally re-released in Nintendo's Virtual Console platform for the Wii (on February 5, 2007) and Wii U (on April 26, 2013).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Super Mario World plays like a standard sidescrolling platformer (similar to the previous Super Mario Bros. games), where players must guide Mario or Luigi through over 75 stages, split into over seven unique areas (or "Worlds"). Each stage has a goal to reach, usually a giant moving goalpost (known as Giant Gates) at the rightmost part of the level (rarely a special mysterious exit reachable by a keyhole, requiring Mario/Luigi to carry a large key).YoshiYoshi's first appearanceMario can ride Yoshi in all stages of the game except for castles and fortresses, and can make Yoshi shoot out his long tongue to snare and eat enemies.Power-UpsThroughout each level (usually in special Blocks), Mario and Luigi can find power-ups to give themselves special abilities:Super Mushroom - Transforms into Super Mario/Luigi, giving them a taller stature while allowing them to get hit once without losing a life. They can also break some Blocks by hitting it from below and Spin Jump on Rotating Blocks to break them. This power-up glides across the ground before collected and can sometimes be found by running over special areas (like some bushes). All Yellow Exclamation Blocks contain this power-up. Running over checkpoint gates as regular Mario/Luigi automatically puts them in Super form.Fire Flower - Transforms into Fire Mario/Luigi. In addition to the benefits of the Super Mushroom, they can now throw fireballs (which can damage and destroy most enemies) by tapping the X or Y buttons. Performing a Spin Jump also throws fireballs on both sides of them. This power-up is usually stationary before collected. In the GBA remake, getting hit while in Fire form changes them into Super form (similar to Super Mario Bros. 3).Cape Feather - Transforms into Cape Mario/Luigi. In addition to the benefits of the Super Mushroom, they can now glide across the air by holding the X or Y buttons. In addition, making a running jump allows them to fly through the air (allowing them to sail with the cape by holding Up and Down on the joypad). This power-up floats left and right downward before collected. All Green Exclamation Blocks contain this power-up. Jumping on Super Koopas cause them to drop a Cape Feather.Somewhat similar to Super Mario Bros. 3, players can have the ability to store spare power-ups for use at a later time. If a player collects two of the same power-up (or if they collect a Super Mushroom while in Fire or Cape forms), it will be placed in the Reserve Box at the top of the HUD. Getting hit (or pressing the Select button in-game) causes the item to slowly descend from the Reserve Box. Also new to the game are Roulette Blocks, which can carry either of these power-ups (along with the Starman power-up below) and is chosen when the player hits the block.In addition, Mario and Luigi can find two rare power-ups that do not permanently transform them, instead temporarily giving them a special ability:Starman - Grants them temporary invincibility, allowing them to bump onto any enemies to defeat them. Unlike previous games, players can chain combos by bumping onto enemies in quick succession (giving them easier extra lives). Usually found in Roulette Blocks.Power Balloon - Temporarily inflates them allowing them to hover in the air and gradually float upwards. Found in only four levels and is not necessary for normal game progression (only required for reaching secret exits). [CR][B]Worlds:[/B][CR]Dinosaur Land.There are over 75 levels in the game, each split into multiple areas (or "Worlds"). These worlds (along with the Koopaling boss in that world):Yoshi's Island (Iggy)Donut Plains (Morton)Vanilla Dome (Lemmy)Cheese Bridge (Ludwig)Forest of Illusion (Roy)Chocolate Island (Wendy)Valley of Bowser (Larry)While each world can be progressed in a narrow path, the game features an abundance of secret exits and alternate paths leading to hidden levels, bonus areas, and special shortcuts. Some of the more notable secret levels include the four Switch Palaces (allowing players to unlock special Exclamation Blocks for use as platforms and a way to earn power-ups), the Butter Bridge path (an alternate way to traverse both the 3rd and 4th Worlds), the Valley Fortress (a way to skip most of 7th World and end up at the back door of Bowser's Castle), and the Top Secret Area (a hidden one-screen level in Donut Plains that gives players free power-ups and a Yoshi).Bonus WorldsIn addition, there are two secret areas only accessible through special Star Roads hidden throughout the game: Star World and Special Zone.The Star World (up in the clouds) acts as a special "fast travel" area between most of Dinosaur Land (from the Donut Plains to the Valley of Bowser). There are five Star Roads that lead to it, each with their own accompanying level. Reaching the secret Keyhole exit in each level opens up a path between the level and another Star Road (eventually making a circular path). All levels in this area also have a hidden red, blue, or yellow-colored baby Yoshi (allowing players to gain Yoshis with special abilities).By completing both normal and Keyhole exits allows a new Star Road entrance to the Special Zone: eight challenging levels that must be completed sequentially (each with a level name resembling '80s slang for something positive). Completing all eight levels gives them a one-way Star Road back to Yoshi's House while changing the color scheme of the overworld (giving it a Fall apperance) and giving some enemies a Fall theme (Koopa Troopas wearing Mario masks, both jumping Piranha Plants and Beanstalks becoming haunted pumpkins, and Bullet Bills resembling crow-like Pidgits).While four of the Star Roads have no exit routes in Dinosaur Land (unless previously unlocked), the fifth Star Road immediately links to the front door of Bowser's Castle, allowing players to skip a large majority of the game.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]Amazing Flying Hammer BroA flying enemy, throws hammers.

Hold the buttons until the credits show up. A very strange Easter egg I must say.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Berry Freeze[CR]Enter a level with [B]Yoshi[/B], [B]Cape Mario[/B], and a [B]Fire Flower[/B] in reserve. Position yourself under a berry in a way that you can get the fire flower [I]and[/I] get the berry at the same time. If you happen to eat the flower and the berry at the same time, the game will freeze. Several things have been reported while using this glitch. Sometimes when the game freezes, your coin count will rise until you quickly have 99 lives. Press Start and Select to exit the leve. One person's game froze, horizontal lines appeared on the screen, and weird music kept looping over and over again. Then came a buzzing noise, and he was returned to the file select screen, with his file deleted. Thankfully, that's not normal. Even so, this is an interesting glitch to exploit every once in a while.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Berry Freeze[CR]For this glitch, you'll need to get Fire Mario and Yoshi in Yoshi's Island 2. Near the end of the level, there is a Piranha Plant in a pipe near a Dragon Coin. Stand on said pipe, about 2/3 of the way across. Pay attention to the Rexor to the right. When he is walking left and about 3/4 past the Dragon Coin, crouch, then press X+A simultaneously. Mario will jump off of Yoshi as Yoshi attempts to eat him, and you'll get some weird glitchy item in your item storage. (If you did it wrong, the game just crashes horrifically.) If you summon this item during a level, and then grab it, the level is then completed, provided that Mario does not die while attempting to walk off-screen. Note that the orb only works once, and you need to get it again to complete another level.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Berry Freeze[CR]In Chocolate Island 5, play the level as normal. Past the midpoint in the level, you'll begin to see a bunch of Spinies trapped in unmoving blocks (which are removed by a silver P Switch). Get the nearby blue and silver P Switches and try to drop one on top of the other so that they completely overlap each other; when done properly, attempting to grab one will grab both. Nearby, also, are some yellow flip panels, with a blank spot in the center. Get in the center and run right as much as you can. Let go of the switches and, suddenly, ? Blocks will begin appearing, spewing a multitude of Yoshi Eggs. Once a Yoshi hatches, these eggs will spew 1-Ups instead.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Berry Freeze[CR]First all you need to do is find a switch ( the kind that changes the square outlines into brown blocks ). You also need to be on a yoshi. Normally when you hit the switch, it will flatten and disappear. When you jump on it, quicky turn around and eat it with your yoshi, if you do it fast enouph, you will have it in the yoshis mouth. You can spit it out and use it again.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Inverted World Map[CR]Complete The secret world. (With Stage names Such as Awsome  and Tubular.)[CR]And then Enter the second Star road that Appears after you Complete "Funky" And the world Map will Have A diffrent Color Pallete and some enemies will look different.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Extra Life[CR]Beat a stage with your time ending in the same digit repeated twice as the tens place of your Star total, and you'll be awarded an extra life. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Extra Life[CR]Example:[CR]With 17 stars, beat the stage with your time ending in 11.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Extra Life[CR]If you sit at one of the levels in Special World for about 2 minutes, you'll start to hear a Super Mario Brothers remix![CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Extra Life[CR]Try holding an item (shell, trampoline, etc) and cross the Goal line. The item you're carrying will turn into a 1-Up mushroom.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Extra Life[CR]When you beat a castle you normally cannot enter it again.

				<title_clean>Super Mario World 2 - Yoshi's Island</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]One of the game's earlier levels[CR]Developed and published by Nintendo, Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island represents a departure in the standard platforming formula that Super Mario had become known for. In this prequel to the other Mario titles, players no longer control Mario; instead, they control Mario's green side-kick, Yoshi. Mario himself is in the game and always with Yoshi, but it's not the plumber that players had grown used to; instead Mario returns as a baby, riding on Yoshi's back as Yoshi journeys through various levels on his way to Baby Bowser's castle to save Mario's brother Luigi. Not only did this represent a major shift for the Super Mario series, it also marked a shift in visual design as well. Yoshi's Island used much more colorful palettes than other titles and appears much more stylized. Most objects and environments have much bolder lines and larger contrasts in colors, which gives itself a much more artistic, childish, and hand-drawn feel. Yoshi's Island was originally released on the Super Nintendo.[CR]In 2002, Yoshi's Island was re-released on the Game Boy Advance under the name Yoshi's Island: Super Mario Advance 3. Yoshi's Island received its first sequel in 2006 on the Nintendo DS, titled Yoshi's Island DS. The story was a follow up to Yoshi's Island, though not a direct sequel, and not nearly as well received.[CR]There are 6 different worlds in Yoshi's Island, each one with a different theme. World 1 is a field theme, World 2 has a forest theme, World 3 is a jungle, World 4 contains a variety of themes, World 5 has a snowy theme, and World 6 has a dystopic theme. World 6 is the final area of the game, where Yoshi faces off against Kamek and young Bowser.[CR]Yoshi's Island was the first major Mario title that did not contain any form of a warp zone, allowing players to transport themselves further into the game. To complete Yoshi's Island, players were required to complete all of the game's 48 regular stages, though getting 100% completion was a much more daunting task with the many bonus levels featured in the title.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story begins[CR]Our tale begins as a stork carries two peaceful young children over the tranquil ocean. All seems well, however, danger rears its ugly head as the evil magikoopa Kamek arrives, swiping Baby Luigi. He attempts to kidnap both infants, but fails, leaving baby Mario to plummet down into the ocean. Mario falls towards a small island in the great expanse of water, home of the Yoshis, an island called Yoshi's Island. Luckily for our young friend, he lands safely on the back of a bright green yoshi. Mario somehow makes Yoshi and his multi-colored friends aware of the catastrophe, and the entire tribe of dinosaurs enlists in the fight. Together, these yoshis will in turn carry Mario through dangerous terrain and, against all odds, rescue Baby Luigi and defeat Kamek. This is exactly what happens, as well. After a long, perilous journey across Yoshi's island's most threatening terrain whilst being pursued by Baby Bowser's minions, the Yoshi's arrive at Baby Bowser's castle. They fight with great strenght against both Bowser and Kamek, and come out the victors. Baby Mario and Luigi are both safe, and all is well in the world.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Yoshi scrambling to get baby Mario back.[CR]Yoshi's Island introduces a plethora of new moves for Yoshi now that he has become the main character. Many of the moves that he has since become known for were first developed in this title, including his ability to hover by kicking his feet furiously for a few seconds. Yoshi's ability to create eggs from enemies and then use them as weapons was also introduced in this title. Throughout his adventures, Yoshi can accumulate up to six eggs that can be used to reach far off switches and collectibles or to simply eliminate enemies. Occasionally, players will have to get keys or other objects that will replace an egg in the line up following YoshiShooting eggs.[CR]to unlock or advance in a level. Unlike other Mario titles, Yoshi does not have a finite amount of health (he can be killed instantly by pits, lava, spikes and other such hazards though). Instead, players will have to rescue Baby Mario within a certain time-limit whenever Yoshi is hit. Throughout a level, the timer will refill back to the default 10 seconds, but a player can collect objects, such as bouncing starmen (not to be confused with ones from other Super Mario titles that provide invulnerability), that will increase the limit up to 30 seconds.[CR]Hidden throughout each level are a number of extras which players can collect. Part of the challenge of each level includes collecting these items, which are red coins and flowers. Each level has 20 red coins and 5 flowers. Tthe red coins simply serve as a collectible, but the flowers give the player an increased chance of playing a mini-game once they complete the level. If a player collects all of the items in a level and finishes with 30 seconds on their timer, they receive a perfect score of 100 for that level.[CR]Some levels require Yoshi to collect a transformation power-up that transforms Yoshi into a vehicle for a limited amount of time. Yoshi can become a helicopter, letting him fly; a car, which increases his speed, but he must avoid enemies; a submarine, which lets him shoot torpedoes that home onto enemies; a train, which rides on rails, but must avoid other enemies also on the tracks; and a mole vehicle that can dig through certain obstacles. During any vehicle segment, players don't have to worry about losing Baby Mario, but still must complete the segment before the transformation wears off. When a player successfully reaches the end of the segment, Yoshi and Baby Mario are reunited and the level continues.[CR]On a few rare occasions, Yoshi has a chance to nab a "super star," altering Baby Mario into the 'Super Baby Mario' form, also causing Mario to don a cape. This marks a turn of events for the game where the player controls Baby Mario rather then his scaly chauffer. Baby Mario can run at the speed of light up walls and across ceilings and has an improved ability to jump and glide. Many times, Mario can nab hard-to-reach items and plenty of coins. This power up is seldom seen, and only lasts for a very short period of time, so make good use of it.A stage map where players pick the level they wish to play.[CR]At the end of each level, players jump through a goal hoop that will randomly reward the player with a mini-game. After that, players are scored out of 100 points depending on how many red coins they collected, how many of the five hidden flowers they found throughout the stage (which will also improve the chance of entering a mini-game) and how much time is left on the countdown timer. After the player receives their score, the Yoshi carrying Baby Mario hands him off to the next Yoshi that will carry Baby Mario through the next level. There six worlds altogether, each of which consists of eight levels that players must clear in order. Players can also unlock hidden bonus stages that add an extra challenge. Players can pick any stage they've previously beaten, in an attempt to get a better score or find any other hidden secrets. Each world has two castle areas where players have to face off against a boss which all have different weaknesses players must discover and are not necessarily as "generic" as the bosses seen in other Mario titles that all have similar weaknesses.Extra Stages[CR]The extra stages are a series of optional stages that can be accessed if the player reaches a standard of points in specific worlds. Perfect scores are not required, however, the standards are not easy, and so a high score is required for most levels in a world. The extra stages prove to be much more challenging then the main stages throughout the game, only the elite could conquer a few of these stages.[CR]These stages are:Extra 1: Poochy aint StupidExtra 2: Hit that switch!!Extra 3: More Monkey MadnessExtra 4: The Impossible? MazeExtra 5: Kamek's RevengeExtra 6: Castles - Masterpiece setMini Games[CR]On every level, the player has a chance to play one of many mini-games. Some stages only allow access to mini-games through the end of stage roulette, however, there are special doors on some levels that give accessA bonus challenge[CR]to games. Certain levels will have small hut like buildings with locked doors. If the player can locate the key to the door, they can go inside and participate in a mini-game. These mini-games can provide the player with bonuses if they are successful.[CR]Throwing Balloons: In this mini-game, Yoshi and the bandit will toss a balloon to each other across the screen. As they toss the balloon, it will continue to grow larger and larger. Once it gets so big that it pops, the character holding it loses.[CR]Popping Balloons: popping balloons has Yoshi competing against the bandit to see who can pop the right balloon. The characters run across the small level, ground-pounding all of the balloons. Whoever pops the correct balloon is the winner.[CR]Gather Coins: Once again, Yosih is pitted against the bandit. This game has a cannon which moves across the screen, and shooting out coins into the air as it moves. The player must try and collect as many coins as possible. Once the game is over, the character with the most coins wins.[CR]Watermelon Seed Spitting Contest: This game puts Yoshi in combat against the bandit, both wielding watermelon seeds. Pots are scattered across the screen, each one with a watermelon in it. The characters collect the watermelons and eat them, then, as if they were a machine gun, spit out the seeds at eachother. Both characters have life, and whoever loses all of their life first is the loser.[CR]Game Boy Advance version[CR]On September 22, 2002, Nintendo released the GBA port of Yoshi's island, titled Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island. Essentially, the games were identical aside from the obvious change in resolution. Nintendo added voice samples from the Nintendo 64 game Yoshi's Story, and changed the music in the GBA version of the game.Yoshi fighting Bowser off in the distance.[CR]One major change to the game was the addition of six new "secret levels" that a player could unlock once they had completed the game. These secret levels are completely seperate from the extra levels found in the SNES version, though those levels are also present in the port. In order to get these levels, players were required to obtain a score of 100 on all of the games 60 levels by collecting all that can be found on each level. Once they have these scores and have defeated bowser, a yellow box will appear on the level select menu with the word "secret" in it.[CR]The secret levels are as follows:Secret Level 1: Exercise in the SkiesSecret Level 2: Mystery of the Castle?Secret Level 3: Go! Go! MorphingSecret Level 4: Fight Toadies with ToadiesSecret Level 5: Items are fun!Secret Level 6: Endless world of YoshisThe GBA version of the game[CR]There were also a few changes to the GBA version. In Extra level 3, 'More Monkey Madness,' a single red coin was removed taking the total on the level from 21 to 20.[CR]The GBA version of Yoshi's Island also featured a remake of the classic arcade game Mario Bros., as did other game boy advance Mario ports. Yoshi's Island was the first of the Mario advance series to allow players to put the game boy into a 'sleep' mode, which allowed them to put the game boy into powersave at any time without losing progress.[CR]Game Credits[CR]Executive Producer - Hiroshi YamauchiProducer - Shigeru MiyamotoDirector - Takashi TezukaDirector - Toshihiko NakagoDirector - Shigefumi HinoDirector - Hideki KonnoChief Programmer - Toshio IwawakiMain Programmer - Masaru NiiMain Programmer - Kiyoshi KodaMain Programmer - Satoru TakahataMain Programmer - Kazuaki MoritaMain Programmer - Yuichi YamamotoMain Programmer - Yasunori TaketaniCourse - Level Design - Yasuhisa YamamuraCourse - Level Design - Kenta UsuiCourse - Level Design - Yoshihiro NomotoCourse - Level Design - Eiji NotoCharacter Design Shigefumi HinoCharacter Design - Hisashi NogamiCharacter Design - Masahiro IimuraCharacter Design - Tomoaki KuroumeGraphic Design - Yoshiaki KoizumiSound Composition - Koji KondoTechnical Support - Takao SawanoMap Director - Hidequi KonnoArea Director - Katsuya EguchiProgram Director - Toshihiko NakagoMain Programmer - Shigeki Yoshida[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Ninja Boy</title_clean>
				<plot>One day a spaceship came down from the heavens and into the skies of Chinaland. It began broadcasting an image of peace. Soon Emperor Chin was holding a peace conference with the space ship's leader, Rub-A-Doc. Rub-A-Doc visited with some of the other places in the world before departing to the heavens and leaving the world. All seemed peaceful however there seems to be trouble starting up, strange monsters have been seen throughout Chinaland. Could the increase in monsters be somehow related to the recent visit from Rub-A-Doc? The ninja masters of Mount Edin, Jack and Ryu are sent to investigate...[CR]Super Ninja Boy is an action RPG for one or two players. In a two player game, each player controls either Jack or Ryu. In a one player game, only Jack appears.A second player may join at any time by visiting a convenience store.[CR]As mentioned, this game is an RPG and contains familiar RPG elements such as equipping differing kinds of weapons, equipment and gaining levels. The Ninja Boys are treated as a single entity and so these statistics are shared between Jack and Ryu with equal values. Battles with the enemy, either through random encounters or visible on the map is where the action starts. The characters enter a side-scrolling 'battle mode' where they may jump, fight, use their special techniques, items and spells... as well as activate various 'bonuses' on the battlefield by breaking open the bonus boxes. A battle is over and experience points awarded when a pre-determined number of enemies are defeated or the Ninja Boys are defeated.[CR]When bosses are encountered, the gameplay changes to a turn-based system. Each turn, commands are given to Jack &amp; Ryu, which include usage of special items and skills accuired during the game, who then perform actions based on those commands. The enemy's turn takes place the same way. The battle ends when one side of the conflict runs out of hitpoints.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]Enter these passwords to unlock bonus features:</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Nova</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Nova is a shoot 'em up from Taito that is also part of the Darius series, in which the human race is fighting against an invading wave of robotic piscine aliens lead by Belzer. In Japan, the game is known as Darius Force. It is the follow up to the 1991 SNES game Darius Twin and, like that game, is loosely based on the Arcade version of Darius II (known as Segaia outside of Japan).[CR]Super Nova is novel among Darius games for allowing the player to choose between three ships (the Silver Hawks, pride of the human fleet) with different load-outs: The green Silver Hawk of Darius; the blue Silver Hawk of Darius II; and the red Silver Hawk, which was created especially for this game.[CR]Like other Darius games, there are branching paths that the player chooses between. There are three terminal points to this branching, which amounts to three separate endings with their own unique boss. Similarly, almost every boss in Darius Force (as is also true for the Darius series in general) is based on a type of sealife.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 7,7,5,6 and 6 out of ten. Mike Weigand, who gave the score of 6, wrote, "There are some excellent elements here (like great weapons, and at times, astounding graphics), but the one-hit wonder aspect that sends you back a ways in each level when hit is very aggravating".[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR] Pause the game[CR](Japanese version; Darius Force, confirmed, unconfirmed on NTSC/PAL versions)</plot>

				<plot>In the game the drivers compete against each other or the computer in racing around several top-view indoor off-road truck tracks of increasing difficulty. Good results earn the player points to continue in the championship and money with which to upgrade their truck or buy more nitro boosters. The goal is to reach the end of the season with the most money earned. Continues are available but whereas players can get extra money in the arcade version, in the home versions, the player's money is reset to 0. This is one of the first games where the player could upgrade his or her vehicle by earning points or money (although in Atari Games' Sprint series, one could upgrade their racer using wrenches), a system that is used in most arcade-style racing games today.[CR]Licensing:[CR]The Super NES version was notable for prominently featuring the Toyota brand; the name and logo were displayed on various tracks, and pre-race music was inspired by the "I love what you do for me Toyota" jingle that was used by the company's marketing campaign at the time of the game's release. This version also lacked any licensing or reference to Ivan Stewart, replacing him instead with the late Mickey Thompson in the gray truck.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Slow opponent[CR]The CPU driver will drive much slower if you input the same initials assigned to that driver.[CR]Never finish 4th place again.[CR]Plug in both controllers, and start a 2 player game. When you start racing, the blue truck will sit idle, for it is controlled by the 2nd player. Therefore, you can always finish 3rd or better and be able to go onto the next event.[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Off_Road#The_Baja[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Off Road: The Baja (Super 4WD: The Baja in Japan) is a third-person off-road rally driving game sponsored by Ivan "Ironman" Stewart and features The Baja 1000 race: a course that covers roughly 1000 miles down Mexico's California Baja peninsula.[CR]It is the sequel to the original Super Off Road, otherwise known as Ivan "Ironman" Stewart's Super Off Road. Unlike its predecessor, which was released in the Arcades and on multiple home systems, The Baja was created specifically for the Super Nintendo. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player has to balance avoiding too much damage to the vehicle, which is caused whenever the player veers off into rougher terrain, and navigating their way to each leg's checkpoint within the time limit. Money is added by finding bags of cash on the field and reaching the checkpoint quickly, and subtracted whenever they collide with another vehicle. This money can then be spent on upgrading the player's 4WD rally vehicle.[CR]The player can take part in the Mexico 250, Ensanada 500 and Baja 1000 races, each progressively longer and more difficult than the last, or practice any of the first four legs of the Baja 1000 in the Pre-Run practice mode. Progress is saved via a password system.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Play Action Football</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Play Action Football is a follow up to the game NES Play Action Football. The camera angle for the game is isometric and top-down. Because the angles are diagonal, players move towards the top right of the screen as opposed to moving forwards or upwards as with traditional football games. The game features three different modes of gameplay: High School, College, and NFL. Each mode features a quick play option for both 1-2 players, but College and NFL has season long modes as well.High School[CR]The High School mode allows the player to create a school of their choice, including team name, and color of uniform. This mode is the simplest of the three modes in terms of both controls and play selection. Only 8 plays are allowed on offense and defense in order to keep the game to its high school roots.College[CR]College mode has a season mode in which the player can choose knock-off schools from the NCAA. Mascots and school nicknames are not allowed as Nintendo was not being able to secure licenses from both the NCAA and NFLPA. At the end of each game the player can read a newspaper that would highlight the biggest games of the previous week including the top 20 schools in the nation. 16 plays are allowed for both offense and defense as well as expanding the control set from High School mode.NFL[CR]The NFL mode features the most expansive move list and play selection of the three modes. All of the 28 NFL teams (at the time there were 28 teams) are featured with mascots, however without the license from the NFLPA, real-life players could not be added. The season mode is just as robust as the College mode, featuring a full season mode with proper divisions and a playoff match resulting in the Super Bowl.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Guranteed Blocked PAT[CR]There is a glitch on the PAT that will allow you to block the kick each and every time your opponent goes for one after the touchdown.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Guranteed Blocked PAT[CR]Have your player line up over the center before the snap.  When the holder shouts "Ready," press down and the Y button to jump over the line of scrimmage.  If you do this correctly, you will be between the center and the holder.  Do not touch anyone yet, as you get an offsides penalty.  [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Guranteed Blocked PAT[CR]When the holder shouts "Set", press the START button, which brings you to the pause screen that shows the score, quarter, etc.  Wait for one second and press the START button again.  You will still be inbetween the center and the holder, but the game doesn't acknowledge your presence!  This makes the kick easy pickings now.  When the ball is snapped, wait for the ball to pass through you and into the holders hands.  You should easily be able to press Y again to jump onto the holder and snuff the kick.

				<title_clean>Super Punch-Out!!</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Punch-Out!! is the sequel to the original game on the Nintendo Entertainment System, Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!. Although Super Punch-Out!! does not contain the likeness of Mike Tyson, it brings over familiar characters from the first Punch-Out!!! The returning characters are Super Macho Man, Bald Bull, and Mr. Sandman. Super Punch-Out!! was released in October 1994 in North America, in March 1995 in Japan, and on January 26, 1995 in Europe.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Super Punch-Out!! has similar gameplay to the original. The player faces a single opponent, and is able to sway left and right, and execute both right and left punches to the body and head. From there, however, there are several subtleties to the gameplay that make Super Punch Out!! a much deeper experience than the original.Basic Punching[CR]The four normal punches players can throw vary in speed and strength. There is an inverse relationship of how fast a punch is to how powerful it is. From quickest and weakest to slowest and most powerful, the order of the punches is as follows: Left Jab, Left Body, Right Jab, Right Body. Mixing the punches up accordingly may yield extra hits or extra damage, so finding the proper mix of punches can yield quicker K.O. times for time trials.[CR]As in the original Punch Out!!, they player can throw a powerful uppercut, but instead of stars, this time there's a meter that fills up as they fight. This meter does not deplete as players use it. Instead, getting hit by an opponent depletes the meter. (The amount is based on the damage of the punch.) The uppercut, furthermore, is simply one of four available "special" punches. Players can also deal a vicious hook to the body, and rapid punches to both the head and body. The difference between the head and body special blows is the speed and power with which the blows connect, with shots to the head being slightly quicker and less powerful and shots to the body being slightly slower and more powerful.Counter Punching[CR]Counter-punching is much more fleshed out and flexible this time around. In the original Punch Out!!, there were a few rare instances during which players could hit their opponent just as he was about to land a punch (throwing a body punch at Von Kaiser or Great Tiger as they crouch to launch an uppercut, or tagging Bald Bull in the head just before he throws a jab). In Super Punch Out!!, the counter punch's rate of success is much higher and the appropriate techniques are called out in the game's tutorial. When the opponent is about to throw a left-handed punch, the player can counter with a right-handed punch, and vice versa. One must also take the height of the blow into consideration. If he's about to throw a jab or hook at the player's face, they counter with a jab to his face; similarly, if he's about to throw a hook at their body, or crouches for an uppercut, they must counter with a body blow. The challenge is in reading the opponent's tell--each punch's tell is distinguishable from one another, but sometimes only subtly so (most difficult being the difference between a hook to the face and a hook to the body). Mastering the counter-punch is key to speedy victories and--in some cases--survival, as a successful counter-puncher ends up nullifying many opponents' attacks before they can even be unleashed.Dizzy Spells[CR]Successful counter-punching or otherwise dominant performances will sometimes yield a "dizzy" animation, in which the opponent either doubles over, sways from side to side, or otherwise stumbles about. Hitting the opponent with a power punch during a precise moment in these "dizzy" animations may yield an instant knockdown and, in rare cases, result in a full 10-count and victory.Other Differences[CR]Super Punch-Out!! sports a Time Attack mode, which allows players to fight against fighters from any circuit they have beaten to try and improve their K.O. times.[CR]Unlike the original, in Super Punch Out!!, speech bubbles will appear from both sides of the screen, representing orders and hints coming from the opponent's coach. These often clue the player in to which technique their opponent is about to unleash, giving them time to take proper action.[CR]Techniques employed by the fighters in Super Punch Out!! require a much higher level of suspension of disbelief in relation to the original Punch Out!!. Several fighters use weapons and what would normally be illegal blows and tactics, including but not limited to: overhead blows; grabbing and throwing; kicking; spitting; headbutts; juggling balls; elbows; and a walking stick.[CR]Super Punch-Out!! contains four circuits. However, unlike Mike Tyson's Punch Out!! the final boss does not have its own circuit. The circuits--and the fighters within--consist of:[CR]Minor Circuit Gabby Jay Bear Hugger -- uses illegal two-handed overhead strikes Piston HurricaneBald Bull[CR]Major Circuit Bob Charlie Dragon Chan -- uses illegal kung fu kicks Masked Muscle -- uses illegal spitting and headbuttsMr. Sandman[CR]World Circuit Aran Ryan -- uses illegal grab-and-throw tactics Keike Kagero -- uses illegal strikes via his long hair Mad Clown -- uses illegal juggling balls which he throws at Mac, as well as illegal two-handed overhead strikesSuper Macho Man[CR]Special Circuit Narcis Prince Hoy Quarlow -- uses illegal Kung Fu kicks and strikes with his walking stick Rick Bruiser -- uses illegal elbows Nick Bruiser -- uses illegal shoulder charges[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]When Super Punch-Out!! was released it was praised for the style of its graphics, the simple controls and the diversity of the characters.[CR]IGN said that the game overall was great but that it lacks the appeal that the original game has.

The Japanese version was released in July the same year.[CR]The game appeared on the Wii U's Virtual Console in North America on December 26, 2013.[CR]Opponent Details[CR]Below are statistics for the opponents, grouped by circuit:Minor Circuit[CR]The Minor Circuit is the easiest circuit in the gameGabby Jay[CR]Gabby Jay is the first opponent in the Minor Circuit.

				<title_clean>Super Putty</title_clean>
				<plot>Putty Moon, the place where all the putties live, has been taken over by an evil wizard named Dazzledaze. Putty has been banished from the moon to the planet below. To return to Putty Moon and oust the evil wizard, Putty enlists the help of some robots ("bots") to build a skyscraper that will reach up to Putty Moon.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]:[CR]In Putty, the player controls a blue blob with eyes. Putty has many moves that he could use to attack enemies or to navigate around the level. These abilities include being able to stretch out upwards, downwards, left and right to access far-off ledges. He also has the ability to inflate. This allows him to provide a cushioned landing for any falling bots. Over-inflation also acts as a "smart bomb", with Putty bursting, killing all of the enemies on the screen, whilst reducing his health in the process.[CR]Putty is able to form part of himself into a fist, allowing him to punch left or right to dispatch enemies.[CR]Putty is also able to melt into the floor, making him invulnerable and also allowing him to absorb enemies, recovering a small amount of health in the process. With certain enemies in the game, such as the clockwork orange, once Putty has absorbed one he is then able to morph into the enemy's shape to use its abilities.[CR]A final ability of Putty's is being able to create a mug of coffee from part of himself, which will distract bots and make them stand still.[CR]The levels in Putty are laid out vertically, with the screen scrolling up and down. The levels contain regular platforms, as well as "solid" ledges that Putty can not move through, and other special tiles including electric platforms and bounce pads.[CR]The aim of each level is to rescue a set number of bots within the time limit. In the early sections of the game, the bots simply stand around the level. Putty has to absorb them, and carry them to the level's goal (either a flying saucer or an elevator). Later on in the game, the bots will jump around platforms, often falling to their death.[CR]Invariably each level also contains various enemies. These enemies include Terminator carrots, Scouse sausages and sword-wielding spacemen. The enemies will attempt to hurt Putty in various ways. The attacks from some of the enemies will also hurt any bots that Putty is carrying at the time. If a bot is hurt four times it is killed, causing the player to have to find another bot to absorb.[CR]Putty is also able to use powerups that are scattered around each level. These range from simple points bonuses to temporary invulnerability, to Uncle Ted. Once this latter powerup is collected, a man with a Hammond Organ name Uncle Ted appears, and proceeds to play a tune, causing all of the enemies in the level to freeze.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Super Putty[CR]Stage Skip[CR]Pause the game, then press R, A, L, L, Y. Now you can skip to the end of any stage by pressing SELECT.[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putty_(computer_game)[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Super R.B.I. Baseball is the first appearance of the R.B.I. series on the Super Nintendo.  It features 700 major MLBPA players and has all 28 teams along with the complete 1994 roster, but doesn't feature an MLB license, instead the teams nicknames are omitted and team colors are altered.[CR]There are six modes to choose from: Exhibition, Home Run Derby, Defense Practice, Playoffs, League, that has the player compete against each team in the game in succession and Game Breaker which lets the player choose from 17 scenarios to win the game under certain conditions.  They can also choose different Division Champion line-ups that range from 1989-1993 or All-Star Lineups from 1989-1994.[CR]The graphics of the game are presented in a cartoonish-way and the stadiums are "authentic", but altered to distinguish themselves from the actual MLB stadiums.  The game doesn't feature a battery back-up like many other baseball games, but Series championships can be saved using passwords.  Jack Buck also lends his voice talent to the game calling play-by-play commentary.</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Scope 6</title_clean>
				<plot>Super Scope 6 was the game the was most often bundled with the Super Scope. It is played purely using the Super Scope, and unlike Duck Hunt, has several other features, including turbo fire and many varying games wrapped into one. The Super Scope was meant to bring the light gun into the next generation. Though it never gained in popularity, probably due to its size, it still produced great games and carried the light gun further on. This bundled game is no exception![CR]This game is actually two in one, which then turns into almost a six in one, and then into almost twelve to eighteen in one, with many variations of each game and several different modes! This left me with a sigh of relief. Thank goodness, I wasn't going to have to play the same game repeatedly, shooting the same stuff again and again.[CR]I was then taken back a bit, because every different mode is basically a disguised same mode. They are just masked versions of the same game. Different, same, either way you don't feel bored or tired of playing the same game with a different feature.[CR]Using the Super Scope (mouse, of course, on the emulator) just feels natural, and no longer having to remember and execute complex combinations or other buttons is a plus.[CR]Though each of the games/levels starts out easy and slow, the game play can be increasingly difficult and frenetic and very fun! Bring along a friend (using a controller or another mouse) and the fun is enhanced as you're both shooting toward the same goal![CR]The graphics are pretty good for being a small game and take full advantage of the SNES. Yet they feel way too cartoony for such a gun-like device and I would have liked to see at least one more instance of a military style game. The sound feels the same way, a bit too jumpy. The gun sound will get very repetitive and annoying.[CR]My only other complaint is the fact that the bullets are delayed in every game, leaving some of the faster levels impossible to react and shoot fast enough; also always having to lead your targets is a bit annoying. Good thing is, your gun is very very accurate and you'll have no instance when you are off target! If you enjoy shooting games or like light guns, this game is for you![CR]I give Super Scope 6    7 bullets out of 10!     Happy Shooting![CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]Depending on which game you select, directions differ. In either case you'll have to calibrate your aim and test your shot. Your choices for games are:[CR]Blastris: - An action oriented, Block-shooting, Tetris.[CR]Blastris A, plays like the original Tetris! Pieces, instead of falling down the screen, fall from left to right. You can't rotate the pieces, but rather shoot specific tiles so they fit. As usual, when a row, or in this case column, is filled it will disappear. Meet the goal and advance through each level, growing in difficulty![CR]Blastris B, is a bit different.[CR]In Type A your task is to clear the tiles already presented to you. In order to do this you must make three or more tiles touch horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, not unlike Columns. Type B Plays in the same method, except you're given no original rows![CR]Mole Patrol is Whack'A'Mole...... on the MOON! You are to shoot these fast moving critters in a hurry. Either to rack up a high score per level, or rack up a set score![CR]Secondly there is...[CR]Lazer Blazer - A futuristic military game, set for you to win for your country![CR]Intercept, 1 or 2 players, has you shooting varying missiles for a range in score depending on its speed, shape, and length. Blow them out of the air to make sure that no more than 5 missiles meet their target, otherwise you lose. Lead the targets so that your missile has time to intercept![CR]Engage which has several difficulty settings, each uniquely difficult, has you flying to defend your ship and base from enemies in a very F-Zero feeling world. Your mission is to take out the set enemy units in the area and work your score up to the next wave. Try not to take too much damage or you can kiss your ship goodbye![CR]Confront, also only with varying, but unique levels, has you stay on a base turret and take the enemies' mechs head-on. This mode is completely identical to Engage, except you're not moving and targets are a bit more random and fast. [CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]Activate Super Scope When the game loads press Esc. Go to Config and click Add-Ons then Super Scope. Your cursor will change to a crosshair and you're ready to fire![CR][B]Hints:[/B][CR]Lead your Target[CR]Remember that the bullet is delayed and will travel in a 3-D like environment. Shoot accordingly! [CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Invincibility in Lazer Blazer Game[CR]Use a controller and tap X repeatedly until you get hit five times. Then replace the Super Scope and play[CR]Reviewer: Aggort[CR]http://www.consoleclassix.com/snes/super_scope_6.html[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Shadow of the Beast</title_clean>
				<plot>"Ugh..."[CR]There are no two ways around this fact: This game sucks. Period.[CR]Shadow of the Beast is a platform shooter (more platform than shoot, though) for the SNES released in 1992 by Psygnosis. The Psygnosis name got me to try it, but it didn't keep me around for long.[CR]The title screen is fairly cool. It mixes Gangsta Graffiti style text with some sort of ancient Egyptian... glyphical... things. It looks nice, but it has nothing to do with the game itself, as far as I can see.[CR]See, you're actually a demon. Well, in the continue screen (which you'll see a lot), you look like one. In the gameplay, you look like a bluish gray hunchbacked critter that may or may not be a duck with his bill on backwards.[CR]The game's graphics are excellent. Definitely a cut above, considering that it was only released in 1992. Characters are well animated when they walk around, punch you, kick you, shoot you, kill you, and when you die. However, it seems Psygnosis got a bit lazy, as most of the enemies die simply by falling off of the screen Koopa-style. They also fall off the screen if you dive down a ladder while they're attacking you, which makes for some comical escapades when a half dozen bats rain down every time you go up or down a level in a dungeon.[CR]However, these animations make for a handicap. There's about a half-second delay when you try to turn around before you can start running. Most enemies are just as fast as you (some are faster), so if you have to turn around to get some breathing room, you're already dead. Your jumping power is tantalizingly weak, and usually leaves you a pixel short of where you want to jump to, forcing you instead to spend thirty minutes going in a wide circle and fighting five or six nearly unbeatable bosses in the interim.[CR]Although most enemies die in one shot (be it a punch, a kick, or whatever), some of them are insane. For example, there are lots of bats in trees in the game. The bats sit in trees until you're under them, then all fifty of them fly around in bizarre acrobatic circles. You cannot get past them without getting hit, because they literally come down in waves that leave the only passable gap tantalizingly outside of your (very weak) jumping power.[CR]These bats seem to be physically impervious to all forms of damage. Punch them, they hurt you. Kick them, they hurt you. So you go find your gun - it looks like an interesting crossbreed between an alien death ray and a roll of paper towels - and come back. Lo and behold, you can shoot them all day and only kill a few. Not that your gun can shoot all day. See, there's a number after the picture of the gun on the screen, but that number doesn't change as you fire. When your ammo runs out for no apparent reason, you can't help but ask yourself what that number means. You also can't switch back to your punch attack once you get the gun, so you can't save ammo for real fights.[CR]These bats really got to me. Let me explain the video game monster hierarchy to you here: Demon beats Bat. Even if that demon is a blue demon who thinks he's a duck and the bat is really big (which the bats in this game aren't; they're normal, bite-sized bats), demon always beats bat. The fact that the demon has an alien death ray pretty much seals the deal. That's just the way the world works. In fact, bats are the at the bottom level of the video game food chain, along with rabbits and houseplants.[CR]As you progress through the game, you gain powers by beating strong enemies, then lose and regain them for no apparent reason for the duration. After defeating one boss, I found I could hurl electric death from my hands, and actually kill those stupid bats for a while. However, just as I needed that electric death, I had my gun back for some reason. When it ran out of ammo, I didn't have my electric attack anymore. When I went through a door, I could suddenly shoot little tornado-like objects.[CR]The best part of the game has to be the Continue screen. It emphasizes all the things the game does, right and wrong. Every time you die, you see the most beautifully rendered screen in the game: Your broken demon (you actually look like a demon here) body, with the Shadow of what I suppose is the titular Beast passing over you. I never got to see the Beast, but his Shadow looks somewhat like a pterodactyl-ish dinosaur. For all I know, it could just be one of those invincible bats.[CR]The continue screen also has the string ''CONTINUE: 9'' on it. What does the 9 mean? Nothing. It's not a countdown, because it doesn't count down. It's not how many continues you have, because you actully have around 5.[CR]The game just isn't fun. If you really want to play a demon, pick up a game like Demon Crest. It's actually fun. Shadow of the Beast has great graphics, but gameplay is crippled by controls that feel like you're in full-body cast and downright lousy design. Too many oversights (the non-functional ammo counter, the mysterious 9 on the Continue screen), and too many no-win situations. Nothing in the game can be called interesting or compelling by any measure of the words.[CR]Nothing I can say about this game will adequately capture just how bad this game sucks. I would only recomend you play this game only if you want to fully understand how not fun it is.[CR]To make matters worse, the SNES cartridges just don't make good paperweights or doorstops. Super Shadow of the Beast has no reason for existence.[CR]If you see this game cheap, it costs too much. If you see this game free, it's not worth it. If it's free and comes with candy, use your own judgment, but that better be pretty good candy.[CR]Reviewer's Score: 1/10, Originally Posted: 04/18/04[CR]Reviewer: ArchDuke[CR]http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/snes/review/R72116.html[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Slam Dunk</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Slam Dunk, known in Japan as Magic Johnson no Super Slam Dunk, is a basketball game licensed by Earvin "Magic" Johnson, the LA Lakers' legendary points guard. The game has a dynamic camera view that turns around to place the net at the top of the screen. It was released on the SNES in Japan and the US in the summer of 1993.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Scoring:[/B][CR]Super Slam Dunk is a basic basketball game. Magic Johnson himself appears before every game and gives commentary as to which team has the advantage and why. The game has all the teams from the NBA at the time, but no NBA licence. Therefore, there are no team logos and the teams are only referenced by the city name. The last names of the players for the actual NBA teams are used as well.Game Stats[CR]The game primarily uses an vertical viewpoint. During the face-off the view is from the side of the court, and after the face-off the camera moves around to face the net. When the other team gains possession and moves the ball out of their zone, the camera moves around again so as to face the other net. Basic statistics are tracked during the game and since player names are used it's possible to know who scored the most over the course of the game.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]Intense Playoff Action[CR]In Super Slam Dunk there is no option to play an entire season, only a single exhibition game or a playoff showdown. In the playoffs, there are 8 teams. The player starts by choosing a team and playing against the rival. Win or lose, the player must then next pick another team to play as from one of the other match-ups. This continues through to the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final.[CR]This means there is a strange system where the player's team could be playing as one team in the quarter-final, only to turn around and choose to play against that team in the semi-final. There is no best of 7 series, only single games are played. A password system is used to save the player's progress.[CR]Game Options[CR]Game Options[CR]Super Slam Dunk has relatively sparse options. The game can be played 1 player, 2 player, or auto-play, where the computer plays itself. The period length can be set to 2, 5, 8, or 12 minutes. Finally, fouls and the music can be turned on or off.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Soccer</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A soccer game released in 1991 for the SNES, Super Soccer features 16 national teams loosely based on the real 1990 World Cup teams in exhibition matches and a tournament mode that pits the player's team against all other nations in search for the coveted World Champion Cup. Those who manage to beat all other teams find a final surprise as the powerful "Nintendo All-Stars" team challenge those who try to claim the cup for themselves.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is a very simple soccer game with shooting, low and high passes, a slide and a stronger shoulder tackle for defense as well as the ability to select the team's formation and composition from a pool of different players with different if barely noticeable attributes. The game's most innovative element is an unique view, positioning the camera behind one goal and displaying the entire pitch in a vertical perspective thanks to the SNES's mode 7. Due to the use of this view, most of the movement was straight up or down from the player's perspective and in the case of multiplayer forcing one player to run downwards into the invisible field "ahead" of him.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Some of the players found in the game are named after real soccer players like Germany's #7 "Lotar", based on real player Lothar Matth&#228;us.In the same vein the colombian goalkeeper is named "Loco", referencing famous goalkeeper Ren&#233; Higuita's nickname "El loco" and with the added bonus of being the only goalkeeper almost immune to tackles and slides, effectively allowing him to actually try and score goals of his own.Being a pretty simple game, the player is guaranteed to score if they approach the goal from the very edge and shoot straight ahead into the corner.Known in Japan as Super Formation Soccer. Four sequels were released exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]At Title Screen, choose ''Tournament'', then ''Continue'', then enter these directional pad codes: [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Play as Romania[CR]Use these passwords to play as Romania in the Tournament[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Play as Romania[CR]Use these passwords to play as Yugoslavia in the Tournament[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Play as Romania[CR]The password screen is found by choosing 'Continue' on the main screen.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Play as Romania[CR]At the Title Screen select Tournament, then Continue.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] No Red Cards[CR]When the referee takes out a red card keep holding [B]L[/B] and [B]R[/B] and the game will act as if he gave you a yellow card.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Give the opponent a red card.[CR]When the referee is approaching you to give you a yeallow card, hold L and R.

				<plot>The player must first choose one of eight national football teams, followed by a star player from a choice of four available for each team. In the game a win is needed to progress to the next game. A draw will end as a 'game over', with no option for penalties, but a chance to continue by restarting the game in which a win was not achieved. Each opposition team is chosen according to a tier strategy, with the player's team removed:[CR]1. Spain and France.[CR]2. Netherlands and Brazil.[CR]3. England and Italy.[CR]4. Argentina and Germany.[CR]Thus, playing with Germany, the first two games will be Spain or France in some order, the second two games will be Netherlands in Brazil in some order, the third two games will be England and Italy in some order, and the seventh game will be Argentina. The game is completed when all seven other teams have been beaten. The level of difficulty increases the further you progress. In addition, the game notices when individual team players score a hat trick. Scoring hat tricks has the effect of increasing the difficulty as well.[CR]The game gained some notoriety for giving you the ability to use violence (including punches, flying kicks and shirt pulling). You could get away with this without giving away a free kick as long as the referee was either far enough or knocked onto the floor. The referee punishes every foul with a yellow card. Red cards occur at the third, seventh, and eleventh fouls, although every so often the game appears to miscount. No fourth red card is given by the referee. Besides the rough play, the game introduced the super shot, which occurs with 30 seconds remaining or less and when the score is tied or the player is losing by 1 goal. The star player chosen kicks a shot that pushes the goalkeeper into the stands.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Ace Striker Team[CR]At the title screen press Up, X, Left, Y, Right, A, Down, B, Left, Up, Right, Down, Select, and Start.[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Champ[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Star Wars</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Star Wars is a sci-fi action platformer (including vehicular combat levels) developed by Sculptured and published by JVC for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in June 1, 1992. The third platformer based on the 1977 film Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, Super Star Wars has players controlling the farmboy Luke Skywalker (with the option of playing as rogue smuggler Han Solo or Han's Wookiee companion, Chewbacca, on certain later levels), as he attempts to save a group of freedom fighters (the Rebel Alliance) from the Galactic Empire by embarking on a mission (along with Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi) to rescue a rebel leader (Princess Leia Organa).[CR]The game was later published by Lucasarts in Europe and Victor Interactive in Japan, as well as re-released in North America by Nintendo. The game received two sequels (based on the film's two sequels) over two years: Super Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back and Super Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. On August 10, 2009, the original game was again re-released in North America on the Wii via Virtual Console for 800 Wii Points ($8). Another platformer based on the film was released on the Game Boy Advance in 2004 (Star Wars Trilogy: Apprentice of the Force).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Super Star Wars features fifteen different levels. Eleven of these use either Han, Chewbacca, or Luke, unlocking each character as the plot progress. Each character comes equipped with a gun that can be upgraded throughout the course of the game that allows increased rate of fire and in one instance, homing ability. However, there is little difference between the characters until Luke reaches receives his lightsaber which functions as the game's only melee weapon. Luke may switch between his pistol and lightsaber at any given time. There are also two landspeeder levels, where Luke must get to his next destination while shooting Jawas. In the final two levels, Luke must pilot an X-Wing and destroy tie fighters and destroy the Death Star. Both the landspeeder and X-Wing levels use Mode 7 graphics.[CR]Super Star Wars is notorious for it's difficulty with numerous onslaught of quick enemies, unforgiving pitfalls, difficult boss fights, and lack of any password system or other game saving feature.WeaponsLaser BlasterFlame BlasterProton SeekerRapid Ion GunPlasma Wave BlasterLightsaberPower-UpsPlasma Shield - Temporary invulnerabilityThermal Detonator - Clears screen of enemiesHealth (Small and Large) - Regains healthTime - Increases time to finish the level.

At the very beginning of the second set of rocks, jump off the edge of the cliff and face to the left. Luke will land on a ledge and enter a small cave area. Ignore the falling rocks and shoot the blaster in the air to reveal several extra lives. Collect them and lose your current life to restart the level at the top of the cliff. Repeat this procedure to collect up to ninety-nine lives.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Ninety-nine lives[CR]In the Inside Sandcrawler level, immediately before the half way location when you cross the drilling spikes, jump forward into a wall instead of jumping to the sliding doors to the lasers. There will be two guns and three or four hearts located there. Besides the ledge with the flamethrower, shoot at the opening side. There will be an extra life.</plot>

If entered correctly, you will hear a tone. Select ''Game Start'' and press Start. Wait for the title ''Star Wars'' to fade off. Then, when the introduction comes on, use the Control Pad and L and R to rotate and scroll the words around the screen. You can also move the Star Destroyer around, too. That is all the code does.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Change Intro[CR]At any time during stages where you control one of the heroes (not during stages where you control a vehicle IE snow speeder or spaceship), press and hold down the following buttons: A, B, X, Y and Down. While holding these, press Start to access a Sound Test. Use Left and Right to cycle through the tunes, press A to select the desired tune and listen to it. While still playing the selected tune, you can press Start to resume gameplay. Whatever tune you selected in the Sound Test will be playing in place of the stage's normal music! In effect, you could be in the middle of say, stage one with the boss theme or the ending theme playing instead of the Imperial March! Remember, on stages where you pilot vehicles this code will not work.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Street Fighter II: The New Challengers is the fourth iteration of Capcom's genre-defining Street Fighter II originally released in the Arcades in 1993 on Capcom's new CP System II board. It follows Champion Edition (which first allowed players to play as the four Grand Masters Sagat, Balrog, Vega and M. Bison) and Turbo: Hyper Fighting (which increased the speed and balanced the game further). The most notable addition are four brand new characters: Cammy, Deejay, T.Hawk and Fei Long. It would eventually be followed by Super Street Fighter II Turbo Edition, considered the definitive Super Street Fighter II.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]This remake of  Street Fighter II featured a new scoring system that kept track of combos, first attacks, and reversals. Additionally, four new characters join the returning twelve characters from the original. Super Street Fighter II is also the first game in the SFII series to give full move sets to the boss characters. Previously in Street Fighter II: Champion Edition and Street Fighter II: Turbo, whilst the four boss characters were available, they did not have different animations for some punches and kicks. Although this was expected for Balrog (being a boxer), it was unusual to see a character doing a punch when pressing a kick button, or vice-versa.[CR]Aside from the bosses' added moves, some of the main characters' moves were adjusted in some ways. For example, the differences between Ken and Ryu became more defined - Ryu focusing on deadlier fireballs, and Ken's fierce Dragon Punch being able to set opponents on fire.[CR]Criticism[CR]For all the additions and improvements Super Street Fighter II makes over  Street Fighter II: Turbo, its biggest failing is arguably that it does not include the same degree of speed that made Street Fighter II: Turbo such a hit. It is perhaps for this very reason that, in most cases, this game is overlooked in preference to its follow-up -  Super Street Fighter II: Turbo.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Returning charactersSSFII featured four new characters Ryu Ken Masters E.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The player pilots the titular F-15 Strike Eagle, like in the other games in the franchise, but instead of using polygonal 3D graphics like the PC games, the game uses three different perspectives depending on mission and enemies, utilizing the strengths of the SNES hardware in regards of 2D graphics.[CR]When taking off the game starts in a third-person Mode 7 mode, it then switches to an overhead world map, where the plane can be moved between objectives and encounter enemy jets and avoid missiles along the way. When enemy planes are encountered the game switches briefly to a first-person cockpit mode, where enemy planes are depicted as sprites. When the jet arrives at mission-critical targets, it switches to an overhead bombing mode, using Mode 7's scaling and rotation abilities to its fullest.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Tennis, released in 1991 in Japan and North America and on June 1992 in Europe, is a tennis game exclusive to the SNES (games of the same name exist on the MSX and Sega Master System, but are only similar in name and are otherwise completely different). The biggest feature is its Circuit mode, in which players partake in a tennis season with the objective of finishing with the most ranking points and thus as number one in the world. The year consists of four grand slams and four smaller tournaments, and each takes place on one of the three typical surfaces: hard, grass, and clay. The surfaces, like in real life, vary in bounce and speed. The game also includes the option to play exhibition matches, either singles or doubles, as well as twenty different characters of varying stats and strengths. For example, Phil is a strong serve-and-volleyer, but struggles during baseline rallies, while John's speed and consistent groundstrokes make him a fine baseline player.[CR]Players[CR]The following players appear and are selectable in the game:MenThe character select screen.[CR]Matt -- powerful strokes; consistent server[CR]Brian -- strong serve-and-volleyer[CR]Phil -- strong server[CR]John -- powerful strokes; offensive baseliner[CR]Meyer -- defensive baseliner[CR]Rich -- strong volleyer[CR]Hiro -- accurate strokes; strong returner[CR]Steve -- all-rounder[CR]Rob -- strong server[CR]Mark -- "bullet" servesWomen[CR]Amy -- all-rounder[CR]Kim -- strong serve-and-volleyer[CR]Lisa -- powerful strokes; offensive baseliner[CR]Erin -- strong returner[CR]Donna -- strong all-round player, but with weak serves[CR]Debbie -- accurate strokes[CR]Colett -- defensive baseliner[CR]Nancy -- strong server; baseliner[CR]Yuki -- consistent player[CR]Barb -- powerful strokes; offensive baseliner[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Enter the Secret Exhibition Tournament[CR]Enter the following at the password screen:</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Troll Islands is a platformer developed by Millennium Interactive and published by American Softworks Corporation for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It features Troll dolls: wild-haired toys based on mischievous creatures of Danish/Scandinavian folklore that were invented in 1959 and became a recurring fad in the US and Europe in the following decades.[CR]The game borrows a concept from City Connection or Q*Bert as its central gameplay mechanic: in order to complete each stage, the player has to "paint" the landscape by walking over it. Any non-painted area appears as monochrome, and background details get colored in along with the platforms directly in front of them. The player can pick up and throw objects they find to defeat enemies.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Super Turrican is the next generation installment of the famous Turrican Series. Once again it is up to the U.S.S. Freedom Forces to get into their Turrican Assault Suits and drive back the forces of "The Machine".[CR]Similar to it's predecessors, Super Turican features large levels that are crammed with secrets and can be explored freely and in any direction. To get rid of the numerous enemies, Turrican can use three upgradeable shots: A spreadshot, a powerful laser and a rebound that bounces off of walls. Additionally, there is a Freeze-Beam that can be used to temporarily freeze enemies. It is fully rotatable, and therefor also a great help in discovering secret capsules. These capsules contain powerups and can often be used to reach secret areas. Last but not least, Turrican has the ability to transform into an energy wheel (as long as he has enough special energy), which enables him to lay mines and even makes him invincible.</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Turrican 2</title_clean>
				<plot>Super Turrican is back, and once again the USS Freedom Forces have to prevent the evil Machine from harming innocent civilizations. [CR]This requires the player to jump and shoot his way through large levels filled with lots of enemies. To get rid of all the enemies, several different weapons can be used, most of which are already familiar to players from previous installments of the series: a Laser, a Spread-shot, and a(improved) Rebound. There is also the option to go[CR]into "wheel-mode" for a limited time to become invincible, lay mines and shoot rockets. The Flamethrower is new to the series as well as the Rope, which can be used to climb walls, cling to platforms or pick up out-of-reach items. Much like in side-scrolling shooters, you can now pick up homing missiles as secondary weapons. The biggest difference to previous Turrican-games however, is the fact that in Super Turrican 2 almost half of the levels are strictly linear and don't feature any large secret areas that have become somewhat of a trademark of the series.</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Widget</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Widget is a platformer based on the Widget cartoon show, featuring a small purple alien named Widget who is destined to reach the rank of World Watcher among his species. To accomplish this task, Widget must travel through several different planets in order to save Earth and earn World Watcher status.[CR]It is the sequel to the 1990 NES game Widget. Atlus developed and published the game for the US market exclusively.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay in Super Widget is more or less that of a straightforward platformer with collectibles. The main difference in Super Widget is that the player can collect coins that will make him transform.Transformations[CR]Transforming acts as health for Widget. If Widget is in his original form he will die in one hit from his enemies. If he is transformed he will lose his new form instead of dying. Each transformation also enhances Widget in some way, allowing him to shoot projectiles or making him faster.Collectibles[CR]There are several different items for Widget to collect on his journey:There's something familiar about this...."W" Coins: Collect 100 of these for an extra life."L" Coins: Transforms Widget."S" Coins: Turns Widget into Super Widget: A beefed up version of his original form that can shoot a projectile punch instead of a short ranged punchShields: Gives Widget a shield that will absorb one hit from an enemy. Basically the same as the shields from  Sonic."I" Coins: Turns Widget invincible for a short while. When invincible Widget changes color, has a ring of sparkles around him, and is forced to run in either direction with his legs and feet being represented as a circle.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly's Mike Weigand gave Super Widget a 4 out of 10 writing, "...suffers from truly horrible control..." and had little else to say for the game other than concede that it was probably aimed at younger players.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>S.W.A.T Kats is a game based on the short lived cartoon series S.W.A.T Kats: Radical Squadron. The series would only last for 2 seasons but built a sort of cult following afterwards.[CR]The Swat Kats are a trio of mechanics by day, but secretly also a group of superheroes defending their home, MegaKat city, from creatures and evil villians. Swat Kats is essentially a side-scrolling action game. You start off using T-Bone and Razor and guide them through 5 different worlds of action packed excitement. Game levels are based on different episodes of the show. As you progress through the game you can increase your weapon levels and gain new weapons. Mode 7 graphics are featured in some parts of the game. A unique feature to the game is the ability to start on different levels.</plot>

				<title_clean>Syndicate</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Syndicate is a  cyberpunk  isometric  real-time tactical game developed by  Bullfrog Productions and released in 1993 to critical acclaim. An expansion pack,  Syndicate: American Revolt (1993) and a sequel,  Syndicate Wars (1996), have also been released. On February 22, 2012 a  remake was released by  EA Partners and developed by  Starbreeze Studios.[CR]Backstory[CR]As the world of today slipped into the future, multinational corporations grew in size and profit. They came into positions to own small countries and to exercise direct influence over the world's governments. They practically became the world's governments, undemocratically controlling the lives of people through commerce. These corporations became known as Megacorps.[CR]One of the Megacorps, a European one, invented the CHIP. A device that is inserted into the neck and stimulates the brain stem to alter a persons perception of the outside world. The CHIP numbs a person's senses to the misery and squalor around them better than any drug and sold millions around the world. It could convince a user that the sun shone when it was raining and that they were more beautiful than they really were.[CR]The CHIP, like some  drugs, also made the user open to  auto-suggestion, allowing them to be manipulated by the Megacorps. The CHIP became a perfect tool for the Megacorps to manipulating the populace and to gain power with. It didn't take long before the Megacorps were corrupted and became crime Syndicates, fighting amongst each other for monopoly over CHIP manufacturing and control over the world.[CR]And in the year of 2096, the Syndicates have not only upgraded the drug they push, but also the way they fight. Instead of using ordinary thugs, they now use teams of custom-built  cyborg  agents to do their dirty deeds.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player takes on the role of a young executive in a small European Syndicate. The objective of the game is to spread the Syndicate's control globally.World view screen[CR]The world is divided up into 50 territories. To gain control over a territory, the player must complete a mission in that territory. Missions objectives include the assassination of an important person, the elimination of rival agents or kidnapping. Once a territory has been gained, the player can start to collect taxes within it. The taxed amount can be adjusted, but if raised too high, the population can become rebellious against the Syndicate.[CR]The player selects a mission from the World map and can then select and outfit agents with weapons and  cybernetic modifications. Between missions, the player can also research new weapons and modifications. This is necessary if the player is to achieve the ultimate goal of world domination.During a mission[CR]In the missions the player controls up to four agents from a fixed isometric view. This is to reflect the fact that the player's character is sitting in an airship high above the city map. The player tells the CHIP controlled agents where to move and where to fire. They will not react to any event unless the player activates Panic mode. During missions, the player can kill  civilians and destroy many things without consequence.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR] Pistol: Very cheap, but basically worthless. Medium range. Shotgun: Short effective range, but does more damage than the hand gun. Uzi SMG: Fast rate of fire, medium range and comes with plenty of ammunition.Long Range Rifle: Very long range and extremely accurate.Flame Thrower: Devastating, but with a very short range.Mini Gun: Gatling gun with a devastating rate of fire and an incredible range. Laser Gun: Will cut through anyone or anything that gets in it way.Gauss Gun: Portable rocket launcher. Hell yeah.[CR]Special Equipment[CR]Persuadertron: A short range weapon that fires a small dose of chemicals, which will make the target lose all their free will and follow the agent who fired.Access Card: Plastic card that allows some security doors to restricted areas to be opened. Will also identify the agent carrying it as a Police officer to other Police units.Scanner: Scans for possible threats and items in the area.Time Bomb: High powered explosive that will, after a set time period, blow with devastating force.MediKit: Will restore a single agent&#8217;s health completely.Energy Shield: Will, during a very short time span, completely protect the agent against all projectile weapons.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>T2 - The Arcade Game</title_clean>
				<plot>As the title states, this is the home conversion of the arcade rail-shooter based on the film Terminator 2: Judgement Day. Up to two players shoot through future and present levels as robotic killers reprogrammed to serve the human resistance. [CR]Both players wield a machine gun with infinite ammo that lowers its firing rate (overheats) as it is continuously fired. A secondary weapon (missile launchers in the future, shotguns in the present) has limited ammo but deals heavy damage. Powerups inside the game world include secondary weapon ammo and coolant for the machine guns, and are shot to be collected.[CR]T2: The Arcade Game features seven levels based on specific scenes or general concepts in the film. The first four levels act as a prelude, as the player guns down waves of metal Terminators across a post-apocalyptic Battlefield, a besieged Human Hideout, and through the security checkpoints of the enemy supercomputer SkyNet. After destroying the computer, players travel back in time to protect John and Sarah Connor, while also destroying every scrap of SkyNet research at the headquarters of its manufacturer. From there, players must fend off the indestructible T-1000 until the final showdown in the Steel Mill.[CR]Assets from the movie are used when possible, such as voice clips from Arnold Schwarzenegger, and close-up digital stills of Robert Patrick for the final battle against the T-1000. The Genesis and SNES versions also support lightguns (the Menacer and Super Scope, respectively).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]At the title screen, quickly press Left, Up, Right, Up, Left, Left, Left, Right, Down, Down, then enter these codes as stated:</plot>

				<plot>This version of Taz-Mania is different from the side-scrolling versions by Sega, in this version the player controls Taz from a third-person perspective.  The goal of the game is to travel down the road, collecting Kiwi's before the timer runs out, avoiding obstacles along the way.  The Kiwi's will get harder to catch as the game goes on, jumping over Taz and actually outrunning him at times.[CR]Some obstacles Taz faces are trees, telephone poles, tour buses, even pterodactyls who will bring Taz back at the beginning of the level, but also have to avoid characters such as Axl &amp; Bull, a pair of gators who try to capture Taz for the zoo, The She-Devil who is in love with Taz and if the player is caught by her, the game is instantly over and Wendal T. Wolf, who will jump on Taz's back and cover the screen with his hands making it hard to see.[CR]You can avoid some obstacles by using Taz's tornado spin, but using the spin will cause Taz's health meter to drop, but it can be refilled by eating Kiwi's along with blue and red birds, bushrats and items thrown to Taz by Didgeri Dingo, but beware, he can also throw obstacles at Taz as well including T.N.T.  There is also a bonus stages after completing three levels in which you collect as many items you can in the allotted time to raise the score.</plot>

				<plot>The main character Ray and his party of Aqutallion warriors quest to find and destroy Homncruse, the evil power threatening their world. Ray begins his journey alone on a tiny island, but eventually he meets his friends and fellow Aqutallion Warriors, Tina, Cody, Leona, and Dan, and even creates a town for the victims of Homncruse's evil to live. Villains encountered along tend to range from comical, such as Cat Boo and Badbad with his lackeys the Badmen, to the elite generals of evil of Homncruse, Dram, Booth, Gara, and Godem.[CR]Initially all the teens are considered Pennon, the lowest rank of warrior. Before they can destroy Homncruse each of them must undergo a trial at their respective temples hidden around the world to receive the secondary powers of Banalet. Dan is an exception because he is the descendant of the prosperous Wise Man clan of Aqutallion. When Ray, Tina, Cody, and Leona achieve the status of Banalet and are united by the powers of Dan, Aqutallion is reborn and the group gains incredible powers.[CR]The Aqutallions are not alone. 11 members of Kustera can be recruited to fight for the young warriors in their place for a time being. The Kustera are mostly meant to serve as a supplement to the Aqutallions, but their role in the story is vital to its progression. From the same temples where the Aqutallions gain their Banalet status, there is a Kustera only warp icon that sends the group to a dungeon where great treasures are hidden.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]:[CR]The battle system follows the traditional RPG battle system where the party trades blows with opponents in simple turn-based fashion, the player selecting all commands for the following round of combat and then watching the results, such as in the Dragon Quest games. Play switches between two parties throughout the game. Certain areas are inaccessible without the right party.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Optional Kustera members[CR]Several Kusteras are found throughout the game that are not normally obtained through the main story. Here is[CR]how to get them.  [CR]Ben[CR]In Decatas, talk to the woman in the rightmost house  in the group of three. Find Ben in the nearby bar in the main district.[CR]Evelyn [CR]In Elekees, find her in a house near the entrance.[CR]Ryu [CR]After defeating Badbad and using the Dogpill, he  is in a house in Beegees. Talk to him and he will join.[CR]Shark [CR]After getting Dan, find Shark in the house southwest  of Bonzley.[CR]Max money for Kustera[CR]On some game files, you are able to obtain max money for Kustera! First, you must be at Decatas with your Aqutallion party (ideally, right after Morgan gets you into the town). Swap to the Kustera party, and walk to Decatas, but DO NOT FIGHT IN ANY BATTLES. If you encounter an enemy, run away. When you get to Decatas, use Morgan's hole to get inside, then walk inside the building with Uncle Save. Talk to the other person behind the counter, and they will offer to bribe the guards away from the front gate. Ordinarily, this will cost 1000G, but on some occasions, no money will be deducted but the guards will still be gone, and on other occasions, Kustera will be left with 9, 999, 999G! It does not always work, so do not worry if it does not work for you the first time you try it.[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secret_of_the_Stars[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Max money for Kustera[CR]On some game files, you are able to obtain max money for Kustera!

				<title_clean>Tecmo Super Baseball</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tecmo Super Baseball is a 1994 Super Nintendo and Genesis baseball game and part of Tecmo's "Super" series of sports games. The game is licensed by the MLBPA but not the MLB, so it contains the names and likenesses of all the athletes active in the MLB at the time but not the team names. Instead, the game uses generic city names for its teams, as well as featuring two All-Star teams.[CR]The batting/pitching uses the genre's standard camera angle of having the pitcher at the top of the screen with the batter at the bottom, but the game uses an unusual perspective for its fielding, which follows the ball rather than switching to an overhead view. The player automatically switches to the closest fielder in the ball's trajectory, allowing the player to quickly reach it and return it. The camera will continue to follow the ball as it is thrown around.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Tecmo Super Bowl</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tecmo Super Bowl is an enhanced remake of the original 1991 Tecmo Super Bowl for the NES released for the 16-bit Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis consoles in late 1993. It features multiple graphical and mechanical tweaks, and still has the licenses of both the NFL and the NFLPA, allowing both real-life team and player names to be used. A disclaimer during the intro purports that all team rosters are accurate as of August 16, 1993. Among the new changes were variable weather conditions and NFL team logos on the endzones.[CR]Tecmo Super Bowl uses the same perspective as its forebears: a zoomed-out view of the field that allows the player to see a large number of athletes from both teams at once, around which they can plan strategies.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy Defense[CR]When you're on defense, select the nose tackle (the middle man on the defensive line) and hold down-right.  When the ball is snapped, press B as soon as possible and you will shoot across the line and tackle the QB/RB (whomever has the ball).  This doesn't work for every offensive play, but will work the vast majority of the time.</plot>

				<plot>[CR]Provided the most in depth  TECMO football action ever. All 30 NFL teams and their rosters are included in the game, and a new free agency system makes the game like your own personal league. Updated graphics and player photos made this installment of the popular series shine above its previous incarnations. Complete stats, audibles, and tournament-style play spice things up, while the addition of Passing and Superstar modes deliver a needed increase in gameplay to the aging TECMO Super Bowl series. You call all of the plays, changing your defensive formations and offensive lineups to match your opponents' moves. With dive plays, touchbacks, and more, this is a classic football game that installed many of the gameplay elements seen in many of today's football games.The game also featured player injuries. Occasionally, a player would be injured, and would have to sit out a game or two.  However, the game did not have any method of classifying the injuries, or how long they would affect the player.  However, it was still a step towards the more realistic football simulations of the present day.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Special Ending[CR]Beat the Super Bowl 3 times in a row to get the credits and a better ending.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Hall of Fame players unlocked[CR]Win 3 straight Super Bowls with the same team.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters (known in Europe as Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles: Tournament Fighters, and in the Japanese SNES version as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Warriors) are 2D fighting games developed and published by Konami for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Genesis on December 1993, and for the Nintendo Entertainment System (only in North America and Europe) on February 1994.Based on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise, each of the three fighting games pits the titular ninja turtles (Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo) against a variety of mutants, aliens, and martial artists from the series (usually to rescue their kidnapped mentor, Master Splinter).Each of the three games are known for having completely different fighting game engines, storylines, and character rosters. Each game also have their own unique gameplay mechanic: the SNES version has a Super Meter for powerful super moves, the Genesis version has super moves available at low vitality, and the NES version has a special "ball" power-up for a bonus special move.Tournament Fighters is the last in the franchise to be released in the 1990s (creating a ten-year hiatus ending with the tie-in game to the 2003 animated series). The NES version is also known both as Konami's last game released for that platform and as one of the few fighting games released for that platform.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Each of the three games have different assortments of playable characters with minor overlap. All playable characters (with the exception of Aska and Sisyphus) have appeared in previous comics and the animated series. The only characters that are playable in all three games are the ninja turtles themselves:Leonardo - The leader of the turtles and has a serious personality. Known by his blue headband and dual katanas.Donatello - The brains of the turtles who is often working on his inventions. Known by his purple headband and bo staff.Raphael - The surly wiseguy of the group. Known by his red headband and dual sais.Michelangelo - The easy-going "party dude". Known by his orange headband and dual nunchaku.SNES VersionShredder - The leader of the Foot Clan and the turtles' eternal nemesis: a ninja warrior adorned with spiked armor. Known in the game as "Cyber Shredder".War - A fierce monster with large claws. Referred to in-game as an "intergalactic lifeform".Aska - A ninja girl hoping to open her own dojo with her prize winnings. She is an original character exclusive to this game.Wingnut - A mutant resembling a bat.Chrome Dome - An android that Shredder once built to exterminate the turtles.Armaggon - A mutant, resembling a shark, from the future.Rat King - A crimelord who has a legion of rats at his beck and call. (boss, unlockable in Versus mode with a cheat code)Karai - A high-ranking member of the Foot Clan and a powerful martial artist. (boss, unlockable in Versus mode with a cheat code)Genesis VersionCasey Jones - A street vigilante who fights with improvised weapons.Ray Fillet - A mutant resembling a manta ray.April O'Neil - A news reporter (and usual damsel in distress for the turtles) who now takes part in combat.Sisyphus - A mutant resembling a scarab beetle. It is an original character exclusive to this game.Triceraton - Member of an alien species resembling a anthropomorphic triceratops (boss, only playable with an external cheat tool)Krang's Android - A disembodied alien brain and Shredder's oft-cohort (boss, only playable with an external cheat tool)Karai - (boss, only playable with an external cheat tool)NES VersionCasey JonesHothead - A Chinese-American firefighter who was magically transformed into a dragon.Shredder[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]NES VersionThe turtles have been challenged by Shredder, but before they fight him they decide to have a tournament between themselves to see who is ready for the encounter.SNES VersionA tournament has been organized and fighters from all over have entered, Shredder of course being one of them. The turtles decide to enter the tournament in order to stop Shredder and prove their strength in battle.One of the unique features of the SNES version was the different turbo speeds. At the highest setting, this game was faster than Street Fighter II Turbo at the highest setting.Genesis Version Master Splinter is kidnapped by four purple turtles. When the real turtles find out, Krang appears and tells the turtles that he has Splinter with him and that the only way to rescue him is to go to Dimension X and meet Krang. [CR][B]Endings:[/B][CR]The endings on the NES version are basically the same for all four of the turtles. The only difference is the portrait of the turtle which the player used to beat the game. In the ending the winning turtle accuses Shredder of being up to one of his lousy tricks. Shredder says that they have not seen the last of him, he then gets up and runs off-screen. Splinter comes floating into the screen, drops down in front of the turtle and says "You have performed well my sons. Now let us celebrate our victory."Endings (SNES)CharacterEnding RaphaelRaphael gives his thanks to Splinter and April by giving them a pile of gifts. Raphael then tells them he is happy to have friends as good as they are. MichelangeloMichelangelo decides to take a vacation in the Bahamas to do some surfing, then invites the other turtles to come along. LeonardoLeonardo says his daily training has paid off, and now he must set new goals and set out to achieve those goals. Leonardo then goes right back into his training. DonatelloDonatello goes back to working on his latest invention which then blows up. He then says he might have some money left over to start a new invention. AskaAska is happy to be able to finally realize her dream of teaching younger people in the ways of Ninjitsu. She then exclaims she will have the best dojo in the entire world. ShredderShredder says he knew he would win the tournament and that he has defeated the turtles for the last time. He now has his sights set on conquering Earth. WarWar exclaims that he won and that has shown the other fighters not to mess with an intergalactic life form. ArmaggonArmaggon exclaims that it is only natural that he won the tournament and that he is the strongest living being on the planet and must now conquer it. WingnutWingnut only entered the tournament to pound some heads. He pounded everyone else and ended up winning and now will be able to waste even more money. Chrome DomeChrome Dome now has the money to purchase the necessary computers in order to extract his faulty program. He will finally be able to exist in peace. [CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the SNES version review scores of 9,8,9 and 9 out of ten. Ed Semrad wrote, "This has got to be one of the best fighting games next to Street Fighter 2, (and in some cases better than SF2). The voices are crisp and clear, plus the control is absolutely wonderful! Another factor that I truly like is the story mode set up with dialog boxes unraveling the whole plot! There are plenty of combos that will get you going! Another great hit from the pros at Konami".[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV - Turtles in Time</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]TMNT : Turtles in Time Arcade Machine[CR]Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time is a side-scrolling beat-em-up similar to Double Dragon. The Super Nintendo version of the game changes perspective during one level in which the SNES' Mode 7 graphics capabilities are used to give the appearance that the player is traveling forwards on a z-axis plane; although movement is still basically restricted to left and right.[CR]All four turtles are playable characters: Michelangelo, Leonardo, Donatello and Raphael. The game pans out in a linear fashion and each stage involves lots of battles with Foot Soldiers and other enemies. A boss is usually at the end of each level.[CR]Fans of Turtles in Time praise a variety of moves that are easy to master while remaining fresh. These moves include slide tackles, grabs that send enemies rocketing towards the foreground and off the map and other useful attacks. Furthermore, the four-player co-op (two-player on SNES) serves as a natural fit for the four turtles. Super Nintendo owners are likely to include TMNT IV in a list of the best games of all-time on the console.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The game begins as Krang, in a massive exosuit, swoops in and steals the Statue of Liberty during April O'Neil's newscast. Just as this happens, the Turtles' arch-enemy Shredder hijacks the broadcast in order to laugh at and taunt our heroes, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The city is in a dire situation, and the turtles rush to the rescue. The turtles pursue the foot clan through New York City and through the sewers, until the Shredder sends them all through a time warp. Through both past and future time periods, the heroes must fight Shredder's henchmen to save history.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Turtle combat![CR]In the Arcade version, up to four players can play simultaneous as each of the turtles, while in the SNES version, only two players can play cooperatively. Each character has a different playing style to go along with their differing weapons. Donatello is the slow yet ranged character, Michelangelo and Raphael are the fast short ranged characters, and Leonardo is the all-around character. Similar to previous TMNT games on the NES, each turtle is equipped with their own special attack. If a player stuns an enemy by hitting them enough, special actions can result. These special actions include using the enemy as a weapon against other enemies, and throwing the enemy towards the screen.[CR]As with many other beat-em-up style games, Turtles in Time has a relatively simple control scheme. The player controls their turtle of choice using the arcade joystick (or the SNES D-pad) and has two buttons which command the turtle to jump and attack. Players can hold the joystick in a direction to make their character run. Players can also attack while jumping, and have different attacks that happen when the player attacks during a run. There are two air attacks, a basic slash, and a forward moving attack. Using other combinations, players can mix up their tactics, and finally, perform special attacks.Players can throw people at the screen.[CR]In addition to the main story sequence, the SNES version of Turtles in Time offers versus and time trial modes. In the versus mode, players select the turtle of choice, and go head to head in arena combat. The versus mode plays out as the regular game, but rather then battling opponents, players battle each other. The stage is limited, and the controls remain unchanged. In the time trial mode, players can select from a menu the stage of their choice. They then will play through the selected level, and be timed while doing it. Players can run through each level multiple times, trying to beat their own scores, or those of friends, family, and lovers.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]Sewer Surfin'!Big Apple, 3 A.M. - The first level, takes place in New York City at a high-rise construction site. Players fight Baxter on this level.Alleycat Blues - Takes place on the streets of New York. Metal Head is the boss of this level.Sewer Surfin' - A level that takes involves surfing in the sewer, where players fight the Rat King.Technodrome: Let's Kick Shell! - (SNES version only) The turtles enter the Technodrome and take on Tokka and Rahzar, before taking on Shredder in a battletank.Prehistoric Turtlesaurus - A level that takes place far in the past, in the age of dinosaurs. Players will engage Cement Man (Slash in SNES version) at the end of this level.Skull and Crossbones - This level takes place on a pirate ship, and pits players against Tokka and Rahzar (Bebop and Rocksteady in SNES version).Bury my Shell at Wounded Knee - The final level in the past, which takes place on a train. The boss of this level is Leather Head.Neon Night-Riders - The first level that takes place in the future, this level takes place on a highway in 2020 and is the second 'surfing' level. Super Krang awaits the turtles at the end of this level.Where No Turtles Have Gone Before - The final level in the future, set in a space colony in 2100. Krang appears in a space ship to fight the turtles.Technodrome: The Final Shell Shock - The turtles take on Shredder's final form, known as Super Shredder. This level is a boss fight only.[CR]Differences Between Arcade and SNES Versions[CR]Let's Kick Shell![CR]Due to the weaker hardware of the SNES, the graphics had to be toned down for the port. Character animations are essentially the same in both versions of the game. The major visual difference comes in the game's backgrounds, which are noticeably more detailed in the arcade version. Boss fights in the SNES version were also less detailed, with each boss exploding upon defeat, whereas in the Arcade version they would each do something different. Actual bosses were replaced, added or moved in the game as well. The SNES version adds Rat King, an initial encounter with Shredder before opening the time warp, Slash, the tandem of Bebop and Rocksteady. Cement Man was removed from Prehistoric Turtlesaurus and Tokka and Rahzar were shuffled to a sub-boss position in the first Technodrome level. Each game also had different light and weather effects in the arcade version. The arcade version of 'Skull and Crossbones' has rain, but it is all clear skies in the SNES game.[CR]While the arcade version was graphically superior in most cases, SNES Mode 7 allowed for other graphical enhancements. The arcade version of 'Neon Night-Riders' was simply another surfing level, the SNES version utilized Mode-7 to give it a unique behind the back viewpoint. Players could also choose the appearance of the turtles, making them look like the cartoon or the comic versions of the characters. Neon Night-Riders, along with Sewer Surfin', were altered to become bonus levels in the SNES version.[CR]While the soundtracks are nearly identical, one song was replaced in the SNES version. The SNES game also lacked the bosses' voices which were heard in the arcade, as well as any turtle voices. Due to the switch from voice to text, the SNES version also contained some typos.T-U-R-T-L-E Power![CR]For the SNES port, Konami tightened the gameplay mechanics. Combos were streamlined, and throw moves were changed to allow the player to intentionally perform a certain throw move. The game was also balanced, with character attacks chaining, and making the turtles' special attacks take away some of their health when performed. Character distinction was boosted, giving them all more distinctive attack and movement speed, and different traits to their special attacks.[CR]There were also a number of changes to enemies' AI in the SNES version. Many Foot soldier attacks were changed and/or removed, making their array of moves much less varied. The Foot soldiers also used their more effective moves, such as the grab, less frequently compared to the Arcade version.[CR]Re-Shelled, Bro![CR]Turtles in Time Re-Shelled[CR]A Turtles in Time arcade remake was released on August 5, 2009 on the Xbox Live Marketplace. The game is remade in 3D graphics, but still retains the classic beat-em up gameplay of the original. The official title of this game is "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time Re-Shelled." It was available for 800 Microsoft points ($10). It was also released for the PS3 on September 12, 2009 as a downloadable title through the PSN for $9.99.[CR]As of July 1, 2011, the title is no longer available on XBLM or PSN in the US due to an expired license.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Terminator 2: Judgment Day was released in 1991 as an Arcade game and later ported to many home consoles, the game had the player(s) shoot their way through Skynet's arsenal of robot armies and advanced weaponry as an on-rails first-person shooter. The Arcade cabinet included a firearm controller, though home versions would not include a gun controller.[CR]The home versions were released as T2: The Arcade Game (sometimes Terminator 2: The Arcade Game). This version was released on the Amiga, SNES, Game Boy, Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear, each with varying levels of graphical fidelity to the original Arcade game but all of which largely play the same.[CR]Neither the Arcade game nor its home ports are to be confused with the side-scroller action game Terminator 2: Judgment Day, which had separate developer teams and played entirely differently.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Two of the most popular puzzle games return, but now together in an exclusive compilation for SNES. The games have a slight graphical update when compared with the original Game Boy and NES games, but the gameplay remains totally faithful to the games released for both platforms.[CR]In Tetris, the main objective is to pile blocks that will fall down continuously, in order to create a row or "line" without spaces. For this collection, the game comes with two bonus options: 2 PLAYER GAME (absent in the NES version) and VS. COM (absent in both versions), with 3 CPU opponents available, each one representing a difficulty level (EASY, MEDIUM, and HARD, respectively).[CR]In Dr. Mario, the objective is to eliminate all the viruses contained in a big bottle. Dr. Mario (situated in the upper-right side of the screen) will throw capsules with 6 different color combinations (Red-Red, Red-Blue, Yellow-Yellow, Red-Yellow, Blue-Blue and Blue-Yellow) in order to line up at least four viruses or capsules of the same color horizontally or vertically and to make them disappear. In this compilation, the game comes with a bonus option: VS. COM, where you'll face the CPU players: Blue Virus (EASY), Yellow Virus (MEDIUM), and Red Virus (HARD).[CR]For competitive players in both games, there is Mixed Match, where you and a friend can play Tetris and Dr. Mario like a tournament! Adjust the handicap levels, play time, music, and other settings to balance your different skills. The game order is: TETRIS B-TYPE (clear a certain amount of lines), DR. MARIO (disinfect a predetermined number of viruses) and TETRIS A-TYPE (clear lines until the time expires). At the end of the time limit, the player with the highest score is the winner.</plot>

				<title_clean>Tetris 2</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tetris 2 is a multi-platform puzzle game sequel from TOSE and published by Nintendo in most territories. It replaces the standard "fill a line with bricks" goal with the new "connect three like colored blocks" goal, with the primary goal of removing all the marked bricks from the field. In this regard it plays very similarly to Dr. Mario. Most modes of Tetris 2 focus on destroying colored crystals with other like colored blocks to clear the board and advance to the next level. It also introduces new tetrominos that are comprised of non-connected pieces, which adds to their versatility.[CR]Tetris 2 was released on the NES, Game Boy and Super Nintendo. It is not to be confused with the earlier Tetris 2 + Bombliss, also developed by TOSE.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]Single Player[CR]Single player modes in Tetris 2 consist of "Normal" and "Puzzle".[CR]Normal Mode[CR]In Normal mode, the screen is filled with a number of colored gems (how many depends on the level). The player's goal is to either destroy all of the colored gems one by one, or, to destroy one of the flashing colored gems. When a flashing colored gem is destroyed, all gems of that color are destroyed. When all colored gems are destroyed, the level is advanced, and more gems are added to the total.[CR]At the start of the game players can choose their speed, one of four songs, and their starting level, up to 30.[CR]Puzzle Mode[CR]In Puzzle mode, the player is given a specific block layout, and specific pieces to begin with. The goal is to find a way to destroy all colored gems with the given pieces. When all colored gems are destroyed, the player advances to the next level, with a new block layout, and new pieces to be used. Every five levels, and cartoon will be unlocked featuring the family seen throughout various parts of the game.[CR]At the start of the game, players can choose whether they way to manually drop the next pieces or if they want the pieces to drop automatically, one of four songs, and their starting level, again, up to 30.[CR]In total there are 100 levels, and a password save feature is included in the game.Multiplayer[CR]Tetris 2's multiplayer has the option to play against a human opponent, or a computer controlled opponent. Regardless of which is chosen, the multiplayer game is the same.[CR]Players begin by choosing their individual speed, level, and one of four songs (when playing the CPU, the speed and level selections will always be the same). In multiplayer, a players level will determine how many colored gems they will have in their playing field; a higher level means more gems.[CR]Unlike in Normal mode, destroying a flashing gem in multiplayer will steal some water from the opponents fish tank, effectively lowering their ceiling, and restoring some height to the player's own if it has been lowered.[CR]A player wins a round by either being the first to destroy all of their colored gems, or by having their opponent go outside their water level (above their ceiling). For winning, a player will receive a fish that swims around in their tank. Multiplayer matches last until a player has won three rounds.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Tetris Attack</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tetris Attack is the North American version of Panel de PonTetris Attack is the North American version of Panel de Pon (Paneru de Pon), initially a Japanese game which was one of the founders of the now commonly found "tile swapping" mechanic of puzzle gameplay. The core gameplay consists of a well partially filled with either 5 or 6 distinct types of tiles, depending on the difficulty level. Adjacent tiles may be swapped horizontally with the cursor, and matching three or more tiles vertically or horizontally will result in the tiles clearing after a short delay animation, during which they become immovable. Additional points may be earned with either "combos," which involve clearing more than 3 tiles simultaneously, or "chains," which require that the tiles above a clearing set fall into another clear. During play, the stack of tiles will slowly rise to the top of the screen, though clearing tiles will pause this advance. After a grace period after the stack reaches the top of the well, the game will end.The version of Panel de Pon included in the Japan-only Nintendo Puzzle Collection has more differences from the original game than any other game included on the disc. The game is essentially the same as Pok&#233;mon Puzzle League, as it is a version of the game skinned as "Panel de Pon 64." Thus, it features many of the same things as Pok&#233;mon Puzzle League (such as a 3D mode, new characters, updated graphics, and a new four-player mode, which wasn't in Pok&#233;mon Puzzle League). Despite these changes, gameplay-wise it is nothing more than an enhanced version of Panel de Pon.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]There are 5 major game modes in Tetris Attack. In most modes, a difficulty level may be selected, and in some modes an initial speed may be selected; this may be confusing to new players, but while the difficulty level affects the rate at which death occurs, the number of tile types in play, and the rate at which tiles fall upon finding themselves in mid-air, the initial speed merely controls the speed at which the stack rises.EndlessThis mode allows the player to select a difficulty level and speed, and allows nearly limitless play. The name of the mode is misleading, however, as gameplay will necessarily end: either the player will die, or reach 99,999 points, upon which the game will end. Should the player reach this maximum point score, credits will be rolled.Time TrialThis mode provides a 2 minute length of time in which to earn as many points as possible. The difficulty and speed may be set prior to the game. This mode may be played with either 1 or 2 players.Stage ClearThe Stage Clear mode requires that players clear the stack down to a particular "clear line" to pass each stage, of which there are several per character in the game. In addition, there are certain "boss battles," in which the player must earn points as quickly as possible to reduce the boss's HP level to zero.PuzzleThis mode involves a collection of designed puzzles, of which there are ten per character in the game, as well as many "special" levels, totaling 120 levels. Each involves a set of tiles that must be cleared completely within the predetermined number of tile swaps.VSA screenshot of gameplayThe VS mode is the only game mode to feature the Garbage mechanic, as well as the only mode which features a computer-controlled AI. In it, each player attempts to stay alive and force the other player to lose first. This may be done by dumping "garbage blocks" upon the other player, by creating either combos or chains. Increasingly large combos will result in larger-width as well as multiple single slabs of garbage to be dropped on the player's opponent, while increasingly large chains will result in thicker single blocks of garbage. Clearing garbage may be done by matching three or more tiles adjacent to the garbage, upon which all the garbage in contact in the stack will flash and begin transforming into normal tiles, starting from the very bottom and progressing to the top of the garbage stack. These tiles, though revealed, are not in play until the entire stack has transformed, upon which it will fall onto the existing stack; this lag time is in turn an excellent time to anticipate and create large combos and chains. However, garbage created with chains consists of single multilayer blocks; these blocks will not completely transform with each attempt - instead, only the bottom layer will become normal tiles, while the rest will transform back into a single block.In addition, there are special tiles in the VS mode which are gray and marked with exclamation points. These appear only sporadically, and, when matched, create special "steel" garbage blocks to be dropped on the player's opponent. These are unique because they do not clear when in contact with regular clearing garbage - they must be cleared separately. This effectively limits the clearing ability of one's opponent, and is particularly useful when sandwiched between two large segments of regular garbage.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]YoshiBumptyFlutterGargantua BlarggLunge FishPrince FroggyLakituPoochyHookbill the KoopaNaval PiranhaKamekBowser[CR][B]Scoring:[/B][CR]As mentioned above, tiles may be cleared in either "combos" or "chains" for additional points.CombosCombos are achieved by clearing more than three tiles simultaneously. This can be done either through clever tile manipulation, or by matching tiles to inactive rows as they appear on screen. A more advanced method, called "garbage chaining," involves matching tiles in play with clearing rows of garbage from above. This is particularly useful for dealing with single blocks of thick garbage.The scoring details of combos are as follows:4 tiles: 20 points5 tiles: 30 points6 tiles: 50 points7 tiles: 60 points8 tiles: 70 points9 tiles: 80 points10 tiles: 100 points11 tiles: 140 points12 tiles: 170 pointsChainsChains are much more difficult to plan and execute than combos, and are thus worth substantially more points. Tiles must fall from above a clear into another clear to create a chain; once this condition is failed, the chain ends and a new one must be initiated. There are several advanced techniques involving chains, many of which are detailed in Advanced Gameplay Mechanics below. Noteworthy, however, is the fact that Tetris Attack does not in fact recognize chains of longer than 13 - rather than the standard x14 or x15 icon which would be the expected result of further chaining, players are presented with a x? icon and rewarded no points whatsoever for their continued efforts.Another nuance in the scoring system involving chains, however, is that of "bonuses." When a normal clear is made alongside a chain, that clear is awarded the same number of points as the current chain clear, instead of the standard clear amount. Thus, a standard strategy when trying to score points quickly is to quickly build out to a x13 chain, then instantly initiating as many standard three tile clears on the side as possible to maximize the number of points earned on the chain.The scoring details of chains are as follows:x2 chain: 50 pointsx3 chain: 80 pointsx4 chain: 150 pointsx5 chain: 300 pointsx6 chain: 400 pointsx7 chain: 500 pointsx8 chain: 700 pointsx9 chain: 900 pointsx10 chain: 1100 pointsx11 chain: 1300 pointsx12 chain: 1500 pointsx13 chain: 1800 pointsx14 chain: 0 points[CR]Advanced Gameplay Mechanics[CR]Several nuances in Tetris Attack's engine allow for unique techniques while playing Tetris Attack. Since most rules are calculated on a frame-by-frame basis, some of the basic physical rules of the game can be bent - others may be broken. For instance, it is possible for a single tile to very briefly, while in the process of shifting between two columns, support two sets of falling tiles above it, just long enough to register the above tiles as a clear should they be positioned as such. This is particularly useful as a last-resort when attempted to keep chains alive. It is also possible, though vastly more difficult, to swap tiles in midair as they fall, and to swap tiles "through" clear arrangements such as they do not trigger the clear.[CR]Story and Multiple Endings[CR]Choosing one of the friends to free.Tetris Attack's story is rather loose: there appears to be some sort of curse which has befallen all the major characters (who were enemies from Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, but are apparently now friends) except for Yoshi, and Yoshi must therefore battle each character in a VS mode match to free them. Upon freeing Lakitu, Bumpty, Poochy, Flying Wiggler, Froggy, Blargg, Lunge Fish, and Rafael the Raven, the gang continues on to defeat Hookbill the Koopa, Naval Piranha, Kamek, and finally Bowser (in difficulty levels above easy) in the Cave of Darkness to win the day. Upon completion on hard, a code is given to the player to unlock "hardest" mode, and upon completion of hardest mode without dying, another code is given which allows the selection of characters prior to each match rather than only matches in the Cave of Darkness; the point is to choose characters other than Yoshi, as hinted at in the dialogue. Each level of completion involves a different set of dialogue at the end. However, this final step to achieving the VS mode "perfect" ending is rather superfluous, as it is no more difficult than beating the game on hardest without dying without the character selection.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] 1-P vs. Mode Passwords[CR]Go to 'vs' in the menu selection, then go to the 'password' menu.

You should hear a confirmation code when you input the cheat correctly. This will remove the "freeze" that occurs when you or your opponent makes a combo or a chain. In other words, the blocks never stop rising. After entering the cheat, activate turbo for either A or B. Once you are competing against your CPU opponent in splitscreen, place your cursor over any two blocks or one block and an empty panel, and hold down turbo. The panels will switch back and forth so quickly that your blocks will not rise, nor will garbage blocks fall on you! Eventually, the speed of the rising blocks will surpass the CPU's ability to get rid of them and you will win!

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends is an educational rail sim featuring the eponymous anthropomorphic train engine. The player must help Thomas the Tank Engine complete various tasks such as taking children to the seaside, bringing medicine to the hospital and delivering the mail. Dead ends, level crossings, other trains and vehicles create obstacles to overcome.[CR]The game was released on the Sega Genesis and the Super Nintendo. An NES port of the SNES game was planned, but cancelled late into development.[CR]Sega Genesis version[CR]The Sega Genesis release of Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends is different from the rest. This game puts the player in the role of the engineer, and the player may choose an engine. After the player selects one, a Mario Paint-based game shows up, and the player can color the engine and the engineer, but the only one that will have a direct effect on graphics in the game is the engineer. There is no difference with the engines; all have the same statistics.[CR]There are three modes to use: Race, Game, and Explore. Race puts the player in a competition against another engine. The player must collect sweets and balloons, but avoid mud, red balloons, and engines. After the player wins enough games, Sir Topham Hatt (a.k.a. The Fat Controller) gives the player a medal.[CR]The mode "Game" features Sir Topham Hatt giving instructions to the player. He asks for cars to be brought to a certain station in a certain order, but they must get there quickly. If the job takes too long, Sir Topham Hatt will scold the player. If the assigned job is done speedily, Sir Topham Hatt will praise the player. Eventually, the player will earn a medal.[CR]The mode "Explore" simply is letting the player look around the entire map of Sodor. The mode is just like the other two, only there are no jobs.[CR]Unlike all the other releases, this game does not have The Railway Series stories.[CR]Unreleased NES Game[CR]In 2008, many unreleased NES prototypes were found, and one of them was a NES version of the SNES game Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends. The game is identical to the SNES game, but with no voice acting and lower quality graphics.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Thunder Spirits is a 1991 SNES port of the arcade title Thunder Force AC, which itself was a modified port of the highly-praised Sega Genesis title Thunder Force III developed by Technosoft. The port was published by Seika Corporation.[CR]When compared with the Genesis title, gameplay-wise they were nearly identical, with the only real differences being the Heads Up Display being moved from the top to the bottom of the screen, minor alterations to some of the levels, and the removal of the ability to choose the order in which you completed the levels. However, it suffered from the notorious "slowdown" that plagued many early Super Nintendo titles when too much activity on the screen at once would overtax the system. A loss in music and sound effects quality was present as well.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]Enter the code while the game is paused.

				<title_clean>Time Slip</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Time Slip is a 1993 Super Nintendo Entertainment System game developed by Sales Curve and published by Vic Tokai. The game is very similar to the Contra franchise (more specifically, Contra III: The Alien Wars), but was criticized for being of exceptionally lower quality. The game was criticized for its poor artificial intelligence, sloppy control, no continues, and general lack of challenge. Reviewers agreed that the game's music was its best aspect. Time Slip holds a 36% average on Game Rankings.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Dr. Vincent Gilgamesh gets in the time machine.[CR]Time Slip stars Dr. Vincent Gilgamesh, a scientist from the year 2045 who discovers an alien plot to take over Earth. To prevent an invasion of an alien race called the Tiamatians, Dr. Gilgamesh travels to various eras of time to defeat the aliens (as they have found a way to exploit rifts in time).[CR]The background of the Tiamatians is simple; they are from the planet Tiamat. The aliens want to find a planet similar to Tiamat, so they send a probe through the rift called the Torquemada II. Through use of that probe, they find Earth, and intend to turn it into Tiamat II. By then, scientists on Earth have discovered the rift as well, and have been studying it for years.[CR]If the player gets a game over during gameplay, Dr. Gilgamesh fails to prevent the aliens from conquering Earth, and it is hinted that his birth is even prevented.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Time Slip was criticized for being far too easy.[CR]The game is very similar to Contra III: The Alien Wars. Even movements mirror those of Contra III. Time Slip does have its numerous differences, however. One such differences is the TGS bar (essentially a power bar, that must constantly be refilled). This TGS bar is what keeps Dr. Gilgamesh alive, and if it runs out he dies. To refill the bar, players must be picking up crystals scattered throughout the levels.[CR]Every level is filled with various enemies, a mid-level boss, and a level boss. The game was notoriously easy, even with its later bosses. Scattered throughout the levels are traps based on the time period Dr. Gilgamesh is in. Similarly to Contra III, the player can upgrade weapons as gameplay progresses. By picking up power-ups (found in boxes that must be "shot" open), the player can improve the weapon (although these upgrades are lost after death). Time Slip even contains some vehicles for the player to use, although they do not dramatically alter gameplay.[CR]Time Slip, unlike Contra III, has no continues, and rather starts the player out with nine lives. In addition, there is no code to expand the player's lives (Contra III contains the famous Konami Code). Time Slip has no way to save the game either, and no password system, so if the player dies, they have to start completely over.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Time Trax</title_clean>
				<plot>Time Trax is based off of the 1993-94 sci-fi action series starring Dale Midkiff; you take the role of Darien Lambert, captain of the Fugitive Retrieval Section of Washington D.C. It is the year 2193 and your once high arrest record has started to decline sharply as routine trackdowns end in mysterious disappearances. It is discovered that noted MIT scientist Dr. Mordecai 'Mo' Sahmbi has been sending criminals back in time to 1993 using his invention the TRAX time machine, and has gone back himself. TRAX is captured by the police, and three guesses as to who is tasked with capturing the criminals and sending them back to 2193.[CR]As Lambert, your primary targets in this game are neo-Nazi racist Sepp Dietrich and Sahmbi himself. You do have some equipment to help you: your supercomputer S.E.L.M.A. (Specified Encapsulated Limitless Memory Archive), disguised as an AT&amp;T Mastercard and whose holographic persona resembles a British nanny, and the PPT (Pellet Projection Tube), a weapon capable of stunning a human from periods of a couple of minutes to a few hours and can fire pellets that render humans transportable to the future, disguised a keyless car alarm remote. Also, you have the ability to "time stall" (this slows the speed of images reaching your brain, allowing you to react quickly) and your Mosh-Ti (an Occidental improvement of martial arts) skills to rely on if the situation gets dire.[CR]You'll run through the alleys of the future, through the Smithsonian (circa 1993), ride a motorcycle and jet-ski, battle criminals atop a construction site, and do so much more until you've finally captured the two fugitives.</plot>

				<title_clean>Timecop</title_clean>
				<plot>Based off of the Jean Claude Van Damme film Timecop, this game acts as a sequel of sorts. We learned well from the film that the power time travel affords corrupts all men weaker than the Muscles from Brussels, and this has extended to the original inventor of time travel. He proclaims himself dictator of the universe, captures Van Damme as he arrives from fixing all the wrongs in the film, and challenges him to a "duel across time." Platforming action follows across multiple periods of history.[CR]The primary feature of this game is its digitized characters, uncommon for console games of that era. Actors were taped in front of a bluescreen and stills were taken from the video to create all characters and their animations. The effect is impressive for the SNES, though it does result in robotic enemies who do not respond well to being punched or kicked. The "timing,", both in terms of controlling your character and fighting with enemy characters seems off through the entire game.[CR]There are 15 levels in total, most of which are standard fighting platform levels. Three basic fighting moves are available to the character, not including jumping and crouching kicks, and not including the use of a gun with extremely limited ammo. Some vehicle levels are mixed in, and the game culminates in a jetpack duel over Los Angeles with the villainous time travel creator fellow.[CR]The game also featured some rare use of digital voice, primarily in the "FBI... Get on it!" background theme in the first few levels.</plot>

The object in this game is to have fun while Timon and Pumbaa from The Lion King entertain the player with glimpses of jungle living, especially when certain mini-games require the player to consume insects. The PC version featured a full voiceover, complete with humorous introductions to games. The SNES version does not feature the voiceover, but has some sound effects from the PC version intact.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tin Star is a Western-style on-rails shooting game with robots exclusive to the Super Nintendo in the US. It was developed by UK studio Software Creations and published by Nintendo themselves.[CR]The main character of the game is a sheriff named  Tin Star sent to East Driftwood to clean up the town. Tagging a long is his trusty sidekick Mo Crash and his horse Aluminum. Tin Star goes to the town of East Driftwood to stop Black Bart, the leader of the Bad Oil Gang.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] And keep 'em up.[CR]Acts are replaced with days and in days there are levels called scenes. The game starts on Monday, and goes through until Sunday. At the start of every day is a shooting gallery  mini-game. The training consists of trying to keep one or more jugs in the air for as long as possible by shooting the jugs. Every time a jug gets shot, the more more money the player receives. The jugs also change color if they are in the air long enough. If the player waits, the game will change and the player will instead try to juggle the bottles while shooting a target to gain money.[CR] The game play is an  on-rails shooter that is either in first person view or in a 2D mode where the player can see Tin Star, but cannot control him. In this mode Tin Star moves independently, and aims his gun wherever the player is pointing the crosshairs. Tin Star not only has to take down enemy robots, but remove hazards like birds, dynamite and other objects. At the end of certain levels there are mini-bosses, which often appear more than once in the game. One of the boss showdowns.[CR]At the end of the day after several stages, there is a main boss fight which is a one-on-one showdown in the street. This fight consists of the player shooting a cylinder from a revolver from one of the four corners of the screen and then shooting the boss in the middle of the screen.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Changing Tin Stars color[CR]At the title screen, when you start a new game, press A, B, X, or Y to change Tin Star's color. [CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Secret Bonus[CR]To earn a chance at the Secret Bonus in a level, simply beat the level without shooting a single health canteen.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]TNN Bass Tournament of Champions is a fishing game developed by both Gaps (SNES version) and Imagitec Design (Genesis version). The game was published in the US (both platforms) by American Softworks Corporation while the Japanese Super Famicom version was published by King Records.[CR]The US version is endorsed by TNN, a.k.a. the The Nashville Network. The TV network, renamed to Spike after 2000, was well known for hosting fishing shows. The Japanese SFC version, where the TNN license wouldn't translate, is instead endorsed specifically by Larry Nixon, a professional angler. The Nippon Bass Club also shares an endorsement credit.[CR]Platform Differences[CR]The SNES and Genesis versions of the game were developed by different developers despite using the same name. While the two versions of the game have the same branding and same basic premise, they play slightly different and look quite different.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In Winter Extreme, the player can partake in a series of skiing and snowboarding events including the Downhill where the player speeds down a course in order to finish the course as fast as possible in an allotted time by speeding through checkpoints.  The Slalom has the same set-up where the player has to finish the course in an allotted time by passing through gates, but also has to contend with twists, turns and various other obstacles in the players path.  The Giant Slalom is similar except for more obstacles and a longer path.[CR]Along with the three challenge modes, there is also a Freeride mode where the player can ski at their leisure while avoiding various obstacles such as trees, rocks and fellow skiers and snowboarders.  The game also is endorsed by skiing location, Val-d'Isre, which hosted the 1992 Winter Olympics along with skier, Tommy Moe.</plot>

				<title_clean>Tony Meola's Sidekicks Soccer</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tony Meola's Sidekicks Soccer is a soccer game exclusively for the Super Nintendo. The game features many international and national teams from across the globe, and uses the Super Nintendo's distinctive Mode 7 graphics to depict the field from the soccer player's perspective, turning the camera whenever possession of the ball switches teams.[CR]The game was named for and licensed by Tony Meola, the national US team's goalkeeper at the time. It is known as Ramos Ruy no World Wide Soccer in Japan, after the Brazilian-born soccer player Ruy Ramos who had just recently become a naturalized Japanese citizen and played for their national team in the 1994 World Cup. In Brazil and other South American countries, the game is known as Super Copa, after the Copa Am&#233;rica football association of South America.[CR]Despite being a soccer game released in various territories, it remains one of the few to never see a European release.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the scores of 6,5,5,4 and 6 out of ten. Mike Weigand, who gave a score of six wrote, "This game adds a new and different perspective to the usual home video soccer game, but the game play can get very confusing at times. Yet, there are plenty of options to interest veteran video game sports fans".[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Top Gear</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Top Gear is a racing game released for the SNES in 1992. It was published by Kemco, and was developed by Gremlin Graphics. It was one of the first racing games launched for the console. The main goal of the game is to dominate the world of motor racing by winning races from several different countries and against many computer rivals.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Top Gear, the player navigates each track using the D-pad and acceleration button. They must race against 20 other CPU cars. There are a number of obstacles like rocks, traffic blockers, or other cars that must be avoided. Besides accelerating and taking turns the game contains a nitro system allowing the player to have 3 speed boosts. During these speed boosts it is possible to travel well over 200 MPH driving downhill and it is easier to turn. The game also allows the player to pull over into the pit-stop to refuel. This costs valuable time but is necessary to continue racing. The pit-stop system adds a layer of strategy because the player must decide when to pull over during the race because it can be hard to catch up again and return to first place.1 Player Mode[CR]Even in 1 Player mode the screen is split in two by a vertical line. The player controls the car on the upper half of the screen, and on the bottom half a CPU car is shown. The CPU on the bottom screen is the best competitor and will almost always come in first or (if the player places first) second place. Depending on how the player places in each race they are awarded with a certain amount of points. These points determine an overall ranking. At the end of the 4 races for each country if the player is ranked 3 or higher then they get the password for the next country and can continue.2 Player Mode[CR]When two players are playing the screen is still split the same way and the second player controls the car on the bottom half. If one player is ranked 3 or higher they both get to continue on to the next country.[CR]Cars[CR]There are four different cars available with varying amounts of tire grip, fuel consumption, acceleration, and top speeds. The white car is generally thought to be the best choice for beginners.Red CarMax Speed: 235 KPH0-100: 6.1 secTire Grip: LowFuel Consumption: HighWhite CarMax Speed: 210 KPH0-100: 3.6 secTire Grip: HighFuel Consumption: LowPurple CarMax Speed: 220 KPH0-100: 5.2 secTire Grip: LowFuel Consumption: HighBlue CarMax Speed: 220 KPH0-100: 4.5 secTire Grip: MidFuel Consumption: Mid[CR]Countries[CR]There are 8 different countries that are featured in the game. Each one contains 4 tracks, each with unique backgrounds and track layouts. The countries and tracks are as follows:United StatesLas VegasLas AngelesNew YorkSan FranciscoBrazilRioMachu PicchuChichen IzraRain ForestJapanTokyoHiroshimaYokohamaKyotoGermanyMunichCologneBlack ForestFrankfurtScandinaviaStockholmCopenhagenHelsinkiOsloFranceParisNiceBordeauxMonacoItalyPisaRomeSicilyFlorenceUnited KingdomLondonSheffieldLoch NessStonehenge[CR]Password System[CR]Top Gear did not feature a save system, instead opting for a password system based on simple text inputs for each country. Each difficulty setting had a different set of passwords.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]The music used in the game consists of original compositions as well as music that has been remixed from the Lotus series of games. There are five different songs: one song for each of the four races in each of the countries, and one for the title music of the game. Music from Top Gear has been used as inspiration for the song Bliss from the British band Muse.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Get 1st place and 2nd place at the same time.[CR]This glitch might be a little hard to do at first, but with a little practice you should be able to easily pull it off on every level. On your last lap, when you are nearing the finish line simply make half of your car (go fast) run into the finishing line. Because of this, the front part of the car will cross (giving you 1st place) and than the car will bounce back and go forward again (giving you 2nd place too).</plot>

				<title_clean>Top Gear 2</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]In Top Gear 2, players race on tracks spanning the globe, earning money for upgrades along the way. Tracks feature backgrounds from each country like Australia, Great Britain and Japan. Some tracks feature weather effects like rain, snow or fog. Each event features 20 racers for the player to drive against. The game uses a password system, rather than saving progress.[CR]Career[CR]The game features a robust career mode featuring 16 territories with 4 tracks from each. After each race, players are given points that go towards that country's ladder ranking. The player must be at the top of the ladder at the end of the 4 races in order to qualify to move on to the next territory. The territories are (in order)Australasia (Australia and New Zealand)BritainCanadaEgyptFranceGermanyGreeceIndiaIrelandItalyJapanScandinaviaSpainSwitzerlandUnited States[CR][B]Upgrades:[/B][CR]In addition to points for rankings, after races players are given money to put towards upgrading cars. Money can also be picked up by driving over icons that sometimes appear on tracks. Players can upgrade:Engine - Boosts top speedDry Tires - Helps the car turn betterWet Tires - Used on rainy tracksGearbox - Increases the number of gearsNitro - Each upgrade adds one more burst of nitro during racesSide/Rear/Front Armor - Decreases the amount of damage takenRespray - Changes the color of the car. Resprays are free upgrades[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 7,7,7,6 and 6 out of ten. Mike Weigand, who gave the score of 6, wrote, "...if you liked Top Gear, then you will probably also like Top Gear 2! This time there are some improvements over the original -- most notably the scrolling is much smoother! Good weather conditions, too".[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Cheat Password[CR]On the Main Menu, choose "Continue Game" and you will see the password screen.[CR]There are some versions that you access the password screen by choosing "Continue" and then "Password". On these versions this cheat doesn't work, because there isn't "?" to type on the password.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Reporters uncover Ackboob's sinister plan[CR]Total Carnage is an Arcade top-down dual-joystick shooter and is often seen as a spiritual successor to Midway's earlier Smash TV. It was developed by Mark Turmell who was also the lead designer for Smash TV. Other similarities between the two titles lies in the sound: Jon Hey composed the music and Ed Boon supplied some voice work for Total Carnage as they both did for Smash TV.[CR]Total Carnage was released across many home consoles along with its original arcade release.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Ackhboob's mutant factory[CR]The year is 1999 and a new world war is brewing. The war is against a country ruled by the evil General Ackboob, and he has closed his country off from the rest of the world. Reporters discover that he is hiding a Baby Milk Factory, but as they dig deeper they find that this is not the truth. The factory is actually manufacturing an army of mutants that could help Ackboob take over the world. The United States sends in only two soldiers, named Captain Carnage and Major Mayhem, to stop Ackboob's evil plan. They are tasked in destroying hordes of mutant troops, rescuing hostages and defeating Genral Ackboob.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Mutant bosses are big and ugly.[CR]Total Carnage is a bloody shooter that plays from a overhead perspective. One to two players can enter a game, and the goal is to shoot all enemies on screen. Each character can face all directions on the screen, and their only ability is to shoot. Different weapons can be collected that will give the players extra power. Each level will have them shooting through small enemies, and they will eventually meet a boss. Each boss is a large mutant monster that has a specific weak point to defeat them. There is the occasional mini game which will have the player pressing a button rapidly. One of the mini games has them attempting the execute General Ackhboob in an electric chair.[CR]Keys[CR]Upon collecting the first key, a message appears that upon collecting 220 keys, it grants the player to reach the Pleasure Dome which contains a huge score bonus.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>You are Woody, a cowboy doll who has come to life in a room full of toys that have come alive too. You've got a pretty nice life, keeping the toys in line, and making sure nothing bad happens. Everything is going great for you until a new toy shows up. He's so cool, all the other toys like him more than they like you. One day, your owner, 6 year old Andy, is going to Pizza Planet, and he wants to bring this new toy. So, in an act of jealousy, you try to get rid of him by knocking him behind a drawer. But it backfires and you send him out the window! Now the toys hate you. Can you get the new toy back and regain the other toys' respect?[CR]I'm a fan of Toy Story. I'm sure several of you are too. This game is a very addicting one, and a very challenging one. The music is very good, and it doesn't sound too scratchy like in some of the other games. You get to play along with the movie, although it has some added elements to make the game more challenging and longer, thus taking away its accuracy to the movie. I'll tell you what else makes this game cool - it has several modes of play! There are levels where you are above the action, and one level where it's first-person! But there's a lot of screen-scrolling, so get used to that.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]You're trying to rescue the great Buzz Lightyear, a toy that took your place as Andy's favorite toy. Even though you hate him, you must work with him if you want to get back to Andy in one piece. And there are a lot of things that are going to give you death instead of help. A claw machine, Sid, Sid's evil dog Scud, and a deadly rocket that is taped to Buzz Lightyear's back. Also, you can't save your progress, so once you're dead, you start from the beginning. But you get a certain amount of lives and hit points in each life to beat every level, and eventually, you can earn continues. Plus you have Rex, the not-so-terrifying toy dinosaur, your pull-string (which you use as your only weapon) Roller-bob, and eventually, Buzz Lightyear himself. How? Well, watch the movie or go and hit the "Play Now" button and play the game to find out.[CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]A Button - Whip[CR]B Button - Jump[CR]X Button - Whip[CR]Y Button - Jump[CR]Start Button - Skip storyline, Pause[CR][B]Hints:[/B][CR]Extra Lives:[CR]Want an extra 2 lives?

				<title_clean>Troddlers</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Troddlers is a puzzle game developed by Atod. It features a pair of apprentices, Hokus and Pokus, as they travel through various stages to recover tiny creatures known as Troddlers. Players can remove and place blocks in the stage (similar to Solomon's Key) in order to direct the Troddlers, which walk around based on a fixed set of programmed directions, to the exits.[CR]The game was released on the Amiga initially for a European market in 1992, and was ported to the Super Nintendo by Seika the following year in both the US and Europe. It also received an MS-DOS port. The SNES version  was one of a handful of games to support the SNES Mouse peripheral.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls Hokus alone in single-player, and a second player can assume the role of Pokus for co-operative play. The goal for each stage is to funnel the Toddlers to nearby exits. Troddlers will continue to walk in one direction until they hit a wall, at which point they will walk up the wall (and then across the ceiling). To help them reach the exit, the player can pick up and place blocks in stage. The number they can pick up is dependent on a hard limit and the number of blocks available in each stage. If the[CR]If the player places blocks in their path, the Troddlers will walk over the block. If they place it on top of Troddlers, it will kill them. There are also zombie Troddlers, which the player has to destroy. If a zombie Troddler reaches an exit, they are safe and cannot be destroyed, which usually means that the stage needs to be reset.[CR]There are also many different blocks with various effects, and there are occasionally enemies to avoid as well.[CR]</plot>

Like many football games of the era, it uses a slanted perspective of the football field positioned behind the first player's team. Players call plays and attempt to score touchdowns within the time limit.[CR]The game has customization options as well, from minor changes like the state of the field to how the football season will play out in the season mode (the real life 1993 NFL season schedule is built in as a default). There are also exhibition and playoff modes available.[CR]The game was originally released for Genesis and Super Nintendo in 1994. It was ported to the Atari Jaguar the following year.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Players take on the challenge of one of the most beautiful and notorious golf courses in the world: Pebble Beach. These eighteen-holes demand accuracy, finesse, and even at times brute strength. The famous beach-side course is littered with sand-bunkers as well as sweeping fairways and cliff-side greens. [CR]Game play takes a classic approach - players control a selected golfer from a third-person perspective. Swing-control is displayed as a power and accuracy meter with which players must start and stop accordingly. Again, the classic-style putting system, complete with a topographic grid, lets the player know of the slope and elevation of the three-dimensional putting surface.[CR]As there are no other courses to play, this game is a tribute and testament to the challenging course-design of Pebble Beach Golf Links.</plot>

As with that game, Waialae Country Club takes place in a prestigious US golf course (the eponymous Waialae) and features all 18 holes to play through.[CR]As with T&amp;E Soft's other golf sims, more care is taken towards realism and simulation elements, meaning it is drier and more difficult than many other console golf games. It takes full advantage of the SNES's mode 7 capabilities to depict a 3D course. [CR]</plot>

The earlier games in the series, True Golf Classics: Waialae Country Club and True Golf Classics: Pebble Beach Golf Links, both took place on actual golf courses but Wicked 18 presents an entirely fictional course with outlandish and even fantastical elements such as lava and floating islands.[CR]The game uses the series' now traditional 3D view for each course, presenting a rough idea of the topography of the area and the distance from the hole. Wicked 18 has a considerable amount of higher walls and cliffs than a normal mostly flat golf course, and the player can experiment banking shots off these steep inclines.[CR]As was the case with Waialae Country Club and Pebble Beach Golf Links, the game saw releases for the Sega Genesis, the Super Nintendo and the NEC PC-9801. Wicked 18 was also released for the 3DO.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The story is set in a post apocalyptic Earth in the year AD 2151. To the inhabitants on Earth it seems like the only chance for a decent life is to fight, in a "survival of the fittest" scenario. A man named Jado finds a powerful blue fighting armor and calls himself "The Fighting King". With it, he quickly gains control of the world. Using his newfound power, he erects a tower with six guards. Many try to take Jado's power away, but unfortunately, they die in their attempt. Some weeks after the building of the tower, a tournament is held all over the world to see who is the strongest. Of the many tournaments, only four people are chosen. Now they need to fight each other to see who is going in the tower.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Tuff E Nuff[CR]Fight as boss against CPU[CR]On the Main Menu press Left(3), Right(3), Left(7) then press Start.[CR]Slow motion[CR]During a 1-player game press start on controller two[CR]Play as Bosses in the Two-Player Mode[CR]This is to allow Bosses to be playable in the Two-Player Mode Input the Boss code, hit the Reset button, then input[CR]the code listed below.

				<title_clean>Turn and Burn - No-Fly Zone</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Turn and Burn: No-Fly Zone is a first-person combat flight sim for the Super Nintendo. Like many combat flight sims, the goal is to shoot down enemy aircraft by tracking them with the radar and then targeting them with their various weapons. The player's vehicle is an F-14 Tomcat fighter jet.[CR]The game was released in Japan as Super Dogfight, where it was published by Pack-In-Video. Absolute Entertainment published the game in the US, and Sony Imagesoft in Europe.[CR]The game is the sequel to Turn and Burn: The F-14 Dogfight Simulator, a 1992 Game Boy game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In Turn and Burn: No-Fly Zone players fly an F-14 Tomcat fighter jet under "the President's orders" to maintain a no-fly zone. They are equipped with 3 types of missiles, machine guns, and access to one aerial refuel every level. A typical mission consists of taking off from a carrier, shooting several airplanes or land installations, and returning to the carrier. The shooting gameplay is fairly typical for the era, with the player able to perform simple aerial maneuvers over a uniform blue ocean, and primarily locating enemies using a radar. Objects in the sky and ocean are rendered using sprites which change in size based on their distance from the player. There are only a few sizes of sprites for each object, but the game runs at a higher frame rate than many similar games of the time.[CR]The cockpit view is notable for being very detailed and providing the player with a wealth of information. It also includes some light graphical touches, such as a flight yoke that moves as though it was being controlled by the player. However, the cockpit takes up approximately two thirds of the screen, leaving little room for the player to actually see enemies. Pressing the triggers pulls up left and right over the shoulder views respectively, which also include a detailed portrait of the pilot and part of the plane.[CR]The difficulty of landing necessitated that the developers include a separate mode accessible from the main menu that allows players to practice it.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Twisted Tales of Spike McFang, The</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Spike McFang is a linear adventure RPG for the SNES. It was developed by Red Entertainment and published by Naxat in Japan, and by Bullet-Proof Software in the US.[CR]Spike travels through the different cartoon-like isles of Vladamasco, using his cape, his hat (which can be upgraded), and a deck of cards to save his world. Most of the game is spent in battle, collecting coins and experience, but there are a few moments in towns where the player can upgrade Spike's hat and buy new cards. There are few different hats to buy, and the cards are only nominally useful, with a few exceptions. Upon leaving one section of the game it becomes impossible to return, but there is very little exploration to be done.Japanese Version[CR]The Twisted Tales of Spike McFang is known as Chou Makai Taisen! Dorabochan (Super Devil Wars! Dorabochan) in Japan.[CR]The differences between the two versions are small, the most notable would be the scaling of difficulty: the game gets harder as Spike gains levels and his health does not regenerate. Another striking difference is that in order for the game to sell in North America the game was made more family-friendly replacing Spike's hunger for the hearts of his enemies by turning them into adorable garlic clovers and giving spike a thirst for tomatoes and tomato juice.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]Spike has two physical attacks and a special attack, which includes:Don't Get Dizzy!The Cape Spin: A basic attack that causes damage to nearby enemies. The longer the attack button is pressed, the more the character will spin. Spinning too much will cause Spike will get dizzy.Hat Throw: Allows Spike to cause his hat to float and soar towards the enemy dealing damage according to how many times the weapon hits the enemy. With each new hat the offense remains exactly the same but the way the hat is thrown changes. While the first hat performs a boomerang attack, the final hat in the game is a path clearing homing missile. The only method of increasing offense and defense is to level up, but unlike most games doing this will doubles that stat instead of the usual incremental bonuses.Cards: Spike can also use cards that he will receive from NPCs that run stores in the game, these cards differ from restoring life in the form of tomatoes as well as cans of tomato juice to Quake cards that rain stone fish from the sky and shakes the ground.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Debug Menu[CR]At title screen, press Right, Y, B, Left, B, Y, Up, Y, B, Down, B, Y, Select, Select, Select, Left, Right. If done correctly, you will hear a sound. Start the game normally, and press L + R + Start.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Play As Rudy[CR]Go to the title screen and press [B]Down, B, Left, B, Up, Y, Right, Y[/B]. If the trick worked, you'll hear a chime. Now when you beat Felina, Rudy comes to your rescue. As you return to town, you can control him with Controller Two.</plot>

His weapon has smaller forward fire than the others, but it also fires a second stream downward at a 45 degree angle. In the SNES version, Greg recovers from damage faster than the other pilots.[CR]Weapons Shop[CR]During gameplay, the player earns money for each destroyed enemy plane or vehicle wich can be used to buy special weapons or defenses to be used in the next level.

Depending on the stage, the player encounters land, sea and air units. Some red enemies drop a POW, which is used to upgrade the main gun of the players aircraft. The POWs come in green, blue or yellow and each color is worth a different amount of points. Special weapons on the other hand cannot be upgraded.[CR]The players aircraft can take some hits before it is destroyed and has a small period of time where it is invulnerable after each hit.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]It's a little known fact that U.N. Squadron was used in the comic strip Computer Warrior, in which a boy called Bobby Patterson found a secret code which let him play computer games 'for real'. The strip to some degree turned into a marketing tool for publisher U.S.Gold, now known as Eidos, as it became solely their published games that were used as the basis of the 'real game playing' story arcs. Other games included Black Tiger and Zak McCracken.[CR]As such, the stories and characters from Area 88 may well be the only IP to be a manga adapted to video game, westernized with a new title to then be adapted into a comic book story. Perhaps ironically, the hero from Area 88 was recast as a traitorous villain in the U.N. Squadron Computer Warrior storyline.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Ending Extras[CR]Beat the game on Hard or Gamer mode without using continues to see a parade of Mobi-Chans spelling a message at the "Thanks for playing" screen.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Gamer Mode[CR]At the options menu, highlight Game Level with controller one and hold X and A on controller two.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Following the Game Boy spinoff Ultima: Runes of Virtue, this sequel uses action-adventure gameplay similar to the Legend of Zelda games. The game also had an SNES port that featured better graphics but a reduced scope.[CR]The Black Knight has returned and he has kidnapped the eight mayors of Britannia's towns. Once again, the Companions of the Avatar must quest to stop him. Compared to the first game, Runes of Virtue II features a larger game world that actually resembles the Britannia seen in the main games. Specifically, many of its characters and locations seem to be based on their Ultima VI depictions.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Ultima: The False Prophet is a Role-Playing game, developed by Infinity and published by Pony Canyon,which was released in Japan in 1992.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bonus hidden items in your inventory[CR]At any time in the game where you have at least 16 items you can do this.  You need to transfer enough items into your 'bag' in your inventory so that when you scroll to the bottom of your 'bag' and exit your bag there will be no items in your main inventory on the screen.  This can be accomplished early in the game by picking up items until you have at least 16 and moving them all into your 'bag'.  Scroll to the bottom of your 'bag' and exit the 'bag'.  You should be on an inventory screen with no items, including your 'bag'.  You will notice scroll arrows saying you can scroll up or down.  If you scroll down far enough you will find random hidden items.  It is possible to 'move' these items all the way back up to next to your bag.  Using this you can get many of the late game weapons and armor right at the beginning of the game.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Bonus hidden items in your inventory[CR]This glitch can be done at any time, but it works best if you have a fair amount of gold (about 300). From the Castle you start in, head south until you see the sundial, and follow the road eastwards. There are two buildings next to eachother, Iolo's Bows (Run by his apprentice) and a smith to the left of Iolo's Bows. Go to the smith, and buy as much Oil as you can carry. Head to Iolo's bows to the right of the Smith and ask the apprentice about SELL. This will allow you to sell items. The Oil was 4 gold, but you can sell an Oil for 10 gold here, a glitch that allows a profit of 6 gold coins per oil you bought and sold. You end up *more* gold then you had before you bought the Oil.</plot>

				<title_clean>Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The masked ninjas return.[CR]Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is a 2D fighting game developed and released by Midway on November 1995 for arcades.[CR]It is a direct update to Mortal Kombat 3, adding new characters (all of which are the return of masked ninjas), arenas, special moves, and game modes (including an 8-player tournament mode and 2-on-2 team matches), while tweaking gameplay mechanics and character balancing. It is regarded as the most competitive game in the Mortal Kombat franchise (prior to its 2011 reboot). A special version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was later released for consoles (known as Mortal Kombat Trilogy).[CR]In order to free up space on the game's memory, the screens detailing the game's story, as well as all of the biographies and picture endings for the original characters, have been removed. Regardless, the game's story is no different from Mortal Kombat 3 (involving Outworld emperor Shao Kahn's invasion of Earthrealm).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is built off of Mortal Kombat 3 and retains most of its gameplay mechanics. There are four attack buttons (High Punch, High Kick, Low Punch, and Low Kick) and dedicated Block and Run buttons. Players have a "Run Meter", which limits their ability to run forward, and "chain combos", in which players can perform pre-programmed combos (by linking normal attacks together) that ends with an attack that sends the opponent flying. The combos are known for not necessarily requiring the user to be 100% accurate on the timing of the button presses, allowing the player to basically press all the buttons in the combo quickly and the combo would essentially play itself out. Each character has new special moves, chain combos, and gameplay balances.BRUTALITY![CR]Fatalities, Friendships, Babalities, Mercy, and Animalities return from Mortal Kombat 3. However, the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis versions sacrificed Mercy and Animalities for a new type of finishing move: Brutalities. Brutalities are long, complex combo strings that, when performed successfully, end with the victim exploding into a shower of blood and body parts. Brutalities require the player to enter the first ten button presses in the combo, and the game takes over from there, depicting the character beating the other character faster and faster until they explode.[CR]The game also marks the return of the Endurance Match (originally in Mortal Kombat), in which the player must defeat two opponents consecutively instead of one to win a round. The "Choose Your Destiny" screen reflects this, adding one Endurance Matches to each "tower". Additionally, there is a "Master II" difficulty, adding another Endurance Match to the "tower" while making the game more difficult.[CR]More "Kombat Kodes", six-digit codes that are entered cooperatively on the versus screen, have been added, including the ability to change the stage to whatever both players feel like playing. There are now three "Ultimate Kombat Kodes", ten-digit codes that are entered during the Game Over screen, with three new characters to unlock. The Mortal Kombat Arcade Kollection removed Kombat Kodes from the online component in the game.Game Modes[CR]Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 also includes three gameplay modes, each requiring a different amount of credits to start:Mortal Kombat - Traditional game mode with one-on-one fights.4 Player 2-on-2 Kombat - A multiplayer tag-team fight in similar vein to Endurance Matches.8 Player Tournament - A single-elimination tournament for eight players.Shao Kahn's Lost Treasures[CR]New to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 is the concept of Shao Kahn's Lost Treasures, in which completing the game gives the player a choice between a group of bonuses ranging from battling secret characters to watching a demonstration of each Fatality in the game. These groups are restricted by the difficulty the game was completed on. 8-Player Tournament mode also gives the player access to Shao Kahn's Lost Treasures at the end.[CR]Novice Difficulty and higherShows the character's endingPlay a clone of Galaga (only previously accessible through a Kombat Kode or reaching 100 battles)Battle with ErmacBattle with Noob Saibot[CR]Warrior Difficulty and higherRandom TreasureFatality Demonstration #1Fatality Demonstration #2Fatality Demonstration #3Endurance Match against Noob Saibot and Ermac[CR]Master Difficulty and higherEndurance Match against masked Sub-Zero and Noob SaibotEndurance Match against Noob Saibot, Ermac, human Smoke, masked Sub-Zero, and Mileena[CR]Master II DifficultySupreme Demonstration (shows most Fatalities, Babalities, Friendships, and Animalities)[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The 22 playable characters (including the three unlockable characters)[CR]The game includes 19 playable starting characters, two unplayable bosses, four playable secret characters, and one unplayable secret opponent. All of the playable characters (including the previously-hidden Smoke) from Mortal Kombat 3, along with Kitana, Reptile, Jade, and Scorpion from Mortal Kombat II, are the default starting characters in the game. Through new "Ultimate Kombat Kodes", Mileena, a masked Sub-Zero, and a new ninja character (Ermac) are unlockable as playable characters. A pre-indoctrinated version of Smoke, known as Human Smoke, is playable by holding a special button combination when choosing the robotic Smoke.[CR]Noob Saibot is still a hidden, unplayable opponent. However, because of the inclusion of masked male ninjas, he is no longer a palette swap of Kano (except in the Sega Saturn version). Featured in the game's opening gameplay montage is Rain, a dark purple palette swap of the male ninjas that serves as nothing more as a fake hidden character for stirring up rumors. Noob Saibot and Rain, as well as the three unlockable characters, are starting characters in the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis, and Game Boy Advance versions.CharacterDescription (Additional Notes)ActorKitanaKitana is a warrior princess from the realm of Edenia. Although she appears youthful, she is actually well over 10,000 years old. She is key character in the forces of good in the Mortal Kombat universe. Kitana has one of the most damaging projectiles in the game,her Fan Toss. She also has a decent anti-air and her fan-lift which is used to combo after.Becky GableReptileReptile is one of the many ninjas in the Mortal Kombat franchise. As the series has gone on, he's become more outwardly reptilian. His Force Balls are a force to be reckoned with -- slow moving and easy to combo after. Reptile can also go invisible, and has a fast projectile acid spit.John TurkSonyaSonya Blade is a fighter who has appeared in nearly every Mortal Kombat game.Kerri HoskinsJaxMajor Jackson Briggs or "Jax" is a special forces operative from Mortal Kombat II who uses his fists of steel to take down enemies.

Jax also has a projectile and his Ground Pound, which will hit any ground-based enemy.John ParrishNightwolfNightwolf is an Apache shaman who joins Mortal Kombat to protect the world. Nightwolf is a great ranged character, with some good projectiles and a counter to projectiles also. He also has a fantastic combo-extender in his axe lift, which can hit a number of times.Sal DivitaJadeJade is an Edenian fighter who was first featured as a hidden character in Mortal Kombat II.

The Bank and Hidden Portal from Mortal Kombat 3 are removed. Noob Saibot's Dorfen and The Church, despite not being in the arena rotation, are now playable via new Kombat Kodes, which allow the players to fight in any stage they choose. This brings the total number of stages to 16. The level rotation works a bit differently, as the first five stages loop once before moving on to the Mortal Kombat 3 stages. The Balcony is always the stage played when facing Motaro. The Pit 3 is always the stage featured when fighting against Shao Kahn. Noob Saibot's Dorfen is always the stage featured when facing Noob Saibot. Scislac Busorez is always the stage featured when fighting Mileena, Ermac. or masked Sub-Zero.[CR]Scorpion's Lair includes both a Stage Fatality (in which the player uppercuts the opponent to the lava behind them), and a mid-match stage transition to Kahn's Kave. The Subway and The Soul Chamber still transition to The Street and The Balcony.

It never appeared on the Sony PlayStation due to Sega buying exclusive rights to release it on 32-bit CD-based consoles (as a response to Sony buying exclusive rights to release Mortal Kombat 3 on 32-bit CD-based consoles a year before). To get around this, a rare, special add-on peripheral for the PlayStation was made that upgraded copies of Mortal Kombat 3 to Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3. The game was later infamously ported to the Game Boy Advance on December 12, 2001 under the name "Mortal Kombat Advance". It is considered one of the worst fighting games of all time. An arcade-perfect port of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was later released on November 11, 2007 for the Nintendo DS under the name "Ultimate Mortal Kombat", which also included online multiplayer via Wi-Fi and a port of Puzzle Kombat from Mortal Kombat: Deception. Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was also bundled in special "Premium Edition" copies of the PlayStation 2 version of Mortal Kombat: Armageddon. The game was also loosely ported to the iPhone and iPad by EA Mobile on December 16, 2010. (Restricting the character count to 6 starter characters and 2 hidden characters, while remaking all assets in 3D)[CR]An online-enabled version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was released on the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade for 800 Microsoft Points ($10) on October 20, 2006, days before its intended Wednesday release. This version included 12 achievements worth 200 Gamerscore, ranging from performing certain finishing moves (online or offline) to completing the single-player campaign. The Achievements are notorious for having strange point values, such as 12. This version also includes online leaderboards, adjustable screen sizes (with support for widescreen and standard televisions), and an online mode similar to the "Quarter Match" mode on the Xbox Live Arcade version of Super Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting. This version was granted "Arcade Hits" status due to high sales, reducing its price by half. However, in February 2010, Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was removed from the Xbox Live Marketplace due to Midway losing the game's publishing rights. The standalone version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 never returned to Xbox 360 under new publisher, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Instead, a new release titled Mortal Kombat: Arcade Kollection was released on August 31, 2011 for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and later on February 1, 2012 for Games for Windows Live. This new release featured another online-enabled version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, as well as online-enabled versions of Mortal Kombat II and the original Mortal Kombat.iOS VersioniOS Icon[CR]A version of Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 was released for iOS in December, 2010 by EA. Rather than using digitized sprites of filmed actors, all the characters are rendered in 3D. Although the moves and buttons from the original game are included, a simpler set of buttons and moves were created to make play easier using the touch screen. The new layout has a "special" button, which is usually mapped to a character's signature special move. As an example, instead of back-back-low punch for Scorpion's spear, the player just has to hit the "special" button. Also instead of high and low punch and high and low kick, there are just punch and kick buttons. Fatalities are also included, along with babalities, friendships, brutalities, and animalities. While the arenas are the same as in previous versions of the game, they are also newly designed for the iOS version. Uppercutting opponents into other stages is still possible, as well as stage specific fatalities.[CR]Playable characters include:Sub-ZeroScorpionKitanaNightwolfJaxSheevaSonya BladeLiu KangStrykerErmac - an unlockable characterJade - an unlockable character[CR]Four modes are available:Arcade: Standard one player arcade mode.

				<plot>In the future, Earth must protect itself from alien invaders, a task handled by the Science Special Search Party. However, they are not alone in this endeavor. After crashing his ship on Earth while in pursuit of the evil alien Bemular, the super-being Ultraman is here to help whenever the attacking aliens prove too much for humanity alone to handle. Standing hundreds of feet tall with incredible strength and amazing abilities, he can only remain on Earth for a few minutes, and so must defeat his foes before his power drains completely.[CR]Based on the popular television show from 1967, Ultraman directly follows the story of its source material. Cast in the role of the titular Ultraman, the player must defeat many of the same monsters that appeared in the original series. Taking the appearance of a 1-on-1 fighting game, Ultraman can punch, kick, and grapple his opponent, as well as use a variety of various special moves that must be charged. However, in order to actually defeat his opponent, Ultraman must deplete their continually-recharging life bar, and at that moment hit with his most powerful special attack: the Specium Beam. As the game continues, different enemies may even find ways to avoid this most formidable attack, and Ultraman must adapt... Each stage has a time limit of only three minutes, and there are three lives and no continues.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Uniracers, or Unirally in PAL territories, is a unicycle racing game for the Super Nintendo. Taking place in the "Uni-verse", players control a sentient unicycle, created by the 'Unigod' for the sole purpose of racing other sentient unicycles.Uniracers is a game where tricks are not only a device for showing off, but are also vital for beating some of the computer-controlled unicycles.There are three different types of tracks.Race: Simple point-A-to-point-B race. First one to reach the finish line wins. There are two of these in each tour.Circuit: Like a race, but there are a number of laps to complete before the unicycle finishes.Stunt: A unique mode, there are no CPU unicycles in Stunt tracks. Instead, the player must reach a predetermined point goal within 45 seconds to pass the course successfully.The track layout in every Tour goes Race, Circuit, Stunt, Race, Circuit.[CR]Playable Unicycles[CR]There are 18 unicycles that can be chosen.Mike: Red UnicycleMartin: Dark Green UnicycleAmy: Orange UnicycleMichelle: Yellow-Green UnicycleDave: Grey UnicycleCarol: Pink UnicycleKen: Purple UnicycleAlice: Green UnicycleAndrew: Blue UnicycleMelissa: Yellow UnicycleMalcolm: Teal UnicycleColin: Light Blue UnicycleTony: Black UnicycleCraig: Light Green UnicycleRobbie: Maroon UnicycleSteve: Light Blue Unicycle[CR]Tour Layout[CR]There are nine different Tours, including 4 initially marked off Tours, and one hidden Tour.

Note that these effects cannot be activated in two-player action.Barf Mode: The background scrolls crazily, making it disorienting for the player.Invisible Track: Makes the track invisible.Mirror Track: Flips the screen upside down, making it a little tricky to navigate.Reverse Controls: Left moves the player's unicycle to the right, and vice versa.Slow Motion: The game slows down, making it a little easier.Super Bounce Mode: Makes the unicycle bounce very high when it lands.Hedgehog Mode: Makes the game even slower than Slow Motion.[CR]Miscellany[CR]There are a number of interesting things about Uniracers.A group of up to eight players can compete for Unicycle glory in League Mode.The game disallows using swear words, giving the message "Not Cool Enough". This message is also given for entering the name "SEGA" or "SONIC".There is a league mode, where 8 players can join a league and face off, two at a time, for bragging rights.The game saves the top three best times for each course, the unicycle that set the time, and each of the 16 unicycles' best times for each course.If the game is beaten, the player is rewarded with two tabloid-esque newspapers, and a "Whodunnit" screen, with caricatures of the creators' faces on unicycles.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Also Uncool[CR]SATAN is also deemed "uncool" a choice of name (you're told "Not cool enough" when you attempt to choose the name).[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Also Uncool[CR]When you change a bike name, if you put SEGA or SONIC as a name, it'll be written ''Not cool enough''.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy game[CR]If you want an easy gold medal, select a course you got a silver medal on and select ''GOLD'' with the arrow. Press START and it will change between BRONZE, SILVER, and GOLD, select BRONZE and race against the easiest opponent for a gold medal! Works with silver too, but in silver, you can only select Bronze or Silver.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Easy game[CR]Normally, you need a minimum of 2 to make a league, but you can have a league with just one person! If you want to try that, you need to get yourself and one other player into the league. (2 players) [CR]After making the league, delete the 2nd player you entered in and check the league again, it should be only you in the league. [CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Universal Soldier</title_clean>
				<plot>Universal Soldier was in development by a company called Carolco and was to be published by Accolade. The game was actually a sequel to the Manfred Trentz game, Turrican, but the character sprite was changed so that it could be rebranded as a movie tie-in. A rom of what appears to be the complete version of this game exists. The enemies and gameplay closely match Turrican, as to be expected. It is unknown why this game was canceled. Genesis and Game Boy versions of this game were released, and Turrican 2 was released on various computer platforms. Nintendo Power commented in the October 1992 issue that it was similar to Contra, but complained about the poor controls.

				<title_clean>Untouchables, The</title_clean>
				<plot>This version of the The Untouchables is different from the other versions.  While the other versions are based on the Brian De Palma film starring Kevin Costner, this version is based on the 1993 remake of the original 1960's series that starred Robert Stack.[CR]There are five different assignments (missions) to choose from, each with their own set time limit.  The first mission is set in the over the shoulder, third-person perspective in an alleyway using a shotgun to take down mobsters hiding in buildings.  The second mission is a 2D side-scroller set in a warehouse where the player must defend against gangsters and pick up counterfeiting plates scattered throughout a warehouse.  The third mission is a side-scrolling shooter, located on a dock, where the player uses a tommy gun to take out various bad guys scattered throughout the stage.  The fourth mission is a top-down shooter located at the top of a courthouse where the player must rescue hostages while defending against various bad guys.  The fifth and final mission is a first-person shooter located on the rooftops of Chicago against Al Capone himself. [CR]The story is told between missions through old-time looking newspapers that report on the success or the failure of the player's mission.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Urban Strike is the follow up to Jungle Strike and continues the story told in Jungle Strike. Players command a variety of aircraft and ground units in order to stop H.R. Malone, a politician and wealthy leader who plans on ascending to total domination using a superweapon.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Urban Strike follows the Strike series' tried and true isometric game play and mission structure which is virtually untouched from the previous two games. Game mechanics also remain the same as the copilot system and rearming process all continue. New to the series are three on foot missions where players take control of the pilot and must go inside a structure armed with a machine gun and rocket launcher in order to rescue an important person or destroy the complex.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Following the defeat of Ibn Kilbaba and the supposed death of the Drug Lord, it would seem as the world is safe again from terrorism. But the rise of a new politician, H.R. Malone, gains the attention of the world and of STRIKE. Despite an undercover agent placed within Malone's organization, STRIKE does not know the plans Malone has for world domination. The informant is killed and again STRIKE calls in their top pilot to uncover the plot around this mysterious figure. Intelligence gathered from Hawaii reveals that Malone is actually Carlos Ortega, the Drug Lord, who had undergone plastic surgery to cover up his disfigured face and used his connections to reassert himself on the world stage. STRIKE again targets Malone's strategic investments that include oil rigs, auto factories and even Alcatraz Island. The search for Malone ends in Las Vegas as he makes his last stand inside the holding cell for superweapon, a giant laser. Malone is picked up with a bomb vest on and dropped directly into the superweapon, ridding the world of another despot and another threat averted thanks to the efforts of STRIKE.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Level Passwords[CR]Enter the code below at the password screen.

				<title_clean>Utopia - The Creation of a Nation</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Utopia: The Creation of a Nation (often referred to as simply Utopia) is a real-time strategy game set in the far future across various distant planets. The goal of the game is to create a colony, build it up by collecting resources and creating new structures, raising armies to take down enemy forces (unique to each planet and each scenario) and reaching a sufficiently high quality of life to achieve "Utopia" status. At which point, the player has cleared the scenario and can move onto the next.[CR]The game is highly reminiscent of both Maxis's SimCity and Bullfrog's Populous. It borrows many of the former's elements in its construction elements, such as having a series of advisers to tell the player where they should focus, and borrows the latter's isometric viewpoint and GUI.[CR]The game was originally released on the Atari ST, Amiga and DOS in 1991. It later received a Super Nintendo port, which was published in the US by Jaleco, by Epic/Sony Records in Japan and by Konami in Europe. This port is one of a handful of Super Nintendo games to use the SNES Mouse. The computer versions received an expansion data disk named Utopia: The New Worlds, sold separately.[CR]</plot>

Like the cool dude he is, Bart decides to give it a try, and that's pretty much the set up for the game. The VR machine is actually a wheel-like torture device that Bart is placed in and then spun. The wheel is adorned with various level icons and whichever one Bart's heads is pointing towards when the wheel stops is the level he must complete. The levels vary in theme and gameplay style, but each start/end with a brief cutscene and also contain a brief cutscene should if they are failed.[CR]Like previous games in based upon the Simpsons license such as Bart vs The Space Mutants and Bart's Nightmare the game is infamous for it's high degree of difficulty. One notable example is the waterslide level where the only way to choose the correct path (Besides luck) is to follow a faint arrow that appears on another swimmers shirt. This is never explained to the player and even knowing this the arrow is still hard to spot.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Each level in Virtual Bart consists of a different gameplay style and mechanic and are discussed in more detail below. Level names slightly embellished to add flavor.Dino Bart[CR]Bart assumes the role of a dinosaur and must fight off prehistoric versions of Springfieldians while climbing Mt. Springfield in what is otherwise a very typical side-scrolling platformer level.Baby Bart[CR]Now Bart reverts back into his child-like self and goes about exploring Springfield in his own devil-may-care-with-a-diaper sort of way. Again, this is another side-scroller with a heavier reliance on skilled jumps.Piggy Bart[CR]The final side-scroller of the game, Piggy Bart has now turned Bart into a pig who must escape the Krusty Klown Pork Factory with all of his porky brethren. This time though, he'll have to deal in a more maze-like side-scroller gathering keys and avoiding guards.Bart vs. Mt. Splashmore[CR]A Mode-7 feast for the eyes as Bart rides down a water slide at Mt.Splashmore. Gameplay consists of guiding Bart down the slide in a race against time avoiding other swimmers and where taking the wrong turn could result in precious lost seconds or instant death.Bart vs. The Class Photo[CR]In an effort to avoid taking a class picture, Bart hides out behind the bushes at Springfield Elementary and throws tomatoes and eggs at his classmates (since if they're all messy, they can't take the picture, naturally). With limited ammunition, each shot must count, and hitting teachers or other non-children (while they're not distracted anyways) results in an instant game over.Mad Bart: Beyond Thunderdome[CR]This game is a clear homage to Road Rash and Mad Max. In it, Bart is in a destroyed Springfield after the nuclear power plant finally melted down due to the workers' incompetence, and now he must drive his motorcycle to his home while avoiding various hazards and other drivers. The school bullies take up their role as antagonists, and, like Mt. Splashmore, Bart has only a limited amount of health and time in order to complete his mission.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Vortex is a third-person mech shooter originally released for the SNES in 1994. It was one of a handful of games to use the Super FX Chip developed by Argonaut Games, which are also Vortex's developers. This chip allowed for more sophisticated polygonal graphics, which Vortex uses for its central shapeshifting mech protagonist and the various enemies and other obstacles in each mission.[CR]The game puts the player in the cockpit of a giant robot who can shapeshift. Relatively unique for a console game at the time the gameplay was mostly in 3D with the main character able to move around planets in any direction they saw fit. The main gimmick for the game was that the mech could transform into other vehicles, all of which had different strengths and weaknesses, such as improved speed with higher fuel consumption. Each transformation requires a different button combination, which the player is forced to memorize.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In the year 2003 geneticists tried to create the perfect soldier. Something went wrong however, and three new life forms turned against their creators: Brutally savage Orcs, cybernetic androids called Cromes and genetically enhanced human soldiers code named M.A.R.S. Players take control of a secretly assembled force and must try to restore order.[CR]War 2410 is a turn-based strategy game in which players move various units, such as mechs, tanks, troops or planes over a grid-map. Units differ in movement and attacking range. Some ground units cannot attack air units and vice versa. Terrain also affects combat as some types of terrain, like trees or buildings improve a units defense. Attacked units always counterattack as long as the attacker is within range. The goal of most missions is to destroy all enemy units, while it is sometimes necessary to capture the enemies' bases. Units cannot not be improved or modified and every mission starts with all units already in place.</plot>

				<plot>An alien race named Kyllen has enslaved humanity. On the planet Joyec, rebels managed to take the Kyllen by surprise and seize one of their battle fleets. The player must now guide their efforts in trying to throw over the Kyllen. [CR]War 3010 is a turn-based strategy game in which players move spaceships over a grid-map. There are different types of ships, such as Fighters, Marauders or Destroyers, that differ in movement range and weapon power. Weapon power is also divided into long and short range, i.e. a ship that is very good at long range combat may have poor close ranged weapons etc. During combat, the following actions can be chosen from a menu: Movement, Attacking, terrain information, unit information, a map of the battlefield, overview of all units, including those of the enemy; and an option to scout planets for technology. When an attacking unit is within range of an attacked unit, the attacked unit will always counter-attack (if it isn't destroyed first). In later missions it becomes possible to scout planets for technology and upgrade ships, as well as take control of space stations to build new ships. Ships cannot be taken into the next mission however.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The main menu.[CR]Wario's Woods is a match-three puzzle game developed and published by Nintendo for both the Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Released in 1994, the NES version has the distinction of being the very last game published for the platform in North America.[CR]The game's plot follows Toad, who is walking through what he assumes to be Toadstool's Garden. It is revealed, however that he has wandered into Wario's Woods and become lost, whilst Wario's monsters invade the Mushroom Kingdom. Wanda, Birdo and Toad all fight the monsters.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game plays similarly to Puyo Puyo. Toad is the main hero, with Birdo providing encouragement and Wanda helping Toad by giving him bombs to destroy the monsters. Monsters must be lined up with at least three in a row of a color with at least one bomb to be removed. Toad can pick up and drop monsters and bombs one at a time, and he can also run up the walls of the tree.[CR]If Toad takes too long to complete a level, Wario grabs Birdo and replaces Wanda with a Pidgit, both of whom throw more monsters at Toad.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]NES VersionWarioFuzzSpudSqueakBeakerScramDovoSpookAkuman[CR][B]Multiplayer:[/B][CR]The game includes a two-player versus mode. Monster types, initial height, and drop speed can be adjusted before the match. The first player to clear the playing field of monsters or crush the opponent wins the round. A best-of-five system decides the overall winner. Wins and losses of the two players are tracked persistently with four save files available.TacticsClearing diagonal lines causes the big block to rise on the player's side. A line of three causes it to rise by one row, a line of four by two, etc.Clearing lines of four causes the opponent's block to drop by one row, five by two, etc.Clearing a line of five or more causes a crystal of a color (possibly the one with the least monsters on screen) to appear. Destroying the crystal causes all the monsters of its color to disappear.Chain reactions cause the big block to rise on the player's side and cause a column of monsters of a color to appear on the opponent's side.Clearing two (or more) lines simultaneously causes an egg (or more) to appear on the opponent's side. If the egg hatches, a row of monsters of a specific color will appear.[CR]</plot>

This is done by following a grid-like map of the sector, and selecting areas to warp to with the ship's finite warp drive reserves.[CR]When in dogfights with aliens or asteroids, the game switches to a first-person view and the player can scroll in 3D space to find their opponents and shoot them down. It will often involve a lot of chasing and leading shots to properly hit the fast-moving enemy targets. The player has three lives per campaign: the campaign is failed if all three lives are lost and the player must restart.[CR]As the player progresses and completes more campaigns (which can be selected in any order), they will go up ranks and their ship will be upgraded up to three times, with each iteration having better weaponry to use.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>One of the many hockey games released, this version not only let the player control Gretzky, but other major players of the time as well such as Mario Lemieux, Eric Lindros, Mark Messier among many others, 600 total.  It also features the 26 NHL teams at the time as well as 6 International teams to choose from.[CR]The gameplay is similar to many other hockey games with the standard modes such as Exhibition, Season, Playoffs or even a "Just Play" option that instantly took the player to a random game.  There is also a "Simulation Mode" that gives the game an authentic feel complete with penalties or an "Arcade Mode" that was more action oriented and with less rules.  A battery back-up keeps extensive track of stats and has a two-player option as well.</plot>

In the game, Wayne and his friend Garth are sucked into the Zoltar the Gelatinous Cube arcade machine mentioned in the movie. They must chase down a mysterious purple blob that captured Wayne's blond-haired friend. Released in 1993, this game came out on the  Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Sega Genesis and the Game Boy.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Robo Elvis battle[CR]Wayne's World is a combination of platforming and shooting. Wayne's main weapon is a guitar, which he can strum to attack with sound waves. These waves can be increased by finding amp upgrades in various levels. The player will face several wacky enemies based on the location, such as a man-eating donut in the donut shop or a person with a mohawk at a backstage level. There is a total of five stages with three levels each. Each level ends with Garth getting recaptured by the large purple blob.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego? is the first game in the Carmen Sandiego edutainment series of adventure games from Broderbund Software. In this game, the player is cast in the role of a detective with the ACME Detective Agency tasked with solving thefts committed by members of V.I.L.E., a criminal organization headed by the mysterious Carmen Sandiego. A world atlas was bundled with the game in order to assist players with certain clues.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]At the start of each case, the player begins by traveling to the scene of the crime. By questioning witnesses, clues are gathered which point towards the thief's characteristics, as well as his or her next destination. It is the player's responsibility to gather the information and interpret it correctly. Once the player has enough clues, a warrant for a suspect can be issued. After tailing the suspect from country to country, the player will eventually catch up and, if it's the correct suspect, make an arrest.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego is an educational adventure game from Broderbund Software and the sequel to their 1988 computer game Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego. In the game, the player uses a variety of clues linking a time and a place along with hints regarding the criminal's physical characteristics or preferences from people in each time period in order to narrow down on a single suspect and catch them before you run out of usable hours on a time machine called the Chronoskimmer.[CR]Konami ported a version of the game over to the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991. A special copy of the New American Desk Encyclopedia including Konami game advertisements was included with the game to help players make sense of the various clues, time periods, and locations throughout the game.[CR]The game was later ported to the SNES and the Sega Genesis by Hi Tech Expressions and Electronic Arts respectively.[CR]A television game show loosely based on the game also titled Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego? aired from 1996 to 1998 on PBS.[CR]When released, the NES version was awarded the following scores from Electronic Gaming Monthly: 5,7,5,6 saying, "a very interesting and sometimes educational quest".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Whizz is a platformer developed by Flair Software Ltd., a UK developer, for a multitude of systems. It was originally released for PC DOS in 1994, before being ported to the SNES, PlayStation, Sega Saturn and the Commodore Amiga as well as the Amiga's CD-based equivalent the Amiga CD32.[CR]Whizz stars the titular character Whizz, a rabbit dressed in a magician's outfit, being chased by his arch-nemesis Ratty in his blimp.[CR]He has to escape Ratty through 4 worlds:South Seas BeachesFrozen Arctic WasteGreen Grassed CastleIndoor World of Gamesville[CR]And ultimately reach his own Hot Air Balloon at the end of each level.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Whizz is viewed from an isometric view, its levels are timed and littered with enemies and obstacles; Whizz has a jump and spin attack to deal with these. Throughout each level there are special "Doors" which are made of a specific material (Ice, Wood, Brick and Iron) these can be broken by a spin attack if the player has the "Door Breaker", which is effectively a "key" that is made up of the same material of the door. Only one key can be carried at a time so in later levels backtracking is necessary.[CR]Each time an enemy is killed it has a chance of dropping a Red or Blue Mushroom (Red heals, Blue poisons), certain enemies are indestructible, these are indicated by red and white markings. Hourglasses increase the amount of time left in the level, while Gems and Flags give points (200 and 50 respectively) and collected Flags provide a point bonus at the end of the level.[CR]In each level of a world (there are four levels for each world) there is a hidden Rocket, which will award 1000 points for launching it and an extra life when all four are launched in a world.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Players can choose Clint or Annie[CR]Wild Guns was developed and published by Natsume (except for Europe, where the game was published by Titus Interactive) originally in 1994. The game has a collaboration of settings with both western and science-fiction themes. The protagonists are from the cowboy western era, and the enemies are various robots as well as other various sci-fi themed enemies.[CR]The game was eventually rereleased on the Wii's Virtual Console on May 31, 2010. It was also added to the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2014.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Annie's family has been murdered by a fierce gang, and she plans to seek vengeance. She then finds a bounty hunter named Clint, and asks for his help in getting her revenge. Though Clint is reluctant to take her along, Annie insists that she's as good a shot as he is. Annie and Clint will fight alongside each other in attempt to take down the human and robot gangs who murdered Annie's family. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Many enemies don't seem common in a western[CR]WIld Guns is primarily an on-rails, Arcade style shooter. The characters, Clint and Annie, are shown on screen, and the player can move the character and shooting cursor around for combat. The characters are able to use a jumping and dodging maneuver to avoid obstacles on the screen. They'll also be able to pick up various weapons that fit the western theme such as a shotgun or Gatling gun.[CR]There are six levels in Wild Guns, and each has multiple areas to shoot through. Each area has its own time limit and quota of enemies to shoot, eventually leading to an encounter with a boss. If the player does not shoot all the enemies in time they will not receive a bonus, but will still be allowed to continue to the next area.[CR]The game also supports a two-player co-operative mode. One player controls Annie while the other controls Clint. By pressing the face buttons at the character select screen, the player can determine what color palette their character uses. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>This is one of the compilations that game companies occasionally come up with. The games are as follows:[CR]Defender: In this side-scrolling space shooter, you have to defeat all the enemies to continue to the next level.[CR]Defender II: The sequel to Defender. In addition to all the features in the original, you can warp to the other side of the planet.[CR]Joust: Knock all the enemies off the vultures and collect the eggs.[CR]Robotron: 2084: Shoot the robots with your laser to proceed to the next level. Remember, the last human family's fate is in your hands.[CR]Sinistar: Your goal in this game is to mine Sinibombs from asteroids and defeat Sinistar (the big white guy floating around). Also beware of the little aliens waiting to attack you.[CR]I like the fact that Williams ported these games to SNES, but I don't get to see the attract screens. I would rather play the games in their Shockwave versions and in Midway Arcade Treasures (PS2, Xbox, GCN) than play ports that don't have the feel of the original.[CR]I will list the controls for the games in the order that they're presented in the main menu.[CR][B]Directions:[/B][CR]Relive the moments of your favorite arcade hits from the '80s.

				<title_clean>Wing Commander</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wing Commander is a single-player flight game that popularized the space flight simulator genre and paved the way for games such as the X-Wing/TIE Fighter series. A war rages between the Terran Confederation and the cat-like alien Kilrathi. The player is a rookie pilot on the Terran capital ship the TCS Tiger's Claw. Cinematic intros and a sythesized orchestral score provide a space opera feel.[CR]The single player campaign consists of a branching story arc that begins with the player in control of a lightly powered patrol craft. Continued success will lead to the unlocking of better equipped vessels. Failure will lead to missions with overwhelming odds, possibly resulting in the destruction of the Tiger's Claw and the end of the campaign. Campaign progress is broken up by adventure game style breaks in the pilot's lounge. The player can communicate with wingmates and fellow pilots using text-based menus and the dialogue will reflect previous mission results. If the wingmate dies on a mission, their chair/locker/barstool will be unoccupied and their name crossed off on the killboard.[CR]Missions are launched from the briefing room, with a series of checkpoints to visit and objectives to accomplish. Mission types offer some variety between patrols, escort duty, attack runs and investigations. Missions frequently change from their original description en route as the player encounters enemy Kilrathi and is forced to make snap decisions to maintain the mission.[CR]The game used 2D sprites rendered out at various angles to simulate a 3D entity in a similar way that Doom would use later to represent its computer controlled enemies. Even this simulated 3D experience taxed computer systems of the time to their limits; when played on the standard Amiga home computer, the framerate would often dip well into single digits when space battles got frantic.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wing Commander: The Secret Missions is the first official expansion for the original Wing Commander, in which the player is a new pilot who helps the Terran Confederation defeat their enemies, the ruthless cat-like alien race known as the Kilrathi. In this installment, the TCS Tiger's Claw is sent out to destroy a Kilrathi secret super weapon that can obliterate entire worlds. The Tiger's Claw must follow the weapon deep into Kilrathi space to find the dreaded Sivar. The game also features new ships and an increase in difficulty.[CR]The Secret Missions was followed by a second expansion pack, also set between the events of Wing Commander and Wing Commander II: Vengeance of the Kilrathi. Wing Commander: The Secret Missions 2: Crusade is set in a region of space inhabited by a bird-like race the Firekkans who wish to fight the Kilrathi alongside the Terran Federation.[CR]As with the original game, Wing Commander: The Secret Missions was ported to the Super Nintendo. Rather than being an expansion pack, the game was released on the SNES as a standalone entry.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 5,5,5,5 and 5 out of ten. Mike Weigand wrote, "This is the second Wing Commander game for the SNES, and it falls short of the original. The scrolling and action is incredibly choppy plus gets very distracting. This was a good idea, but it just didn't turn out very well".[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Passwords[CR]On the main menu, select the second option, "Continue Campaign" and press start.

				<plot>The game takes place during World War 1. Choose one of the five allied fighter pilots to do battle against the Central Powers. The game consists of 20 missions with the final one culminating with a battle between the player and "The Red Baron".[CR]Missions are basically the same as in its' predecessor Wings. There are bombing missions where you have to take out targets that were circled in an aerial photograph, strafing runs where you get to blast anything that you fancy blasting with an unlimited supply of ammo, and of course the main part: dogfights in the sky.[CR]If a mission is completed successfully, the player can power up the successful pilot in four skill categories: flying, shooting, mechanics, and stamina. A failed mission can lead to either a dishonorable discharge or death for the pilot.</plot>

				<plot>Winter Olympics (Lillehammer 94 is added informally and is not part of the official title) is the official video game of the XVII Olympic Winter Games that were held in Lillehammer, Norway in 1994. Published by US Gold. Home computer versions (Amiga and PC) were developed by ID Software (not to be confused with id Software, of Doom fame) and console versions (GG, MD/Gen, Master System, Super NES) were developed by Tiertex. The game featured 10 winter sporting events. There are also major differences between platforms.[CR]Players can represent different countries from Canada to England to Brazil. However, the player does not have the luxury of accented letters to make authentic looking French or Portuguese names. It is impossible for the player to name his character "Pel?" because there is no "?" symbol in the game, so players will have to call him "Pele" instead.[CR]The player can train freely and compete in both full or mini (events selected by the player) Olympics. During competition, there are both medals and points tables. While in Olympic Gold points were awarded according to the medals table, in Winter Olympics they were given according to the best results, like decathlon. Doing so, it was perfectly possible to someone win the gold medal in short track, and get few more points than other skaters (even not finalists) that got better qualifying times. This scoring method also meant that someone who won gold medals in six or seven events might fall outside the top 10 if is disqualified on the remaining three.[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Olympics:_Lillehammer_94[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The Wizard of Oz for the SNES is a re-telling of L. Frank Baum's classic story as strongly influenced by MGM's 1939 musical.  To a lesser degree, individual levels adapt locations from the 1993 Wizard of Oz Animated Series by DIC by using settings from the series, such as Time Town.[CR]The game is a platform adventure, which highly encourages exploration.  The action is split into four worlds.  In each of the first three worlds, the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion can be found, while in the last rather than gain a companion the witch must be fought.  After gaining a companion, the characters may be switched on the fly, and each companion has significantly different attacks and abilities.  Several of the levels require using a combination of all of these abilities to fully explore. The game also includes a variety of mini-games which gives the player a chance to play as Toto also.[CR]All levels can be revisited once passed and doing so required both for the purposes of stocking up on items and to find the Emerald City tickets which are required to enter the final area.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Area Passwords[CR]After the title screen select continue and enter the following:</plot>

				<title_clean>Wizardry V - Heart of the Maelstrom</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wizardry V is a first-person, grid-based, RPG that stands as a wholly separate adventure without an arc associated with it. After assembling their party of adventurers, the player will confront many challenges and puzzles as they attempt to penetrate the dangers surrounding the so-called Heart of the Maelstrom stirring beneath a fantastic castle. It should not be confused with the Japanese version of the series which had long since spun off from the main franchise. It was published in October, 1992.[CR]As in all other Wizardry games, Wizardry V is played from a first person 3D perspective. It would be the last game in the series to feature wire-frame dungeon walls, text-only interface design, and static 2D monster portraits although the visuals would be significantly upgraded for its console release on the SNES. On PCs, however, the various game environments are primarily distinguished from each other by (often quite verbose) text descriptions. Similarly, text messages and non-interactive dialogue sequences are used to advance the plot.[CR]The relatively simple and clear interface is organized around a series of commands and actions listed at the bottom of the screen as well as a combined inventory and statistics screen. The original release of the game lacked mouse support but this was later added to subsequent versions.[CR]Wizardry V did not offer an import option for characters/parties created in the first four titles.[CR]Among the other features of the game were:Over 70 spells were available for casting4 basic classes to choose from and four elite classes to upgrade to5 races to create classes with[CR]The game did not have any copy protection and creating a Scenario Diskette was needed in order the game on. The CD-ROM version of the game automatically circumvented this by creating one on the drive when installed.[CR]The manual was also noteworthy for being written in a way that made Wizardry V appear appealing to newcomers with little to no experience with an RPG. Illustrated with humorous drawings and a great deal of detail worked into its text, it also outlined several key monsters/encounters that the party may discover on their trips into the Maze.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Long ages have passed within the Kingdom of Llylgamyn. The evil of Werdna is but legend, the secrets of the Knight of Diamonds long forgotten, and the Mad Overlord has become but a story to scare little children into doing what their parents say. The descendants of the legendary heroes of old have long since disappeared, but the Orb that they had recovered in their last and greatest adventure continues to provide knowledge to those that seek its wisdom. With its revelations on the secrets of life and magic, it spurred much debate and would found a new school of magic organized around what it had shared with those that dared to look into its depths. The Orb was handed to the Brotherhood of Llylgamym for safekeeping and peace reigned throughout the land.[CR]But things began to grow dark once more. Strange weather was the first sign, sickness the next. What was happening? People looked to the orb for help, fearing that it had lost its powers. The High Council was called together behind closed doors. Weeks passed, but with the use of powerful magic and the grace of both the ancient and new gods, they found what they were looking for.[CR]They discovered that the very fabric of reality was coming apart and that the source of this chaos was an unnatural, magical vortex located beneath the Brotherhood's Temple within a maze of caverns and tunnels. It was a place known as the Maelstrom. It had long been a home to foul beasts and the outcasts of the land and there, a great evil now festered threatening not only the land but the entire world. All that we knew may cease to exist if its growth isn't stopped.[CR]They sages of the High Council knew only one answer: to seek the help of a demi-god known as the Gatekeeper. Once a mortal, his power grew to a point where it soon became divine and had inherited the responsibility of watching over and maintaining the balance of magic and the natural world. He might be their only hope, assuming that he would listen to mortals.[CR]But the sages were confident that their call would be answered, so grave was the danger. However, to their utter horror, they learned that the Gatekeeper himself was held prisoner in the heart of the very vortex they wished him to destroy! Terrified, the Sages turned ot the Brotherhood whose knowledge of the mystical and magical exceeded their own. Here, a tale of evil and treachery was scried by Brother Drew, High Prophet of the Brotherhood.[CR]They learned of a renegade Brother, a woman named the Sorn, whose wish it is to end all order in the universe. She had discovered a means to create an ever-growing rift in reality...the very vortex that now threatens the land. From this destruction will come a new universe where chaos will reign and the world will no longer exist. It was she who trapped the Gatekeeper and made him prisoner. She must be stopped lest everyone perish in her madness.[CR]It has been three years since these events were discovered and the vortex continues to grow. Time is growing short. Two of the most powerful sages in the kingdom, Fontizan and the High Sage Yeldarb have begun to seek warriors brave enough to enter the caverns beneath the Temple of the Brotherhood, find the Gatekeeper, and free him from the vortex. However, they must first defeat the evil Sorn.[CR]In order to even have a chance, the adventurers must first seek out G'bli Gedook, the High Priest of the Brotherhood. He is the guardian of the Orb of Llylgamym and resides in the first layer of the caverns just under the temple. From there, they must descend into the depths of the Maze and battle whatever the Sorn can conjure up to stop them.[CR]After many battles and adventures, a party did achieve the impossible and confronted the Sorn deep below the Temple. By closing the Triaxial Gate which was the source of the rift and calling forth the Gatekeeper, they destroyed the shield that had protected the Sorn and its minions. In the battle that followed, the Sorn was ultimately defeated and the Triaxial Balance restored.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Wizardry V is a tile or grid based movement, first-person RPG set in a mysterious Castle that serves as the base for party management and the Maze in which the adventure takes place. Party size is limited to six members, although smaller parties are even allowed but not suggested for survival. The player must find penetrate the dangers and mysteries of the Maze in order to stop the nefarious Sorn dwelling within the Heart of the Maelstrom. But, in order to do, the party must also negotiate the Maze and deal with its dangerous inhabitants as well as solve the puzzles that stand in their way.[CR]The Maze comprises the central theater for the adventure and is comprised of several levels, each with its own distinct dangers and puzzles to solve. The lack of an automap (which had yet to become a standard feature of RPGs at the time of W6's release) means that the player is required to draw his or her own maps or otherwise rely on unofficial game guides and walkthroughs in order to navigate the mazelike multi-level dungeon.[CR]Saves could only be made anywhere, but Wizardry V's setup on PCs had an additional side-benefit to doing so. It would allow players to quick-save their progress and quit out of the scenario and if they chose to start at the Castle with a fresh party, they could wander back into the Maze and even encounter their old party where they had left them.[CR]Levels were earned after gaining the requisite experience as well as resting at the Inn back at the Castle. It was possible to continue adventuring well after the previous experience limit was met and earning several levels at once after a restful stay at the Inn.The Castle[CR]This was the central location for the player's management options concerning their party. Here, several locations were available by hotkey:Gilgamesh's Tavern - A dim and smoke filled place with a perpetual haunch of boar roasting over the fire, small groups of adventurers congregate here discussing their latest exploits or hoping to join a party. This is where the player will build their party from characters they create.Adventurer's Inn - Rest is offered as long as the party can afford their stay. Several different rooms are provided ranging from the Stables to a Royal Suite, each with their own rate of healing. This is also where resting characters can level up once they have the requisite experience.Temple of Cant - More severe ailments are handled here, again for the right 'donation'. Paralysis, poison, and even the dead can be brought back to a sense of normalcy after enough coins are shared with the faithful. Boltac's Trading Post - A friendly dwarf named Boltac operates this in the Castle's market area, providing his services to anyone that can afford them. Arms, goods, and even his experience in identifying certain items can all be purchased with the right coin. The party can even sell their ill gotten gains here to free up their pockets for even more loot that they might come across. Boltac can even remove cursed items, although the party will also lose the item once it's "uncursed."Edge of Town - From here, the party can visit the Training Grounds, enter the Maze, or head back to the Castle.The Maze - Many adventurers seeking fame, glory, and experience eagerly dive into the dangers of the Maze. Other adventurers, monsters, and even a few riddles await them here as they head ever deeper into the depths in search of evil.Training Grounds - New characters are created here and players can also inspect older characters to see if they need a few changes of their own.Character Interaction[CR]Not every monster wants to stick the party's heads on a pike and some might even be very helpful. When these NPCs (non-player characters) are encountered, the party have several options that they can explore. They can talk to them which brings up a text parser for inquiries to made with, similar to that found in interactive fiction.[CR]The player can also barter with them if they have anything to sell, or if they want to buy something from the party. The party can also opt to give them something for free in order to get onto their good side. Stealing is also another option and a charm spell can also be cast to help them see the party in a better light. Or, if the player wants, they can just opt to fight and kill whoever they had been having a nice conversation with. The player just needs be sure they can live with the consequences, or have enough coin to resurrect them with once they've had their fun.Puzzles[CR]Wizardry V's puzzles were focused primarily around riddles and items that were needed to get by certain obstacles. Most notable was its maze-like dungeon with many random encounters thrown in for good measure.[CR]Picking Locks and Disarming Traps[CR]Picking locks was as simple as having a Thief (or a mage with the proper spell) in the party to do so depending on their expertise. Disarming traps, especially on treasure chests, was much more different. A character with the proper skill could inspect the chest and determine what kind of trap was on it. Once they made their assessment, it was up to the player to disarm the trap by opting to do so and then typing the trap's name in. If they are correct, the trap is disarmed.Camping[CR]This command allowed the party to camp out in the middle of the dungeon. This also enabled the player to inspect their party members and also re-order their party's marching order. This also allows the player to equip their entire party at once if they so choose.Swimming[CR]There are magical pools that the party can dive into in order to discover anything of worth within their depths. Characters will learn the art of swimming over time and with enough experience in diving into pools.[CR]Special Monsters[CR]Wizardy V also came with a pamphlet outlining several special encounters within the Maze complete with illustrations showing what they looked like. These NPCs could provide the player with clues, special items, or simply challenge the party with death.IronoseHe operates the local Maze Mart. He can be found bartering his goods, buying others gems, and battling an adventurer or two on the first level of the Maelstrom. He boasts "The Best Dungeon Prices" and comes in handy to adventurers in need. He determined that there was a place for a "Shop" in the Maze and that's where it first began. Business was slow at first, he only sold a few potions to Ice Phantoms and weapons to fighters, but gradually through word of mouth and an intense grafitti effort, business picked up. He's a well trained fighter, but friendly. After all, the customer is always right (well, most of the time!).The Laughing KettleBelieve it or not, there's actually a land where Kettles roam freely (if that's what Kettles do), the motherland of Fymia. It is the origin of The Laughing Kettle.Back in his homeland, he was well-educated, respected and loved. However, tension eventually grew as the Kettle began to spout information no one understood time after time. His one-time friends talked behind his back; "He thinks he knows it all!" Actually, the Kettle was only trying to help them. The taunting continued, and he decided he had heard enough. It was time to leave this blessed soil to head for the Maelstrom... with a bang. And a bang it was! Granted, it wasn't the right thing to do. No one remained. He laughs today at this event, and likely will laugh tomorrow.The Kettle has been around the Maelstrom for years, and despite his laughter, his wisdom is great. He's still your everyday "know-it-all." Manfretti's "Adventure getting you down? Combat's just not going as well as you had planned? Come to Manfretti's, the fun center of the Maelstrom." That's what the graffiti said. But there is more to Manfretti's, both in fun and in lore, than meets the eye.There you'll find things to delight your senses, thrill your spirit, and warm your heart. It was all created for you by the magical Manfretti, a man who had a love for life and a first-rate sense of humor. He realized that once in awhile even the best needed a break, and so he and a group of his female associates carved from the rock within the Maze until he had created room for his fun center. It took the Manfretti and the five women years of work. When they finished, Manfretti smiled at their achievements and planned for more.Saying good-bye to the ladies, off he went in search of more "fun things to do." Time went by, but he never returned, and to this day, Manfretti's whereabouts are unknown. Yet the ladies he left behind continue on his dream; they keep the fun center alive, all the while hoping for his return. When you visit, and I am sure you will, you may meet one of them, and you should meet all. Ye Dragon's Flagon [CR]If only these walls could talk, what a story they would tell. From far and near, the weary, dwarf fighters who inhabit the Maze come to the Dragon's Flagon in search of the three R's: rest, relaxation and rye.[CR]It's truly an interesting place. Somehow those little fingers have managed to disguise the bar. You won't find it... ever; it's their private reserve (with all profits channelled back to the five dwarfs in the Flagon's membership, of course). It was established in 674 b.m. (before Maelstrom) to honor the much beloved and huge Dragon of Bhjimo, who carried her likewise huge flagon everywhere. After her death at the hand of Yetteje, a robust samurai, the dwarf fighters dragged the flagon to its current, undisclosed location.[CR]Should you happen upon this place, you can almost always find one of the dwarfs willing to talk if you've got the ear to listen. They have been around the maze, and might be able to offer something of value. But occasionally, adventure calls the dwarf fighters, so be prepared to make several return visits.[CR]The Togo Llama No one can pass up a gaze at this breathtaking creature. Imagine a llama in a toga. It's not an everyday sight, nor is this an everyday animal.[CR]Many, many years ago a clan of llamas roamed the plains of Lytricidickydo. The plains were sizzling hot, but the llamas had adapted to this environment fairly well. Then one day an adventurer by the name of Nalla Orman came along, bartering his goods.[CR]"I have here the most wondeful item. It's something you need to stop that blasted heat. I'll sell you this exclusive designer toga for only 5000 gold pieces. You won't find another one like it anywhere!"[CR]And so he went on... and on... and on. Eventually the llamas bought his story and his togas. Whether they did it just to shut him up, no one knows. Nonetheless, they followed him back to the Castle and into the dungeons where the air was cool and the living was easy. Hence is the story of the Toga Llama.[CR]The Ruby WarlockThe lore of the Ruby Warlock goes back quite a ways. It seems he's been around forever. In his younger years, he was quite a gem. He practiced spells every day, and looked forward to the time when he, like those before him, could walk the lower levels proud and unafraid. However, the spirits got him. Bottled spirits, that is. He can be seen asking passers-by for a sip. Of course, the creatures of the Maze look upon The Ruby Warlock with pity, and help him when they can. He's not really a bad fellow, just a Warlock who fell by the wayside.He still remains a fairly laid-back individual, unless provoked. As "Warlock" would imply, he is chock-full of magical power! So take care in your words and your actions.The Ghosts' Nest So you've never seen a ghost. You will likely see one of yourself if you're not careful. Yes, this is the legendary Ghosts' Nest, home to those who have refused to accept the fact that... well... they are dead.The whereabouts of this dwelling are unknown, even to me. But I have been told on more than one occasion that it is not a place for the meek. Even the strongest, they say, will perish underneath the vapory fingers of its inhabitants. Unfortunately, it's likely that there is a ghost on duty at all times, so a "pleasure stroll" is out of the question.I found once an old scroll in the dust of the Maze; I know not why I tell you. It may be of no matter. The parchment was badly soiled, and the words were nearly gone. I could decipher part of its tale: "Death awaits, gold comes, terror abounds... from the three, straight to thee..." The Den of Thieves Banned from virtually every corner of the Maelstrom is the troop of bandits who shelter at the Den of Thieves. The poor souls are misunderstood outcasts in their own Maze. They're really a nice crew (as long as you keep your stuff secure). However, they are a bit hard to find.Throughout the years they've managed to assemble a lot of items stolen from various, fool-hearty adventurers. Swords, shields, bows, potions... you name it. Naturally, in order to protect themselves, they needed a good hiding spot. Three of the thieves were certain that a room deep within the caverns would be the perfect spot. However, another member of their guild reminded the ambitious members that monsters (and he meant monsters) lived in those depths. Finally, the wisest of them all announced his plan to the agreement of the rest. The Den was to be established in an area where no light shown. It was hoped you would never find the door.Try, hard, adventurer! For as they pick your pockets, you can pick their minds. As sneaky as they are, a word or two not meant for their ears may have been heard. Check in on them often for the latest gossip. The Hurkle Beast [CR]Lurking and stalking, working and talking are the traits of the infamous Hurkle Beast. He is the last of the Hurkeniskon species, all of whom "hurkle" often. If you should hear the chant while traversing the caverns, it's likely this chap is nearby.[CR]A few brave adventures of times past captured the Hurkle Beast and encaged him in a box. None thought his escape was possible. However, the box proved too weak for the creature, and his breakout was natural. In tatters, the cage still remains, but the Hurkle Beast roams free.[CR]Unfortunately, the Hurkle Beast can't figure out how to leave the area to return to his homeland, Hurkazownia. So, here he remains.[CR]The SnatchThe Snatch is a crafty little thief who hangs out at Manfretti's. As with most thieves, The Snatch has overheard many conversations. And, like those in his profession, he can't keep a secret very well.[CR]The Snatch began his career rather slowly, but then inspiration struck. He applied for membership at the Den of Thieves. Virtually a novice in his profession, he hoped that the members would teach him a thing or two. If not, he'd simply take it. Within two weeks, his application had been unanimously DENIED. He passed none of the stealing tests and got caught three times attempting to steal information. Yet, he passed the important tests; that is, those tests important to The Snatch! He stole "The Thieves Handbook" from the Den, the member's ideas and their trade secrets to boot. He never wanted membership; he only wanted all they had to give.[CR]GwylionThey never intended to be the way they are. Not so long ago, they were friendly, light-hearted individuals. Now, they roam the Maze, bent on the revenge of an unknown cause. Everyone who greets them is subjected to attack and only rarely will they offer the party a truce.[CR]The story of their transformation is unknown, but the Gwylion's change occurred shortly after it was declared that Manfretti was missing. Some speculate that the girls loved Manfretti; others, such as I, believe it was jealousy of those who enjoyed his company. When Manfretti was around, they would listen to his jokes and stories for hours on end. After his disappearance, their visits lessened, and gradually ended. They may still search for him today.[CR]Feel sorrow for these poor beasts, but not enough to render yourself open to their attacks. Surely, they will show you no mercy. [CR]Character Development[CR]The player can opt to start with the batch of pre-made character provided for them by the game or create their own.Age[CR]Characters can actually age in Wizardry V if they rest too much. Resting at the Inn can last anywhere from a single day to a year depending on how much gold the player has in reserve. Resting replenishes a party's health and stamina, readying them for the road ahead, but rest enough times and a character will start to age. But when they first start out in the game, they are at an extremely young age. Death by old age is hardly expected, but it is a possibility.Classes[CR]The character classes belong to one of two categories; Base or Elite. Base classes (Fighter, Mage, Priest, Thief) are often considered the 'starting' class for a character whereas Elite classes (Lord, Bishop, Samurai, Lord, Ninja) typically benefit from having better fighting skills and eventual proficiency in magic. The initial statistics requirements for Elite classes are noticably higher than for the Base classes, making the former much more difficult to create at the start of the game.[CR]As with quite a few RPGs, Wizardry V includes the option to change character class during the course of the game at the Training Grounds when inspecting a character. The incentives to do so in Wizardry V are comparatively strong as many abilities are retained from the original classes, and since characters who recently changed classes during mid-game can often gain levels rapidly (thus enabling the player to raise skill points and fill out spell books much faster than would otherwise have been possibly).[CR]Alignment largely determines what kind of class a particular character can be.[CR]The four basic classes are:Fighter - High hit points and experts at using any weapon and piece of armor, they are a grounded class that can dish out the damage as well as take it.Thief - No party is complete without a thief who can pick locks and disarm traps. While they aren't the greatest of fighters, they rely on their sneakiness to backstab their enemies.Priest - Long known as skilled healers, their talents are important for any party heading out into danger. They can also dispel the undead. They cannot be of neutral alignment.Mage - The classic wizard. As they become more powerful, their spellbooks will continue to add many new pages filled with deadly spells. [CR]The four elite classes are: Bishop - Like a Priest, they are able to heal their friends and dispel the undead. They are also able to uncurse items that become permanently stuck to a character, freeing them. They can also learn any spell from any of the other schools. The downside is that their learning rate is also a bit slower, so the selection of spells that they may have will take more time to develop. But with their uncurse ability, they're nigh indispensible. They must not be neutral.Samurai - A true swordsman. At the fourth level of experience, they begin to learn Mage spells. They cannot be of evil alignment because of their adherence to the code of Bushido.Lord - Skilled as a fighter as well as being pious enough to cast a few spells, they are likened to paladins and crusader knights. They start learning priestly spells around the fourth level of experience. They can also only be of good alignment.Ninja - An assassin and a rogue, they can kill with weapons or their bare hands, sometimes being able to kill the strongest enemy with a single blow. They disdain armor and become far harder to hit and tougher to kill as they gain levels. They also have all of the skills of thief and are able to disarm traps. They can also hide in shadows and ambush enemies. They must also be of evil alignment.Races[CR]The races include familiar fantasy characters such as the Elf, the Dwarf, the Gnome and the Hobbit.Humans - Balanced without any serious flaws, a good, even keeled race that can belong and excel at any profession.Elf - They excel at the intellectual classes, such as Mages, or Bishops. Keenly interested in study.Dwarf - Gruff, short in stature, but tough and reliable, dwarves make excellent Fighters while their piety can also find them a career as a Priest.Gnomes - Found underground and often overlooked by the larger races, their quiet and studious nature make them ideal as Mages or Priests.Hobbit - Friendly, nimble, and otherwise unassuming, they make surprisingly decent Ninja, Samurai, or Thieves.Statistics[CR]Attribute scores had a maximum value of 18 and determined a variety of effects and class eligibility requirements. Many of these attributes were particularly important across many classes across a variety of skills. Characters can improve their attributes thanks to the investment of points earned with every level.Strength - Determines how much damage a character can lay into a monster as well as how much weight they can carry around with them. It also affects certain weapon skills and plays into staminaI.Q. - Important for spellcasters.Piety - This is important for a character's ability to concentrate on the task at hand. It also affects how many spells a character may be able to learn and their effectiveness with them.Vitality - Very important for hit points, the chance for resurrection, the ability to resist damage and disease, and general health.Luck - Ambiguous but it also has mysterious effects on many other factors[CR]As with many RPGs, character development was driven by experience points which translated into levels. When a character gains a level after resting an an inn:Spellcasters may be able to learn a new spellDepending on their statistics, a character may even change their classHit points will also improve[CR]Combat[CR]Combat in Wizardry V was a turn based affair with random encounters providing the cannon fodder that would feed the party's thirst for experience points. When enemies encountered the party, a list of enemies along with a picture showing what they were onscreen.[CR]Similar to other RPGs of the era, its strict turn-based system halts the passage of time until the player performs an action (such as moving around or casting spells). In combat, the order in which characters act is determined primarily by their speed statistics, although the player issues orders to every character in the party before commencing a turn. Besides using melee and/or ranged weapons and casting spells, characters with the appropriate skills can hide (which means enemies cannot hurt them), use items in their inventory, equip new weapons or items or try to run away from battle which, if successful, results in the entire party fleeing from the enemies. It is not possible to save the game or restore a saved game while in combat mode, but there are no other restrictions on when and where the player can save the game.[CR]In each round of combat, everyone makes their selection of actions as the game calculates who will have initiative and then executing their orders. When several groups of monsters are encountered, the player is able to pick out who the targets are from the generated list shown onscreen.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The FM Towns version featured enhanced CD quality music.By this point, the Wizardry series was so popular in Japan, an anime spin-off was created.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] View Graphics and Sound Test[CR]After you finish the game, your characters will get an "@" next to their name. Now, anytime you reset the game, hold either B, Y, Select or Start at the copyright screen until the Capcom logo disappears. A screen that lets you look at the game's graphics will appear.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Have both good and evil characters in the same party.[CR]Normally, good and evil characters will not travel together (i.e. you can't select both from Gilgamesh's Tavern) But, here's how you can get them both in one party. Take all the evil (or good) characters that you want, bring them out into the maze, and quit the party. Then, bring the characters of the opposite alignment out, and do a character search where you quit the first party, you can then have them join, and travel together.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wolfchild is a 2D shooter/platformer from British developers Core Design, which would later go on to create the Tomb Raider franchise. It features Saul Morrow, a man who is able to transform into a powerful werewolf form in order to fight the evil Chimera organization who kidnapped his scientist father Kal, from whom he received his powers. The game is a standard 2D platformer with shooting elements, and the player must collect energy before they can transform similar to Altered Beast.[CR]Wolfchild was originally released on the home computers Amiga and Atari ST, before being ported to various consoles like the Genesis, Master System, Mega-CD, SNES and Game Gear.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the SNES version was released Mike Weigand of Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the score of 5 out of 10. He wrote, "...It's got great graphics, and some of the sound effects are dynamite, but Wolfchild loses big in the gameplay department. The punching and other attacks are awkward. This was a new idea, and the levels are huge, but the overall game is dull and rather unappealing".[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR]At the title screen, press Y, A, B, B, A, Down, A, B, B, A.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wolfenstein 3D (often stylized as Wolfenstein 3-D) is a first-person shooter developed by id and released by Apogee (via shareware and mail order) on May 5, 1992 for the PC (running MS-DOS).Loosely inspired by the Castle Wolfenstein series of stealth action games, the game is often cited as the progenitor of the modern first-person shooter genre.Set in World War II, players control Captain William "B.J." Blazkowicz, an Allied spy imprisoned by the Nazi regime while attempting to uncover the plans of the mysterious "Operation Eisenfaust". After overpowering a guard and stealing his Luger P08, B.J. must traverse the depths of the fortified stronghold (known as Castle Wolfenstein) and find a way to escape. The subsequent episodes in the trilogy deal with B.J.'s pursuit against Operation Eisenfaust (which turned out to be the creation of undead Nazi mutants) and B.J.'s infiltration into the bunker of Adolf Hitler.The game was originally released in a three-episode trilogy, with the first episode (dealing with the escape from Castle Wolfenstein) as the widely-released shareware episode. A deluxe add-on could have been bought (either separately or bundled with the original trilogy) that added three more episodes (known as "The Nocturnal Missions"), which serve as the game's prequel (as B.J. must investigate Nazi plans for chemical warfare). Commercial versions of the game (released throughout the years by GT Interactive, Activision, Apogee, and id) contained all six episodes.Over the years, the original MS-DOS game has been ported to a variety of platforms. Early ports (in which major graphical and gameplay differences are common) include the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the Atari Jaguar, Macintosh computers, the Acorn Archimedes, the 3DO, the Apple IIgs, and the NEC PC-9801. Later ports (near-identical to the original game) were released for the Game Boy Advance, Xbox 360 (via Xbox Live Arcade), PlayStation 3 (via PlayStation Network), Steam (using DOSBox), and all iOS devices. To commemorate the game's 20th anniversary, Bethesda released a browser-based version of the game (including only the original trilogy). Due to the release of the game's source code in 1995 (a practice id would continue with its later games), various unofficial modifications had been created and various ports have been made for additional platforms (including Linux computers, the Dreamcast, and the Sega 32X).Due to the extensive references to Nazism (including graphics depicting swastikas and the title screen theme depicting the anthem of the Nazi party), the game is in violation of German criminal code and is banned in Germany. Some versions (namely the Super Nintendo Entertainment System version) removed the references while censoring the game's violence (for instance, removing blood and changing attack dogs to mutant rats). Some later ports (namely the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions) removed references to the Red Cross (replacing the "red cross" of medical items with a heart symbol).Wolfenstein 3D was followed by a standalone expansion (and prequel) in 1992, titled Spear of Destiny. id has, since then, been a co-developer with several reboots of the Wolfenstein franchise, including 2001's Return to Castle Wolfenstein, 2008's Wolfenstein RPG, and 2009's Wolfenstein.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The objective of Wolfenstein 3D is simply to navigate a variety of maze-like three-dimensional levels, with the ultimate goal being to find the designated exit point, thereby transporting the player to the next level in the sequence. Along the way, the player must engage in first-person firefights with a variety of opponents in order to ensure their survival, all the while keeping an eye out for new weapons and pickups that restore ammo and health so as to tip the odds in their favour. Many levels incorporate locked doors, which may only be opened once the player has located and picked up the associated Key (either Silver or Gold), and exploration is also encouraged, as secret areas are found in abundance throughout the game. These hidden zones are more often than not tremendously helpful, being filled with health pickups, ammo, weaponry, or in rare cases revealing the entrance to a secret level. The game consists of six episodes comprised of ten levels each, with all episodes culminating in a climactic boss fight. After each level the player is taken to a summary screen where they are rated according to various metrics, including kill count and the percentage of treasures and secrets found in the level.The game includes a number of arcade-like elements, including lives and a scoring system, with points awarded for kills and collecting treasures within levels. The player begins each episode with only three lives, but can be awarded additional lives for every 40,000 points they amass, or for finding 1-Ups, up to a potential maximum of nine lives. Upon death, the player returns to the beginning of the current level with only their starting weapons, the Knife and Pistol, and must replay it from scratch. If the player loses all of their lives, they cannot continue at all, and must instead start from the beginning of the episode with three lives. These systems are somewhat trivialized by Wolfenstein 3D's save game system, however, which allows the player to save the game at any point and reload that save without restrictions. Thus, players are essentially able to use this system to restart an infinite number of times while also minimizing many of the normal penalties associated with death, such as lost progress and stripped weaponry.[CR]Episodes[CR]In Wolfenstein 3D, each episode consists of ten floors (one of which is a secret floor, accessible only by finding a secret elevator exit in a specific level of the episode). In the ninth and final floor, players must face a formidable foe (the episode's "boss") in order to proceed.The Original TrilogyThe first episode, "Escape from Wolfenstein", served as the game's shareware episode, with the remaining two episodes available in mail-order. Commercial versions of the game included all three episodes (as well as The Nocturnal Missions below).Episode 1: "Escape from Wolfenstein" - Sent in on a reconnaissance mission to find plans detailing Operation Eisenfaust, B.J. is captured and imprisoned in the depths of Castle Wolfenstein. After overpowering a guard in his cell and taking his pistol, Blazkowicz must escape from the fortified stronghold to continue his mission. Chief among his concerns is Hans Grosse, the fearsome head guard stationed at Castle Wolfenstein.Episode 2: "Operation: Eisenfaust" - After escaping from Castle Wolfenstein, B.J. continues to investigate reports of Operation: Eisenfaust, only to find out that the Nazis are creating an army of undead mutants deep within Castle Hollehammer. B.J. must now fight his way through hordes of the zombified Nazi soldiers (alongside normal guards) and stop the plan at its source (by eliminating the demented head scientist, Dr. Schabbs).Episode 3: "Die, F&#252;hrer, Die!" - After the downfall of Operation: Eisenfaust, B.J. is sent to infiltrate a heavily fortified underground Nazi bunker deep under the Reichstag, where he must find and eliminate the head of the entire Nazi regime: Adolf Hitler.The Nocturnal MissionsFormerly an add-on trilogy to complement the original game, The Nocturnal Missions serve as a prequel to B.J.'s imprisonment at Castle Wolfenstein. All commercial versions of the game include the trilogy.Episode 4: "A Dark Secret" - Intelligence has uncovered a horrifying Nazi plot to begin large-scale chemical warfare against Allied armies, tied to a chemical weapons manufacturer. B.J. must infiltrate the weapons research facility and hunt down the manufacturer: Dr. Otto Giftmacher.Episode 5: "Trail of the Madman" - With Giftmacher dead and the Nazi supply of chemical weaponry cut off, B.J. must now pursue General Fettgesicht, the man in charge of the Nazis' chemical warfare initiative, as the chemical bombardment has already commenced. Traveling deep within Castle Erlangen, B.J. must find documents which detail the specifics of the coming "Giftkrieg" (Poison War) and discover the location of General Fettgesicht. However, these documents are heavily guarded by soldiers led by fearsome head guard Gretel Grosse.Episode 6: "Confrontation" - After recovering the "Giftkrieg" plans, B.J. determines General Fettgesicht's location: Castle Offenbach. To ensure that the Nazi's chemical warfare is well and truly defeated, B.J. travels to Offenbach personally in order to assassinate Fettgesicht.[CR][B]Weapons:[/B][CR]The original PC release of Wolfenstein 3D features four weapons: a knife, a pistol, and two automatic weapons. All three of the game's ranged weapons are hitscan, and all three of them use the same ammunition (vaguely referred to as "bullets") with the only difference between them being rate of fire. This makes it very important to monitor ammunition levels and refrain from being too trigger-happy (especially with the ammo-eating Chaingun), since running out of bullets renders the player unable to use any firearms (forcing them into the unenviable position of having to attack ranged opponents with only their knife).All normal hitscan weapons deal a random amount of damage per shot from 0 HP to 16 HP. Close-ranged attacks deal 4x the amount of damage, while long-ranged attacks have a chance to miss (proportional to the distance away from the player). Attacking an enemy when they do not notice the player further doubles the damage for the initial shot.Original WeaponsKnifeKnife[CR]One of the player's two starting weapons, the Knife is the only melee weapon in the game (and the last case scenario after running out of ammo).[CR]Because of its reliance on close-quarters, slow stabbing speed, and low damage output (anywhere from 0 HP to 16 HP a stab), attacking most enemies with the knife is very risky (as gun-wielding enemies can deal greater damage in any range). It can be very useful against Dogs, however, as they die to a single stab.PistolPistol[CR]One of the player's two starting weapons, the Pistol is semi-automatic (requiring players to press the Fire button for each shot). Due to its slow rate-of-fire, it is easily surpassed by the Machine Gun once it is acquired.Machine GunMachine Gun[CR]Not too difficult to find throughout each floor (especially since it can be retrieved by a fallen SS Officer), the Machine Gun surpasses the Pistol in its rate-of-fire (allowing the player to fire away by holding down the Fire button).[CR]Despite being fully-automatic, its steady firing rate allows for easier ammo conservation (in comparison to the ammo-eating Chain Gun below) while being formidable against all but the toughest of enemies.Chain GunChain Gun[CR]The very pinnacle of Wolfenstein 3D's ballistic arsenal, the Chain Gun unleashes a torrent of bullets at anything directly in front of the player with double the firing rate of the Machine Gun.[CR]While it can take out any modest threat in short order, it can be wasteful as it burns through the player's ammunition at an extremely rapid pace. Despite this flaw, it is useful both against very dangerous groups of enemies and against bosses.Port WeaponsFlamethrowerFlamethrower[CR]The first projectile weapon of the game (added in most ports), the Flamethrower fires a continuous stream of fire as the Fire button is held down. These clouds of ember can travel through enemies (allowing multiple targets to be hit by each projectile) in a straight line until it reaches a wall. Like the Chain Gun, it has a very high rate-of-fire.[CR]Unlike most games with flamethrowers, this version contains no splash damage (making it safe for the player to use recklessly, but not making it more effective against wide groups of enemies) and no continual burn damage.[CR]Unlike the original weapons, the Flamethrower has its own ammo source, Fuel, which can only be acquired by picking up Fuel Cans. Since enemies do not drop Fuel Cans, ammunition is more scarce.Rocket LauncherRocket Launcher[CR]The last projectile weapon of the game (added in most ports), the Rocket Launcher fires a powerful missile that can shred through most enemies before hitting a wall (or tougher enemy) and exploding.[CR]Unlike most games with rocket launchers, this version contains no splash damage (making it safe for the player to use recklessly, but not making it more effective against wide groups of enemies) and no additional explosion damage.[CR]Unlike the original weapons, the Rocket Launcher has its own ammo source, Rockets, which can only be acquired by Rocket Boxes. Since enemies do not drop Rocket Boxes, ammunition is more scarce.[CR]Items[CR]The four primary item types in the game are health restoratives, ammunition, treasure, and keys. Any potential benefits an item might bestow are immediately activated upon pickup, and the item itself is consumed; the exceptions to this rule are Gold and Silver Keys, which remain on the player's person (signified by icons in the status bar) in order to be used on locked doors later on in the level (and are inexplicably removed from the player's inventory upon starting a new level). Players cannot pick up any health items once they reach maximum health capacity (100%) and cannot pick up any ammo items once they reach maximum ammo capacity (99 bullets).HealthBlood Pile  Blood Pile[CR]If the player is reduced to 10% or less health, each random pile of blood restores 1% of the player's health.[CR]Unavailable in the SNES, Jaguar, Mac, and 3DO ports.Dog FoodDog Food[CR]Found near areas with groups of dogs, each single bowl of dog food restores 4% of the player's health.[CR]As dogs are replaced with large mutant rats in the SNES port, bowls of dog food are also replaced by cheese.FoodFood[CR]The most common health pickup in the game, each single plate of food restores 10% of the player's health.MedkitMedkit[CR]Found in low quantities, each first aid kit restores 25% of the player's health.1-Up1-Up[CR]Only found in hidden areas, each 1-Up ball restores the player to maximum health while granting both an extra life and 25 bullets. 1-Ups also count towards the end-of-level Treasure total.[CR]In the SNES, Mac, and 3DO ports, 1-Ups do not give any bullets. In the Jaguar port, 1-Ups only restores the player to 200% health.Treasures[CR]Picking up a single piece of treasure in the original version of the game increases the player's score by a certain amount (from 100-5000 points). This is useful for gaining extra lives, as they are found in abundance in special treasure rooms and secret areas.[CR]In the SNES, Mac, and 3DO versions of the game, treasure does not add to the player score. Instead, all pieces of treasure increase a special Item counter by one. When the Item counter reaches 50, it resets and the player is given an extra life.[CR]In the Jaguar version of the game, all pieces of treasure instead give the player 4% additional health. Unlike other health pickups (other than the 1-Up), the player's health can increase beyond 100% by picking up additional treasures (up to around 200%).CrossCross[CR]Each cross adds 100 points to the player's score.[CR]Due to Nintendo of America's censorship of religious iconography for their consoles, the SNES port replaces Crosses with large scepters.ChaliceChalice Each golden chalice adds 500 points to the player's score.ChestChest Each treasure chest adds 1000 points to the player's score.CrownCrown Each crown adds 5000 points to the player's score.MiscellaneousSilver &amp; Gold KeysSilver / Gold Keys[CR]Both silver and gold keys are required to unlock certain doors, which are usually required to reach the exit in each floor. While they are usually located at fixed points within the floor, the Grosse bodyguards also carry a key. All keys are discarded once the player exits a floor.Ammo ClipAmmo Clip[CR]Each clip of ammunition found throughout the environment grants the player eight bullets. Clips of ammunition dropped by killing most enemies, however, give only four bullets.[CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]With very few exceptions, enemies in Wolfenstein 3D are typified by hitscan weaponry, and the potential damage they mete out is based on how close the player is to them when they fire. Due to this mechanic, it is almost always preferable to keep one's distance from foes, as this directly limits how much damage attackers can do (though a similar damage scaling is applied to the player's weapons also). In the original PC release, all normal enemies are composed of eight-sided sprites, while bosses are one-sided sprites that face the player at all times. Many ported versions of Wolfenstein 3D convert normal enemies into one-sided sprites as well, which is far from a simple cosmetic change, as the original game allows the player to sneak up on or bypass many unalerted enemies. Without the additional enemy graphics, this mechanic is simply not present in some version of the game.Standard EnemiesGerman ShepherdGerman Shepherd DogHit Points: 1Point Value: 200 The German Shepherd Dog, or Dog, for short, is perhaps the least intimidating of Wolfenstein 3D's enemies, as it can attack only from melee range and has but a single hit point. The latter fact means that a single hit from any weapon is guaranteed to kill it, while the absence of a ranged attack makes it one of the few foes that can safely be handled with the Knife. It is one of the faster enemies in the game, and is capable of quickly closing the gap between itself and the player, which is particularly dangerous if the player is not yet aware of its presence. Due to censorship, German Shepherds were removed and replaced with Mutated Rats (which behave in the same manner) for the SNES release, and Dog Food health pickups were replaced with Cheese.GuardGuardHit Points: 25Point Value: 100 One of the most prevalent of Wolfenstein 3D's enemy types, Guards inhabit many of the game's levels in fairly large quantities. They have modest hit points, and fire at a fairly slow rate, but nonetheless can be quite dangerous, especially if the player does not immediately notice them. The Knife has some efficacy against Guards, particularly if the player can sneak up one, as continuous jabs can often prevent the Guard from retaliating. Any ranged weapon can also make short work of a Guard, though automatic weaponry is more favorable in instances where Guards appear en masse or with other more dangerous foes. Guards drop Ammo Clips with four bullets upon death.SS OfficerSS OfficerHit Points: 100Point Value: 500 The SS, or Schutzstaffel, are significantly tougher and more deadly than the regular Guards, with fully automatic Machine Guns and four times the hit points. They are introduced fairly early on, and remain one of the most dangerous opponents throughout the entire game. Failing to notice a nearby SS Officer spells certain death for the player more often than not, and when in the presence of other enemies, they are usually the most pressing concern. Due to their high health and rapid rate of fire, fighting a single SS Officer with a Pistol can be a dicey proposition, and fighting multiple SSes head-on without an automatic weapon can be disastrous. Thankfully, all SS Officers drop Machine Guns upon death. The SS also make a cameo appearance in Doom II: Hell on Earth, which contains two secret levels based on the first and last maps of Escape from Wolfenstein.MutantMutantHit Points: 45 (Skill 1), 55 (Skill 2 &amp; 3), 65 (Skill 4)Point Value: 700 The ghastly Mutants are the twisted undead creations of Dr. Schabbs, consisting of reanimated corpses with large semi-automatic rifles protruding directly out of their chests. Ludicrously, they must pup their arms up and down in order to chamber and fire rounds from these rifles. In terms of threat level, Mutants exist somewhere between the standard Guard and the SS Officer, with improvements in regard to hit point totals and firing rate over the former, but slight degradation in both categories when compared to the latter. Unlike most foes, the Mutant has no "wake up" sound upon being alerted, and this silent activation makes it much more likely that it will be able to sneak up on an unsuspecting player. After being defeated, the Mutant drops an ammo clip with four rounds.OfficerOfficerHit Points: 50Point Value: 400 The Officer looks much like a normal Guard clad in a white uniform, a similarity which is further reinforced by his fondness for the Pistol. The main differentiator between the two is the Officer's speed. They are the fastest ranged attack unit in that game, and the second fastest overall (behind the German Shepherd). This quickness not only applies to their foot speed, but also how fast they are on the draw. Officers will fire their weapons with far less hesitation than Guards, and can close the distance to lethal range in surprisingly little time. They are, however, only moderately equipped in terms of hit points, and will fall fairly quickly to most weapons, yielding 4 bullets in the process.Hitler GhostHitler GhostHit Points: 200 (Skill 1), 300 (Skill 2), 400 (Skill 3), 500 (Skill 4)Point Value: 2000 A facsimile of the F&#252;hrer himself, the Hitler Ghost (also known as Robed Hitler or Fake Hitler) is an extremely rare foe found only in the final level of the third episode, where it appears several times. It can be thought of as a mini-boss of sorts, as it has greater hit points than any other standard foe, which scale upward depending on the difficulty setting. This floating opponent carries no traditional armaments, instead unleashing slow-moving balls of fire from a device visible on its mid-chest. It is the only recurring ranged enemy that favors projectiles over hitscan weaponry, and because of this fact, its attacks can actually be dodged if the player is far enough away to manoeuvre around its incoming fire.BossesHans GrosseHans GrosseHit Points: 850 (Skill 1), 950 (Skill 2), 1050 (Skill 3), 1200 (Skill 4)Point Value: 5000 As the end boss of the first episode of Wolfenstein 3D, and the final obstacle between B.J. Blazkowicz and freedom from imprisonment in the bowels of Castle Wolfenstein, Hans Grosse is exponentially more powerful than any previously-encountered foe. In a trend which repeats itself with later bosses, Hans Grosse is most easily dispatched with the Chain Gun, though with two of his own, it is not advisable to get closer than medium distance when fighting him. Hans has two relatives, Gretel and Trans, who appear respectively as bosses in the later releases of the Nocturnal Missions and Spear of Destiny; chronologically, though, Hans is actually last Grosse to be killed by the player character.Dr. SchabbsDr. SchabbsHit Points: 850 (Skill 1), 950 (Skill 2), 1550 (Skill 3), 2400 (Skill 4)Point Value: 5000 The twisted mind behind the creation of the Mutants, Dr. Schabbs was the primary target of the player character prior to his capture by the Nazis. After escaping his prison in the first episode, B.J. continues in his quest to track down the evil doctor, eventually confronting him in the final mission of Episode Two. Schabbs attacks in an unorthodox manner by hurling loaded syringes at the player. Presumably, these needles contain the same concoction used by Schabbs to create his undead abominations, as the skin of the player's status bar portrait turns a sickly gray (complemented by red eyes) if killed by one. As killing Schabbs is the primary objective in Episode Two, his death triggers the ending automatically.Hitler's Mech-ArmourAdolf Hitler (powered armour)Hit Points: 800 (Skill 1), 950 (Skill 2), 1050 (Skill 3), 1200 (Skill 4)Point Value: 5000 Clad in a full-body suit of mechanical armor, Hitler proves to be well-prepared for any would-be assassins when confronted by Blazkowicz at the end of the third episode. Boasting a total of four mounted Chain Gun emplacements, the F&#252;hrer is fully equipped to tear opponents apart should they venture too close to him. With such a massive size, though, the footfalls of the monstrous Mecha-Hitler are clearly audible, which can be helpful in keeping away from the full brunt of its guns. Once the player manages to whittle down and destroy the armor protecting Hitler, the leader of the Third Reich springs forth from its remains to continue the battle personally...Adolf HitlerAdolf HitlerHit Points: 500 (Skill 1), 700 (Skill 2), 800 (Skill 3), 900 (Skill 4)Point Value: 5000 Even with his mechanized armor suit destroyed, Hitler is still a considerable threat to B.J. Blazkowicz, and in fact his sheer damage potential is not reduced when compared to his previous form despite the fact that he carries only two Chain Guns to the Mecha-Hitler's four. Though somewhat less durable in the flesh, Hitler receives a tremendous boost in speed (putting him on par with the fleet-footed Officers), which makes him just as troublesome and gives the player less time overall to react to his movements. His ultimate defeat is the primary objective of the original trilogy, and since later episodes were positioned as prequels, Hitler's downfall is canonically the final event in Wolfenstein 3D, but it is just the beginning for the franchise...Otto GiftmacherOtto GiftmacherHit Points: 850 (Skill 1), 950 (Skill 2), 1050 (Skill 3), 1200 (Skill 4)Point Value: 5000 Dubbed "The Poisonmaker" due to his heinous proclivities, Otto Giftmacher is a creator of chemical weapons for the Third Reich and the first boss encounter in Wolfenstein 3D's Nocturnal Missions. He attacks with a hand-held Rocket Launcher, which behaves more or less like the player's own Rocket Launcher in the port versions of the game. As projectiles, Giftmacher's rockets can be effectively dodged much like Dr. Schabbs syringes, and listening for audio cues can be helpful in this respect, as the Rocket Launcher emits a telltale sound whenever it fires off a rocket. Upon emerging victorious against him, the protagonist discovers that the Nazis' chemical warfare initiative is already well underway.Gretel GrosseGretel GrosseHit Points: 850 (Skill 1), 950 (Skill 2), 1050 (Skill 3), 1200 (Skill 4)Point Value: 5000 The sibling of one Hans Grosse, Gretel bears more than a passing resemblance to her brother, and even carries a Chain Gun in each hand just like Hans. Situated at the end of Episode Five, Gretel is tasked with safeguarding plans for the Nazis' chemical weapons attacks, and only by defeating her can the player character hope to acquire them in time to stop General Fettgesicht. Her similarity to Hans Grosse is more than skin deep, as, statistically, she is identical to the boss of Episode One both in the properties of her attack and her hit point totals. As with all hitscan weapons in Wolfenstein 3D, Gretel's Chain Guns become deadlier as the player draws closer, so keeping one's distance is paramount.General FettgesichtGeneral FettgesichtHit Points: 850 (Skill 1), 950 (Skill 2), 1050 (Skill 3), 1200 (Skill 4)Point Value: 5000 The ultimate opponent in Wolfenstein 3D's Nocturnal Missions and the deviant strategist behind the Third Reich's chemical warfare campaign, General Fettgesicht is Blazkowicz's final target in Episode Six, and killing him puts the final nail in the coffin of Nazi Germany's chemical weapons program. Holding a Chain Gun in his left hand and a Rocket Launcher in his right, Fettgesicht has the honor of being the only Wolfenstein 3D boss, indeed the only enemy in the game, bar none, to have two distinct weapon types. Due to his tendency to fire both weapons in tandem, it is generally not advisable to dodge his rockets while returning fire, as the player will most likely take damage from his Chain Gun even when successful.[CR]Ports[CR]Due to its popularity, Wolfenstein 3D was ported to a number of different platforms in the years following its initial PC release. While some ports, such as the Game Boy Advance version, were extremely faithful to the original game, others were wildly divergent, changing many aspect of the game, both cosmetic and otherwise. The release of the SNES version of Wolfenstein 3D marks the genesis of what many Wolfenstein fans refer to as the "Mac Family" of ports, consisting of several releases which are markedly different from Wolfenstein 3D on the PC, though noticeably similar to one another. Some of the characteristic changes in these versions include the addition of two new weapons (the Flamethrower and the Rocket Launcher), dramatic changes to the format of the campaign as well as the structure of individual levels, and the adoption of content (i.e., textures, items, and enemies) native to Wolfenstein 3D's sequel, Spear of Destiny.Super Nintendo VersionThe SNES port of Wolfenstein 3D replaces Dogs with "Mutated Rats".Because of inherent limitations in system hardware, the SNES release of Wolfenstein 3D features 32x32 wall textures rather than the 64x64 size used on the PC. This version is also well-known for being heavily censored. Not only were overt references to Nazism and most appearances of blood removed from the game, but the game's enemies also no longer speak German, and religious references like the Cross treasure item were removed as well. Finally, the German Shepherd was completely removed from the game, presumably over animal cruelty concerns, and in its place the game features a giant gray Mutated Rat. The floor color in this version was changed from gray to brown, which some have postulated was done to help the game's gray Rat enemies stand out against the floor.The game's status bar was redone for the SNES, with a redrawn player portrait and an "Item" section, which tracks the number of treasures collected. The Flamethrower and the Rocket Launcher are introduced in this port, and all of the existing weapons feature new graphical treatment. The single-player campaign itself is pared down to just 30 missions from the 60 featured on the PC, and while the included levels are based on those found on the PC, they are not completely faithful to the original maps. The game is also presented as a single linear progression of levels rather than being broken up into discreet episodes. Bosses from the Nocturnal Missions do not appear in this campaign, however three Spear of Destiny bosses (Trans Grosse, the Ubermutant, and the Death Knight) are incorporated, as are new items such as Ammo Boxes, Fuel Cans, and Rocket Boxes.Jaguar VersionWolfenstein 3D on the Jaguar features a greatly minimized HUD.While very similar to the SNES version of the game, Wolfenstein 3D on the Atari Jaguar makes several additional changes. The most immediately noticeable difference is a large leap in graphical fidelity above and beyond even the PC version of the game, using 128x128 wall textures, which are accompanied by new enemy graphics. The Jaguar port remains uncensored, though it does retain the same brown floor coloration of the SNES version. The status bar is removed entirely from the game and replaced with a more minimal heads-up display system, showing only the player's health, ammo, and any keys acquired (as well as B.J.'s portrait to the left). The weapon visuals on the Jaguar are unique to this iteration, and a few of the game's armaments, most notably the Pistol, Chain Gun, and Rocket Launcher, are conspicuously similar in appearance to their counterparts in the Doom series.While the level structure of the Jaguar conforms to the same 30-level campaign seen on the SNES, which includes the new weapons, some of the game's mechanics are changed. Treasure items inexplicably act as a means of health restoration, and though the same four types exist, they all bestow four percentage points of health. Treasure items also have the potential to heal the player above 100% health. The Atari Wolfenstein port was also unique for having different enemy sets for each of its four difficulty levels; in most other versions that have four difficulty settings, the bottom settings share identical enemy placement.3DO VersionClassic gray floors make their return in Wolfenstein 3D for the 3DO.The 3DO release of Wolfenstein 3D takes after the Atari Jaguar, featuring many of the same graphical upgrades and the increased 128x128 texture size over the PC. It also reverts to the classic grey floor colour of the original Wolfenstein 3D while using the weapon graphics introduced in the SNES version. One of the more striking aspect of the 3DO version, however, is its audio presentation. The sound effects and music were redone in a higher fidelity for the port, making it one of the best-sounding ports of Wolfenstein 3D overall. In addition to the weapon graphics, the status bar of the SNES version was also adopted on the 3DO, as were the altered treasure mechanics which tabulate the raw number of treasures collected rather than assigning a point value to the different types.Like all games in the "Mac Family," the 3DO port features a 30-mission adaptation of the original Wolfenstein campaign commonly referred to as the Second Encounter. Unlike previous ports, though, the 3DO also presents the player with a six-episode Third Encounter, which is more directly analogous to the format and composition of the original Wolfenstein 3D levels. The Third Encounter levels are not one-to-one recreations, though, and furthermore incorporate weapons and items not present at the time of the PC version's creation, but on the whole they are far more accurate representations of the original levels than the maps presented in Second Encounter, which are loose approximations.Macintosh VersionThe Macintosh port of Wolfenstein 3D is most similar to the 3DO version, incorporating higher resolution graphics and offering the chance to play both the Second and Third Encounter. A demo version of the Mac port was also disseminated, called First Encounter, which allows the player to fight up to the game's first boss fight with Hans Grosse much like the shareware version of Wolfenstein 3D on the PC does. Since this demo is based on the Second Encounter rather than id's original episodes, however, this includes only three levels, whereas the PC shareware release placed Hans Grosse at the end of a full ten-level episode.[CR]PC System Requirements[CR]MinimumIBM-PC and CompatiblesMS-DOS(R) 5.0 or higher640K RAM3 MB available Hard Disk Space386/33 MHz ProcessorVGA graphicsJoystick and mouse optionalSupports Sound Blaster and 100% compatible sound cards[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Boss Level  Passwords (Easy)[CR]At the Main Menu, enter the cooresponding codes to go to the bosses on Easy level:[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Boss Level  Passwords (Easy)[CR]At the Main Menu, type in the cooresponding codes into the password screen:</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]World Cup USA '94 is a soccer game developed by Tiertex Design Studios and published by U.S. Gold (SunSoft for Japanese releases) for multiple platforms. It is based on and licensed by the 1994 FIFA World Cup tournament, which was staged in nine cities across the United States of America. The 1994 World Cup mascot, a brown soccer-playing dog named Striker, features heavily in the game's menus and box art. The game was released on almost every home computer and console active in 1994. This would be the last officially produced FIFA World Cup game, as World Cup tournaments would be folded into EA Sports's annualized FIFA Soccer games.[CR]The Super Nintendo version of World Cup USA 94 features all 24 qualifying teams for the 1994 World Cup and eight additional teams that did not qualify (including England, Scotland, France, Japan and other countries that traditionally buy a lot of soccer games). Non-qualifying teams are marked with an asterisk (*). Other versions had different assortments of non-qualifying teams, including Canada, Austria, Uruguay and the former nation of Czechoslovakia.USAGermanyMexicoGreeceRussiaColombiaBrazilBoliviaSwitzerlandItalyNorwayEngland*Republic of Ireland (Eire)Scotland*Denmark*BelgiumRomaniaSwedenFrance*MoroccoCameroonArgentinaJapan*South KoreaPortugal*Netherlands (Holland)SpainWales*NigeriaSaudi ArabiaAustralia*Bulgaria[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>World Heroes</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]World Heroes is a 2D fighting game developed in 1992 by                                         ADK and published by     SNK for the                       Neo Geo. Its premise was that a scientist named Dr. Brown created a time machine and used it to organize a martial arts tournament for various historical fighters. Many of the fighters are based on historical figures and fictional characters. The game was mainly dismissed due to its similarities with                        Street Fighter II, but received a cult following that spawned three sequels. The game also debuts the two ninjas,                      Hanzo and                     Fuuma (who are similar in terms of                    Ryu and                   Ken), who later returned in                  NeoGeo Battle Coliseum.  The game was ported to the                SNES in 1993 by                 SunSoft, which is considered the best version due to the ability to use a five-button configuration instead of three (Two for punches, two for kicks, and either shoulder button for throwing) while improving button response and retaining everything about the original version. The game was also ported to the               Sega Genesis in 1994 by              Sega, which is considered one of the worst Neo Geo conversions of all time. The original version was released for the            Neo Geo CD with an arranged soundtrack in 1995 and the           Wii Virtual Console on September 28, 2007. The game was also included in the          World Heroes Anthology compilation for the         PlayStation 2 and an unlockable game in the        SNK Arcade Classics V.1 compilation for the PlayStation 2,       PlayStation Portable, and      Wii. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]World Heroes plays like a traditional 2D fighter, using three attack buttons. (one for punches, one for kicks, and one for throws) Holding down the punch or kick button makes the attack stronger while simply tapping the button gives a quick strike.  The game also featured Death Match mode, which significantly changed the arena to include gameplay obstacles. Arenas could have mines or slippery oil covering parts of the arena. The edges of the arenas could even have electric beams or spiked walls. [CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]    Hanzo (based on Hanzo Hattori)    Fuuma (based on Fuma Kotaro)    Kim Dragon (based on    Bruce Lee)    Janne D'Arc (based on    Joan of Arc)                                 Julius Carn (based on                                   Genghis Khan)    Muscle Power (based on    Hulk Hogan)    Brocken    Rasputin (based on Grigori Rasputin)                                         Geegus (boss, based on                                T-1000)[CR]Critical Reception[CR]   When released for the SNES Electronic Gaming Monthly Assigned scores of 8,6,6 and 6 with Ed Semrad writing, "...The best part of this game is the death match, where anything goes.  It would be nice if there was blood when you hit the spikes though.  The play control is good for most of the fighters and the only down point is that it plays slow.  Fighting fans who can't afford a Neo will be happy with this one".[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]World Heroes 2 is a 2D fighting game developed by  ADK and published by  SNK for the  Neo Geo. It is a direct sequel to  World Heroes, adding six new playable characters and one new boss. Death Match mode from the previous game received an overhaul, adding and removing obstacles (mine fields, moving saws, laser beams, slippery floors, and smaller arenas) while completely changing the lifebar system to one large tug-of-war lifebar. Gameplay additions include taunting (standing far back while pressing the throw button), throw reversals (throwing at the moment you're being grabbed, can cause "throw battles") and projectile reflection (blocking at the very moment a projectile reaches you, similar to the  Just Defend system of  Garou: Mark of the Wolves).[CR]The game was ported to the  SNES and  TurboGrafx CD by  Takara. The original version of the game was released on the  Neo Geo CD with an arranged soundtrack and released on the  World Heroes Anthology compilation for the  PlayStation 2.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR] Hanzo (based on Hanzo Hattori) Fuuma (based on Fuma Kotaro) Kim Dragon (based on  Bruce Lee) Janne D'Arc (based on  Joan of Arc) Julius Carn (based on  Genghis Khan) Muscle Power (based on  Hulk Hogan) Brocken Rasputin (based on Grigori Rasputin) Mudman Ryoko Izumo (based on Ryoko Tani) Captain Kidd (based on William Kidd) Erick (based on Erik the Red) Johnny Maximum Shura (based on Nai Khanom Tom)Neo Geegus (boss, based on  T-1000) Dio (boss)[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]World Soccer '94: Road to Glory is a soccer game best known as Striker in Europe. It was originally released on the Amiga and Atari ST computers, and was ported to DOS, Amiga CD32, Genesis and SNES. The SNES release changed the name for each region: World Soccer '94: Road to Glory in the US, World Soccer in Japan, Striker for most of Europe and Eric Cantona's Football Challenge in France.[CR]The first game in the cult Striker series, this game features fast paced soccer similar to Sensible Soccer although Striker uses a 3D top-down view. The game has sixty-four selectable International teams that range from Brazil to Qatar. Every team is editable from the options menu.[CR]The game was followed by multiple sequels. World Cup Striker (known as Elite Soccer in the US) came out for the Super Nintendo the following year. Striker Pro, Striker World Cup Special and Striker '96 are all from the same series as well.[CR][B]Modes:[/B][CR]Super Cup: A straight knockout tournament featuring all sixty-four teamsTournament Mode: The same as the Super Cup but the user can select the teams involvedLeague Mode: A custom league made up of as many or as little teams. Everyone plays each other twiceIndoor Soccer: The option to play the game on a shorter, in-door pitch. Here the games were more frantic as pretty much everyone played striker with little in the way of defence.Teams[CR]Striker has one of the largest selections of national teams of any Arcade-style soccer game. They include:AlbaniaAlgeriaAngolaArgentinaAustriaBelgiumBoliviaBrazilBulgariaCameroonCanadaChileColombiaCosta RicaCyprusDenmarkEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEnglandFHeroes (an all-stars team)FinlandFranceGermanyGreeceGuatemalaHolland (The Netherlands)HungaryIcelandIsraelItalyJapanKenyaLiberiaLuxembourgMalawiMaltaMexicoMoroccoNigeriaNorwayNorthern IrelandNorth KoreaParaguayPeruPolandPortugalQatarRomaniaRussiaRepublic of IrelandSaudi ArabiaScotlandSpainSwedenSwitzerlandSouth KoreaTrinidad and TobagoTurkeyUruguayUnited Arab EmiratesUnited StatesVenezuelaWales[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>WWF Royal Rumble</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]WWF Royal Rumble is LJN's "sequel" to WWF Super Wrestlemania. WWF Royal Rumble features twelve wrestlers in each version, some wrestlers exclusive to each port of the game. There was an updated port featuring a bigger roster and other features added in called WWF Rage in the Cage released on the Sega CD. Both the SNES and Genesis versions of Royal Rumble support up to 2 players. Royal Rumble on the Genesis had a VRC (Video Game Rating Council) rating of GA for General Audience.[CR]Match Types[CR]One on One (One wrestler against one other wrestler)One Fall - First player to score a pinfall is the winner.Brawl - First player to deplete the other players energy bar is the winner.Tournament - Player must face all the opponents in order to get to the title.[CR]Tag-Team (Teams of two wrestlers. The "legal" wrestler must make a tag in order to switch.)One Fall - First team to score the pinfall is the winner.Brawl - First team to deplete the other teams energy bar is the winner.Tournament - Face all other superstars in tag teams to get to the titles.[CR]Triple Tag-Team (Teams of three wrestlers each. The "legal" wrestler must make a tag in order to switch.)One Fall - First Team to score the pinfall is the winner.Brawl - First team to deplete the other teams energy bar wins the match.[CR]Royal Rumble (Free for all 12 wrestler over the top rope battle royal.)[CR][B]Endings:[/B][CR]SNES VersionOnce the Royal Rumble has been won, whichever character the player chose will raise their hands above their heads and the screen will fade to black. When the screen comes back it will list the times of all the entrants in the Royal Rumble match, then cycle through the order they were thrown out and by whom they were thrown out.Genesis VersionOnce all the other characters have been beaten, the player will face the final wrestler. The final wrestler is Razor Ramon. After Razor is defeated an issue of WWF Magazine will fly at the screen featuring the wrestler chosen and the headline "New World's Champion."[CR]Roster[CR]For a list of all characters in the game, see the guide.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 7,6,7,7 and 6. Mike Weigand, who gave the game a six, wrote, "Played the SNES version? This one is basically the same thing on a different platform. The colors are diminished somewhat, but wrestling fans will love it! Be sure to use the 6-button controller with this one!".[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Different chairs at ringside[CR]If the dark-green steel chair at ringside has been used, bring the action to the upper part of the screen, in the ring, so that you can't see past the outside of the ring on the button of the screen. Now, go back down and to the outside of the ring. You'll discover that a new light-green chair has replaced the old chair. Repeating this process will make another new chair, this time blue, appear on the outside. Do this once more, and you'll find a brown chair. From here, the cycle will continue back to the dark-green chair.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Different chairs at ringside[CR]On the character select screen, you'll see the WWF logo behind the wrestlers. If you press the L button, you can slow down/stop the logo or if you press the R button, you can speed up the logo.</plot>

				<title_clean>WWF WrestleMania - The Arcade Game</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]WWF WrestleMania: The Arcade Game is an exaggerated fighting game that uses digitized sprites of the featured professional wrestlers, similar to Mortal Kombat. Players battle through one-on-one, one-on-two, and one-on-three matches to claim either the Intercontinental Championship or WWF Heavyweight Championship. Vince McMahon and Jerry Lawler provided commentary and the game was later ported to home consoles by Acclaim Studios Salt Lake City, which would make the successor title, WWF in Your House.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]The UndertakerShawn MichaelsBret HartRazor RamonLex LugerBam Bam Bigelow (Not playable in the SNES version)Yokozuna (Not playable in the SNES version)Doink The Clown[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Developed by Midway, WWF Wrestlemania plays similarly to Mortal Kombat, with a few exceptions. Characters can move in somewhat 3-D space, in that you can walk up and down, as well as left and right. Combat features 5 buttons, Light Punch, Power Punch, Light Kick, Power Kick and Block. It is also possible to Run by pressing Light Punch and Light Kick together.[CR]The main game consists of the player choosing to go after the Intercontinental title or the World Wrestling Federation Title. In the Intercontinental Title challenge, you'll face 4 opponents via 1-on-1 matches, followed by two 2-on-1 matches, and finally a 3-on-1 match. In the WWF Title Challenge, you'll start out with four 2-on-1 matches, moving on to two 3-on-1 matches, and finally the "Wrestlemania Challenge", a gauntlet match against every wrestler in the game. In the final match, however, only 4 people (including yourself) will be in the ring at once. Once you eliminate an opponent, someone will replace them until you've beaten all eight opponents.[CR]Each character has a unique ending.[CR]The only known "finishing move", similar to a Fatality, is done by the Undertaker. Originally the game was scheduled to have finishing moves for each character, but the WWF shot down the plan.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]X-Kaliber 2097 (JP: Sword Maniac) is a cyberpunk side-scrolling brawler-platformer action game for the Super Nintendo. The player, as the swordsman Slash, must fight his way through the city to topple its despotic ruler Raptor and rescue his partner Alix.[CR]The game was released in the US and Japan in February 1994, and in Europe a few months later in December. Activison published the game in the west, while Toshiba-EMI published the Japanese version. The Japanese version has a different title, a different story and different character names.[CR]The game's marketing pushed the involvement of electronic/industrial group Psykosonik, which provided the game's music for the US version of the game. Hitoshi Sakimoto and Hayato Matsuo composed the Japanese version's soundtrack.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]X-Kaliber 2097 is set in the distant future, in the city of Neo New York. A tyrant known as Raptor rules the city through treachery, bribes, and his army of "morphs". Two agents, Slash, and his partner Alix refuse to submit to Raptor's dominion and this causes him great fear. Raptor decides to capture Alix and hold her for ransom until Slash surrenders and hands over his sword, the X-Kaliber. Unfortunately, Slash has decided to taken it upon himself to defeat Raptor and his henchmen once and for all.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The story mode of X-Kaliber 2097 is a 2D side-scrolling platformer/brawler, where the player controls Slash as he progresses through each stage. The stages are a mix of platforming and fighting off robotic soldiers using a few different moves such as jumping, ducking, blocking, and several different kinds of sword attacks. At the end of each stage, Slash must duel one of Raptor's henchmen, which is the most challenging part of the game. Each stage boss has a similar set of moves to Slash and the player must learn each boss's strategy to win.[CR]The duel mode of X-Kaliber 2097 is a 2D fighting game that allows two players to choose from Slash and the game's 'boss' characters and fight, using each character's own set of moves.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Codes[CR] At the title screen, press:</plot>

				<title_clean>X-Men - Mutant Apocalypse</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse is a brawler based on the animated series in the early 1990s which is set in the X-Men world. It follows an original plot concerning the island nation of Genosha, which has started taking mutants hostage and is gearing up for a possible invasion of Sentinels. Five X-Men are sent in to sabotage the various facilities on Genosha and foil the villains behind the plot. The game eventually moves to Magneto's space station base, Avalon. Each of the X-Men's missions are unique to them, and occasionally make use of their specific powers.[CR]The game was exclusive to the Super Nintendo and was released in the US, Europe and Japan. It was coincidentally released the same month as the similar Wolverine: Adamantium Rage, which was produced by LJN.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story first explains about what the mutants are and how they were helped. It is then revealed that there are mutants who were captured on the island of Genosha, who are then forced into labor by an army of robots called the Sentinels. It is believed that the powerful immortal mutant Apocalypse is responsible for these acts of terror. And so the five X-Men members were sent out to Genosha Island to infiltrate the island, rescue the mutants and gather information on Apocalypse's plans. All members of the X-Men split up to take out the enemies. Every mutant has direct objectives:Wolverine will access the Sentinel factory to destroy the robots.Cyclops will intercept the train transport from the Genoshan army to destroy their access to supplies.Psylocke goes full offensive on the main base to distract the army's attention.Gambit sneaks into the harbor to eliminate the enemies.Beast will make his way to the central computer to gain all information of where the captured mutants have been placed.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is based on a 2D beat-em-up platformer where the player walks from the left hand side to the right, defeating enemies as they pass. Each character has their own lives counter and extra lives can be gained either by collecting icons which has an "X" on it, or later on in the game, collecting an icon with the chosen hero on it as the icon will rotate through all the characters.[CR]In the first act, there are five levels all based on each X-Men character where the level is also designed for each character's skills and even have their unique bosses.[CR]At some stage in the game, the levels will also be the same where all characters can play the same stage.[CR]The interface consists of the player's health bar and the name of the X-Men character shown underneath with the "X" logo on the left of the bar. When fighting boss characters, their health is shown on the right similar to the player's bar but an "E" is shown on the right of the bar.Controls[CR]The characters can be moved left and right, crouch to duck, and only two buttons are used: attack and jump.[CR]The combat works just like Final Fight where tapping the attack button near an enemy will create a chain combo. The combos can also be cancelled into special moves as well, adding extra damage to the enemy.[CR]After each level is complete, a password system (in the form of the X-Men characters) is shown on the screen so that players can re-enter this to get back where they left off in the game.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]BeastPsylockeGambitWolverineCyclops[CR]</plot>

Fires from shoulder-mounted guns.Alcedes - A beastlike robot with four arms that caries a staff. Shoots from its antennae. Xardion - An extremely powerful robot that replaces Panthera towards the end of the game. Has superlative combat abilities and has the same abilities as the three other robots.[CR]Anime giant Gainax is included in Xardion's credits, but the nature of their contribution to the game is unclear.[CR]</plot>

Initially developed by  Nintendo R&amp;D1 and published by  Nintendo, the game has been released in a variety of forms and versions since its original release. The ports of the game include the  Game Boy version (which changes little from the NES version), a  SNES version (which reskinned the game to reference  Super Mario World more frequently), and inclusion in a Japan-only compilation for the  GameCube titled Nintendo Puzzle Collection.[CR]The game included on Nintendo Puzzle Collection is technically an enhanced port of Yoshi's Cookie. There are added things, however, such as upgraded graphics and sound. Other than that, the game is completely identical to the  Super Nintendo Entertainment System version of the game).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game is made up of a square grid, broken up into 25 to 49 sections (5 x 5 or 7 x 7) depending on the version. Cookies of various decorations fill in the entire grid. The player manipulates entire rows either horizontally or vertically to try to match cookies that are alike. Once a row is filled with cookies of the same design, their point count increases by one and the row is wiped off of the screen.[CR]The multiplayer portion of this game has two of the cookie grids side by side, with a different player controlling each grid while different power-ups cycle on the screen. Once a player correctly aligns a row of cookies, the power up on the screen at that time is put upon the opposing player. This could range from losing five points to scrambling the cookies on their grid.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Yoshi's Safari</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Yoshi's Safari is a 1993 SNES release that was designed for use with the Super Scope accessory. The game plays from the perspective of Mario riding atop Yoshi's back, and he must use the Super Scope to defeat the enemies they encounter along the way and thwart Bowser's latest scheme. Throughout the game, the player encounters numerous foes from the ranks of Mario's traditional enemies such as the Koopa Kids, Big Boo, Big Blooper, and many more. The game's levels feature branching pathways, jumps and other obstacles that must be traversed as the player battles to recollect stolen gems.[CR]The game could be played by one player with the Super Scope, or by two players, with the second controlling Yoshi's movement with a controller.[CR]Historical Notes[CR]Yoshi's Safari was the first game released in western territories to refer to Princess Peach by her original name. All prior Mario games released in western territories that featured the princess had her name changed to Princess Toadstool.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the review scores of 6,6,7,7 and 4 out of ten. Mike Weigand, who gave the score of 4 out of ten, wrote, "After playing this for a while you will want to turn the SuperScope on yourself and end it all! Yoshi's Safari suffers from one fatal flaw -- it is way too easy. The scrolling and graphics are excellent, but that is it!".[CR]</plot>

Naturally, it is your job to save this world and also to rescue the aforementioned woman who has been kidnapped by the Shadow King. This is done in typical action adventure fashion: you have to fight enemies using spells that are gathered during the progress of the game as well as solve puzzles and use several objects. What sets Young Merlin apart from other action adventures is the fact that there is no text in the entire game, instead, icons are used to represent conversations, furthermore, the game uses passwords,instead of a battery to record the players progress.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Progress Passwords[CR]Enter these passwords on the Options Menu into the Sword.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Progress Passwords[CR]NOTE:[CR]^ = Up on directional pad[CR]v = Down on directional pad[CR] &amp;gt; = Right on directional pad[CR] &amp;lt; = Left on directional pad</plot>

				<title_clean>Ys III - Wanderers from Ys</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ys III: Wanderers From Ys is the third entry in the Ys series. Taking place nearly three years after the events in Ys I &amp; II, Adol and his companion, Dogi, have been wandering the land. On their journey, the two had heard rumors regarding Dogi's hometown, Redmont, that prompted them to venture there. Dogi's hometown, located in the land of Felghana, had been experiencing crop failure as well as vicious nighttime attacks. Not afraid of the danger, Adol and Dogi set forth on their new adventure.[CR]Ys III, like its predecessors, was originally released on the NEC PC-8801 and its upgraded version PC-9801 in 1989. It was soon ported to other Japanese home computers, like the MSX and Sharp X68000. A couple of years later, it was ported to the SNES, Genesis and TurboGrafx-CD. These console ports all received English localizations.[CR]Ys III would be remade as Ys: The Oath in Felghana for the PC in 2005. It follows the same story, but uses the engine from Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim. Its PSP and 2012 Steam re-release versions were localized into English by XSEED.[CR]When released Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded scores of 7,8,7,8 saying, "...misses the high mark of the original. There is little or no challenge here and the whole quest is too straightforward for an adventure game".[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ys III features several new additions to the Ys series, while also retaining several components. The most important change comes in the form of it's gameplay. No longer played from a top-down perspective, Ys III is played from a side-scrolling perspective not unlike another Falcom-developed title, Sorcerian. With a change in perspective also comes a change in game mechanics. Players now have direct control over Adol's ability to attack, either with ducking, forward, or overhead sword attacks, which is a major departure from the previous game. In Ys I &amp; II, players had to come in contact with enemies in order to damage them, as the majority of attacks were done automatically. Only in Ys II did players have a controllable attack in the form of a fireball. Another major change is the ability to jump. Since Ys III is also a platformer, the game has been given vertical depth, and as such, Adol needs the ability to jump to attack certain enemies and overcome obstacles. Yet another change to the gameplay system is the omission of magic points. Replaced by consumable rings, players can accrue a stock of them by defeating enemies, and subsequently use them to power the different permanent rings that Adol finds over the course of his adventure. Also of note, is that Ys III does not feature as much back-tracking as it's predecessors, and is much shorter in length because of it.[CR]As for the components that Ys III kept, the first would be the wearable rings. Found at various points in the game, Adol can obtain five different rings - power, shield, time, heal, and protection - that have the same properties as they did in the previous games. Adol must also buy or find the different swords, shields, and armors throughout the game, with five items per category just like the previous games. In addition to Adol's equipment, he must also find an array of items, keys, and objects to aid him in his journey and to open up new paths. Ys III also has an experience point system like the previous games, however, depending on the version played, the game will either feature diminishing experience points ( TGCD) or not ( SNES). Ys III also allows players to save at any time they wish, except during boss fights.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Debug Code[CR]Turn on the game and wait for the Sammy logo to fade completely in. Then quickly enter this code on Controller 2: Up, Down, Up, Down, Select, Start. Start the game, and press Select to bring up the menu. Choose Status, then press Select on Controller 2. The word ''Debug'' will appear next to ''Status''. This will make you invincible and give you access to all areas on the world map.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Debug Code[CR]Start a game and then save and exit. [CR]You must have 2 controllers plugged in for this to work. [CR]1) Turn the power on and wait until the logo screen appears (can't remember exactly what it is, but it is the one that fades in and out). [CR]2) On the 2nd controller, when the logo gets through fading in (on mine, it fades in really white then gets a shade darker) and press Up, Down, Up, Down, Select, and Start before the logo fades out. [CR]3) Continue with the game you started.  While in the game, go to the status subscreen. [CR]4) On controller 2 hit Select and you should see DEBUG pop up.  If not, then you must try the code again.  After DEBUG pops up you are invincible.  Your health can go all the way back down, but after it gets past 1, it goes all the way back up.  [CR]Enjoy.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Debug Code[CR]Press Select on Controller 1 to bring up the menu, then press Select on Controller 2 for a sound test.</plot>

				<title_clean>Zombies Ate My Neighbors</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Zombies Ate My Neighbors (simply Zombies in Europe and Australia) is a top-down action shooter developed by Lucasarts. The game takes place during some unspecified event that has caused zombies and a whole host of other B-movie style monsters to run amok in a suburban setting. Alone or in two-player co-op, players have to roam a huge number of levels killing monsters and rescuing their innocent neighbors.[CR]The game was originally published by Konami for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis on September 1993. On October 26, 2009, it was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player begins by selecting either Zeke or Julie, and in co-op, the player that they don't choose is controlled by player two. Gameplay is top-down, with fairly simple controls. Players can have one weapon and one item selected at any time, and scroll through these as needed. Most levels see the player dropped into an environment with the objective of rescuing a certain number of survivors. Survivors are stationary, and often placed in hard-to-reach areas. The player has a GPS-like radar that can be activated, displaying the number of survivors remaining and their location when sufficiently close. When the player runs into a survivor, that survivor is deemed as 'saved' and disappears. When no survivors remain in a level, a freestanding exit door appears next to the player, who can choose to further explore or exit the level. Survivors are killed if they are attacked by an enemy; a loud cry alerts the player to a death and an angel floats up from the survivor as part of the death animation. If the player fails to rescue a specified number of survivors, they fail the level.[CR]The environment and enemies vary largely from level to level. Some levels see players facing only one kind of enemy, while others force them to deal with waves of different enemies. Locations range from suburban backyards and shopping malls to horror clich&#233;s like castles and pyramids. Each level's number and name is displayed before the level begins. These titles are often done in B-movie style and reflect the content of the level: for example, Level 12: Mars Needs Cheerleaders features only Martians as enemies and only Cheerleaders as survivors.Julie in one of Mall levels[CR]Different enemy classes are vulnerable to different attacks. Whilst low-level enemies like zombies will succumb to almost anything, other enemies are more vulnerable to certain weapons, and may be immune to some attacks. This vulnerability is usually referencing popular myth or fiction on the subject; Werewolves are most vulnerable to thrown silverware, for example. Other vulnerabilities are less grounded in logic; Martians, for example, are most vulnerable to tomatoes.[CR]Weapons are found in the environment, and most are everyday objects. The basic weapon is the squirt gun, which the player always starts with. Other weapons include foodstuffs, such as Icepops, and tools, such as the weedwacker. More far-fetched weapons are also found in certain situations. Killing a Martian will force him to drop his Bubble Gun, whilst the Pandora's Box item can be found in pyramids. Levels contain chests, cupboards, and similar that can be opened to find weapons and items. Most levels contain locked doors, which have to be opened with a Key or otherwise bypassed. A Key works on any door, but can only be used once. Occasionally, levels contain Skeleton Doors, which can only be opened with a much rarer Skeleton Key. Environments also contain destructible walls, which can be identified by the cracks in them. These can be opened with a sufficiently strong attack, such as a Bazooka, or by tricking a sufficiently strong enemy into destroying it.[CR]Items are usually less attack-based than weapons, and have a range of effects. Med Kits restore health, and Keys open doors. Decoy Clowns are inflatable laughing toys that distract all enemies in the area. Speed Boots give the player increased speed for a short period. There are also several potions; one turns the player into a fearsome invulnerable monster for a short period, one turns the player into a ghost who can walk past enemies unharmed and undetected for a short time.[CR]Most levels do not actually require the player to kill enemies. The player can run faster than most enemies, and evasion is as viable a tactic as firepower. Certain situations do force the player into combat, however, such as the level that forces the player to take down an extremely powerful Giant Baby to obtain the Skeleton Key required to rescue the level's lone survivor.Zeke in one of the Suburbs levels[CR]The player has a life bar and a number of extra lives. The life bar is depleted when attacked by enemies or environmental hazards, but can be restored by using the Med Kits that are found throughout the environment. Extra Lives are earned between levels by score. This makes it in the player's best interests to rescue as many survivors as possible, as rescuing all survivors in a level confers a huge bonus. When a health bar is depleted all the way, the player's character sways dizzily and falls over. An extra life is used automatically, and the player's character reappears with a short period of invulnerability. Dying with no extra lives remaining takes the player to a Game Over screen and then returns them to the main menu. After certain levels, a four-character password is given to the players so they may continue from that level in the case a Game Over occurs.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]The Exit that appears after rescuing all the neighbors.

Like the Super NES version, this is an excellent game for one or two players, loaded with references to old horror movies!".[CR]The magazine also issued the game its "Editors' Choice Gold award.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Zool is a platformer originally developed by Gremlin Graphics for the Commodore Amiga, and was later ported to multiple other platforms. It follows  Zool, a ninja from the Nth Dimension who has crash landed on a mysterious planet and must traverse many different levels.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay in Zool is side-scrolling platforming gameplay in which the player's aim is merely to reach the end of the level, where a gold coin would be collected. Obstacles and enemies litter the 2D worlds, and the game is known for being very difficult. Zool has the ability to perform jumps, punches, kicks, sliding tackles, fire a "magic cannon" weapon and perform 4 different magic spells. The magic spells vary greatly, and include an invincibility spell, a fire blast spell which kills all enemies on screen, a duplication spell which creates a second Zool, doubling the players fire power and one that increases his jumping ability. Zool can also climb walls by clinging onto the wall, and jumping upwards before clinging to it again.[CR]At intervals within a level there are checkpoints, which are different items in each world. Upon passing the point it will activate, and if the player is killed, Zool will respawn at the checkpoint. Zool can take 4 hits of damage before dying, and can replenish his life with flying hearts gained from killing some enemies. There is a score system which serves no purpose other than for players to attempt to achieve high scores. Killing enemies and collecting collectibles are the main methods of gaining points but they can also be gained from a variety of methods depending on the level. For example walking on the piano in the music world both plays a tune, and gives the player some points.[CR][B]Worlds:[/B][CR]There are 7 different worlds in Zool, each with varying environments, enemies, collectibles etc. Each world has three levels.Sweet World[CR]The sweet world is a candy based world full of yummy treats for Zool to collect and kill. Enemies include jellies, bees and even a Bertie Basset. There are spike pits and spike creatures on walls and chocolate rivers which slow down Zool's movement. Rafts float on the rivers which can be used to traverse the rivers without slowing of movement.Music World[CR]The music world is a world of music. Musical instruments can be the players friends or enemies. Walking Cymbals and Drums are among Zool's enemies, while points can be gained by making music from walking along a giant music keyboard.Fruit &amp; Veg World[CR]The Fruit &amp; Veg world is a giant garden, where fruit can both help and hinder Zool. Brussel sprouts, carrots and grapes are the enemies. Other fruits, along with chopped off carrot tops can be collected to gain points.Tool World[CR]Tool world is full of lethal tools. From hammers trying to hit him, to drills trying to drill him, Zool is not safe in this dangerous world. Greased platforms hinder his movement and makes him slide down drops.Toy World[CR]The toy world features many dangerous toy based enemies, from marbles to toy tanks.Fun Fair World[CR]The fun fair world is anything but fun for Zool. Lethal hammers and candy-floss are some of Zool's enemies in this world. There is even an arcade cabinet in the amusement arcades which allows the players to play Zool.Shoot 'em Up World[CR]The seventh world is hidden through the other levels, and takes a departure from the platforming gameplay, and is a space shooter.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]Zool has multiple options for the background music in the game. The option to turn the music off altogether exists, along with 4 unique music styles, Rave, Rock, Green and Funk.[CR][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B] Stage Select[CR]On the options screen, press Down, L, R, Down, L, Up, Down, Up, R, Up, R, then press Up + A + B. A sound will confirm correct code entry. Next, at the beginning of a level (where it says "Level x-x Get Ready"), hold R to access the stage select menu.</plot>

				<title_clean>Zoop</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Zoop is a real-time puzzle game that was released for a number of home systems in 1995 and 1996. Players must "zoop" incoming pieces from the sides of the screen before any can reach the center, eliminating pieces of the same color and switching colors with other pieces.[CR]Most versions of the game were released in the US and Europe. The Sega Saturn is the only exception: the Saturn release was exclusive to Japan.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Zoop's main title screen.[CR]In Zoop players control a small ship that is confined to a small box in the middle of the screen, around the box enemies of various colors try to invade the box. The player's job is to use their ship to shoot like-colored enemies, if players shoot an enemy of a different color, the ship's color changes. The challenge is to swap colors with the right enemies in order to stop all of the approaching enemies. If one of the enemies get's in the ship's box, it's game over.[CR]Every second (or more often in advanced levels), a piece comes in from the side and possibly pushes other pieces forward. Two consecutive pieces will never come in from the same quadrant.[CR]</plot>
