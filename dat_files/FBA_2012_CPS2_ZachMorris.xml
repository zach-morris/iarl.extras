Also her anklet is quite reminiscent of the spiky bracelets that Chun-li wears in the Street Fighter games.[CR]* Alien Green : His jump &amp; slam throw is clearly based on Haggar's Pile Driver in "Final Fight".[CR]Johnny (the second boss) is based on Elvis Presley. When you defeat him, he becomes fat.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]Pink Ostrich and Alien Green are very hard to clear stage 2 &amp; 3.

				<plot>Jong Pai Puzzle Choko (c) 2001 Mitchell Corp.[CR]An adult shanghai game from Mitchell. The objective is to clear the board of matching tiles before the timer runs out.[CR]Each level consists a board with two or more columns of tiles and walls slowly moving toward the center of the board.  Every time a matching pair of tiles is cleared from the board the two columns momentarily shift away from the center. The game is lost if the opposing columns of tiles run into each other or into the wall. In order to legally remove matching tiles no walls or other tiles can be in a path with two or fewer bends between the matching tiles. Once per stage, the player can request help and the two columns will shift to their starting positions and matching tiles will be highlighted for a short time. If the player cannot legally remove any more tiles then the board is 'deadlocked', and the game is lost.[CR]If the player clears the board before the timer runs out, the background girl will change into a more revealing state of undress and this new image of her will be the background for the next stage.  If the timer reaches zero the player can still attempt to clear the board but the background image will not change.  The game features four girls with two background images each and a topless image that is revealed after defeating the girl's second stage within the time limit. [CR]If the game is lost, upon continuing the player may select to attempt to clear the same board or try a new board of tiles.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Board: Green (Japan)[CR]Players: Up yo 2.[CR]Control: 8-way Joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 6 per player.[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Jong Pai Puzzle Choko was released in August 2001 in Japan only. It was known as the 37th game released for the CPS-II hardware.[CR]The title translates from Japanese as 'Yangtze River Mahjong Tile Puzzle'. The kanji 'Choko' is the Japanese name of the Chinese Yangtze River.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Concept Designer : Akihiro Akaishi[CR]Planner : Futoshi Kuwahara, Satoru Tsujita[CR]Programmer : Kaname Wada, Shigeru Komiya[CR]Graphic Designer Object : Eiko Kato, Kazue Matsunaga, TTO[CR]Graphic Designer Scroll : Satoshi Ida, Sachiko Shibuya, Hiroshi Katayama[CR]Sound BGM Composer : Takafumi Wada, Takashi Kouga, Tomoyuki Takano[CR]Sound SE Designer : Shin Yamazaki[CR]Executive Producer : Roy Ozaki, Koichi Niida[CR]</plot>

Choose a character with a 6-character name (Blue Dwarf and possibly 2 others). Press the name button and then erase it and start pressing buttons to put your own letters in.

What happens is that you can continue to enter more letters than the code expects and you begin to over-write the area of memory that contains character information and inventory. Depending on what letters you enter and how many you enter you can continue the game at the beginning of the next stage and already be hasted, invulnerable, invisible, possessing powerful weapons, etc... The character info on screen is all garbled. Once you make it to the first shop you can drag apparently empty inventory items into the trash for large sums of silver.

To gain their powers which the 'Stones' hold for the promised victory, many nations fought over the mystic stones and reheated the world of war. Within all the 'Stones' is the 'Medallion of Wisdom', known as the power source of all mystic stones, it had enough energy to terminate humanity. The whole world was in despair. And now, four brave worriers have risen to fly straight into the combat zone! All four had different reasons, but their ultimate goal was the same : to destroy the Medallion of Wisdom!

It was known as the 38th CPS-II video game.[CR]Known Export releases:[CR]"Hyper Street Fighter II - The Anniversary Edition [Blue Board]"[CR]"Hyper Street Fighter II - The Anniversary Edition [Grey Board]"[CR]The core of the game is based on "Super Street Fighter II Turbo", but now players have up to five different versions of each character to choose from. [CR]The arcade intro has reverted back to the one found in "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers" with the new addition being the title screens from the previous SFII games alternating between lightning flashes. [CR]The title screens for the CPS1 games "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", "Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition", and "Street Fighter II' - Hyper Fighting" are presented for the first time on the CPS2 hardware via this game's intro. [CR]Though the character select screen layout is the same as the one found in "Super Street Fighter II Turbo", its music has changed back to the character select music found in "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers, " which itself is a remixed version of the character select music from the CPS1 Street Fighter II games. [CR]The version of the character corresponds to the SFII game that they were playable in : [CR]'NORMAL' - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" [CR]'CHAMP' - "Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition"[CR]- Japanese version : 'DASH' - "Street Fighter II' - Champion Edition"[CR]'TURBO' - "Street Fighter II' - Hyper Fighting"[CR]'SUPER' - "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers" [CR]'SUPER T' - "Super Street Fighter II Turbo"[CR]- Japanese version : 'SUPER X' - "Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge" [CR]Note: In 1-player mode and attract mode, the CPU only uses the 'SUPER X'/'SUPER T' version of each character. [CR]The playback format of the background music has changed from "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers". In the previous game, the background music will change to the 'Heavy Damage' version of the music on the second round onward when the KO sign flashes. In this game, the background music will change to the 'Heavy Damage' version of the music only if the character that triggered the KO sign to flash is in danger of losing his or her final round. [CR]Color schemes for the stage backgrounds are still the same as for "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers" and "Super Street Fighter II Turbo". However, a few background elements originally seen exclusively in "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" have returned : [CR]1) The dual barrels and stack of boxes in Ken's stage (from "Champion Edition" to "Super Turbo" there was just a single barrel). [CR]2) The breakable 'Fuurinkazan' signs in Ryu's stage. [CR]3) The lantern on the left side of E. Honda's stage (originally seen exclusively on the SNES port of "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"). [CR]Conversely, background elements that were present since "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers" are now missing : [CR]1) The toucan that flies away at round's end in Dee Jay's stage. [CR]Another change from the previous episodes can be seen at the character selection screen, when you go on Fei Long's profile, the colonial flag of Hong Kong was changed to the flag of China due to the handover in 1997. Street Fighter has to keep up with the times![CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Holding Start while selecting 'SUPER' for the version of your character will select the secret 'Super' version of the character as found in "Super Street Fighter II Turbo". [CR]* Pressing the Start button to select your character when using the 'NORMAL', 'SUPER', or 'Old Super' version of the character will select them in an alternate classic outfit, used originally when two players simultaneously used the old version of the same character in "Super Street Fighter II Turbo". [CR]* Holding Start while selecting 'SUPER T' for the version of your character will allow certain characters to 'store' their super combos.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Street Fighter (1987)[CR]2.

				<plot>Mars Matrix - Hyper Solid Shooting (c) 2000 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]In the 25th century, Mars is home to millions of immigrants. This is because Earth was going to be overcrowded, and thus the colonization of a terraformed Mars was the only solution. The problem is, at some point, an unknown source of energy, located in the south pole, is discovered by the local government. All of a sudden, a declaration of independence arrives on Earth. What's going on? The Earth fleet goes to reveal it, with the new 'Mosquito fighters' acting as intruders...[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Green Board [Japan][CR]Players: Up to 2.[CR]Control: 8-way joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 1 per player.[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Developed by Takumi (see Staff section for more info), Mars Matrix was released in April 2000 by Capcom. It was known as the 32th video game released for the CPS-II hardware.[CR]The original arcade version could actually be maxed out, score wise: this means that you could get 999999999990 points (that's twelve digits), if you played in a flawless way. Note: This feature has been removed in the Dreamcast version, since that port added two extra digits in the score.[CR]Suleputer released a 2-CD limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Mars Matrix, Giga Wing 2 Original Soundtrack - CPCA-1050, 1051) on January 11, 2001.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Mars Matrix weapons :[CR]1) Normal rapid-fire : light-damage shooting is carried out by tapping the button.[CR]2) Load (or beam) : By pausing between attacks, and then shooting, the beam-weapon will fire. This attack is relatively powerful, can hit multiple targets, but has a much shorter range.[CR]3) Barrier : the absorption of enemy shots is performed by holding the attack button down. The player can choose the duration of absorption, and if they leave it pressed until the maximum, an explosion will result which destroys all enemies and shots displayed on the screen. On the other hand, absorbing only partially acts as a reflection attack: enemy projectiles are thrown back at the enemy.[CR]* Experience system : in Mars Matrix, there is a system which makes it possible to improve the protagonist vessel(s) by collecting gold cubes. The cubes, which come from the destruction or damage to every object in the game, add to an 'experience bar' at near the top of the screen when collected in a continuous combo. A greater amount of these gold cubes will be unleashed if the player uses reflection attacks. Once the experience bar is filled, the player's weapons will become more powerful, and then the meter zeroes out for the next experience level. A small bar located in top of the screen indicates the amount of remaining time until the combo runs out; if this happens the meter zeroes out for the current level. The meter will also reset if the player's ship is destroyed while a combo is active.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Developed by Takumi.[CR]Programmers: Takafumi Nishi, Kaju Ishii, Toshihiko Onodera, Naoto Sakurada[CR]Object designers: Ken Taketoshi, Tatsuhiro Suzuki, Hiroki Akiyama, Yuki Ootou[CR]Scroll designers: Kazumi Yogi, Tadahiro Mukaide, Akemi Ootaka[CR]Music composer: Yasushi Kaminishi[CR]Sound programmer: Masahiro Yuge[CR]Concept mechanic designers: Choco, Shorp, Nadialove Kitty, Norihiro Takikawa[CR]Planner: Ikuwo Satoh[CR]Producer: Yukikazu ozaki[CR]Executive producer: Tomoaki Fujimoto[CR]Produced by Capcom.[CR]Producer : Tatuya Minami[CR]Support from R&amp;Dept. #3 : Tomoshi Sadamoto[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles : [CR]Sega Dreamcast [JP] (November 9, 2000) [Model T-1238M][CR]</plot>

				<plot>Mighty! Pang (c) 2000 Mitchell.[CR]Mighty! Pang is the fourth game in the superb Pang series. While the artistic design has been drastically changed, Mighty! Pang retains the same gameplay of its predecessors. The game features three modes of play: panic, tour and expert modes.[CR]Tour mode is the standard mode of play featuring 57 stages. The player goes on a tour of the world, popping balloons and picking up power-ups. Each location on the tour features a number of stages which feature a new background of a famous tourist attraction. Each stage is cleared by popping all of the balloons within that stage.[CR]Expert mode is a mode for advanced players.  Play is broken up into stages like in tour mode but the stages are much more difficult.[CR]Panic mode is a basic one-stage mode of play where new balloons continuously fall from the sky. The single stage is a basic one with no platforms or barriers. Some of the smallest balloons will flash and shooting these balloons will pause all of the balloons in place for a short duration of time.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Green Board [Japan][CR]Players: Up to 2.[CR]Control: 8-way joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 6 per player.[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Mighty Pang was released in October 2000 in the Japanese arcades.

[CR]Blanka (of "Street Fighter" fame) can be seen within the background in the 'Death Valley' stage. [CR]Dan's ending is an obvious parody of the ending of the SNK game, "Art of Fighting". [CR]Sunburned (or Evil) Sakura has two separate endings (Japanese version): Kei chases Gouki and Sunburned Sakura after they teleport away [CR]1) Across the entire screen from right to left. [CR]2) Across half the screen before she trips, falls, and falls asleep. [CR]There are several cameos of Rockman in this game: [CR]1) In the mall stage, there's a cameo of a Rockman cut-out (perhaps someone in a Rockman suit). And in relation to Capcom celebrating Rockman's "10th Anniversary" in 1997, they put a banner saying '10th Anniversary: Rockman'. [CR]2) In one of Norimaro's super combos, he does a cosplay of Rockman. [CR]There is one rumored reason why Iron Man was not in this game. It is because Acclaim made an Iron Man game called "Iron Man and X-O Manowar in Heavy Metal" which was released for several consoles. [CR]Firstsmile released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter Original Soundtrack &amp; Arrange - FSCA-10017) on September 19, 1997.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Green Board revisions : [CR]REVISION 1:[CR]* Build date: 970625[CR]REVISION 2:[CR]* Build date: 970702[CR]REVISION 3:[CR]* Build date: 970707[CR]ADDITIONAL NOTES: [CR]The Japanese version features an extra playable character (his character slot on the character select screen is replaced by the MSH vs. SF logo on all non-Japanese versions), Norimaro, a silly otaku (Japanese geek specializing in anime and manga) who is a huge Chun-Li fanboy as evidence by his reaction in seeing her before the match begins. While his true intentions of entering the competition is unknown, we can assume that it was to take pictures of Chun-Li and the many superheroes. He is voiced by the comedian Kinashi Noritake and created by Capcom as being a joke character like Dan (modeled after a Japanese comedian Noritake Kinashi). He was originally going to appear in non-Japanese versions of the game, but due to cultural differences and a reference to stealing Chun-Li's panties in his ending, he was cut out. However, his programming still exists in the ROM and he even has English dialogs in the game. He even has an ending with pictures, but his ending dialogs was cut out.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Evil Sakura : At the character selection screen, highlight Hulk, hold Right for 5 sec. and press LP+HP or LK+HK.[CR]* Play as Evil Zanglief : At the character selection screen, highlight Blackheart, hold Left for 5 sec. and press LP+HP or LK+HK.[CR]* Play as Armored Spiderman : At the character selection screen, highlight Ryu, move down and hold Down for 5 sec. and press LP+HP or LK+HK.[CR]* Play as Mephisto : At the character selection screen, highlight Omega Red, hold Down for 5 sec. and press LP+HP or LK+HK.[CR]* Play as U.S. Agent : At the character selection screen, highlight Bison, hold Up for 5 sec. and press LP+HP or LK+HK.[CR]* Play as Shadow Charlie : At the character selection screen, highlight Dhalsim, hold Up for 5 sec. and press LP+HP or LK+HK.[CR]* Play as Gambit : Go to Dhalsim, hold Start, then move Left(x2), Down(x4), Right(x2), Up(x2), Right and press and hold LP+MK+HP together.[CR]* Play as Norimaro (Japanese version only) : Norimaro will show on the character select screen (bottom middle square) if the machine is set to Freeplay or 1 coin X credit.

[CR]Blanka (of "Street Fighter" fame) can be seen within the background in the 'Death Valley' stage. [CR]Dan's ending is an obvious parody of the ending of the SNK game, "Art of Fighting". [CR]Sunburned (or Evil) Sakura has two separate endings (Japanese version): Kei chases Gouki and Sunburned Sakura after they teleport away [CR]1) Across the entire screen from right to left. [CR]2) Across half the screen before she trips, falls, and falls asleep. [CR]There are several cameos of Rockman in this game: [CR]1) In the mall stage, there's a cameo of a Rockman cut-out (perhaps someone in a Rockman suit). And in relation to Capcom celebrating Rockman's "10th Anniversary" in 1997, they put a banner saying '10th Anniversary: Rockman'. [CR]2) In one of Norimaro's super combos, he does a cosplay of Rockman. [CR]There is one rumored reason why Iron Man was not in this game. It is because Acclaim made an Iron Man game called "Iron Man and X-O Manowar in Heavy Metal" which was released for several consoles. [CR]Firstsmile released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Marvel Super Heroes Vs.

While his true intentions of entering the competition is unknown, we can assume that it was to take pictures of Chun-Li and the many superheroes. He is voiced by the comedian Kinashi Noritake and created by Capcom as being a joke character like Dan (modeled after a Japanese comedian Noritake Kinashi). He was originally going to appear in non-Japanese versions of the game, but due to cultural differences and a reference to stealing Chun-Li's panties in his ending, he was cut out. However, his programming still exists in the ROM and he even has English dialogs in the game. He even has an ending with pictures, but his ending dialogs was cut out.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Evil Sakura : At the character selection screen, highlight Hulk, hold Right for 5 sec. and press LP+HP or LK+HK.[CR]* Play as Evil Zanglief : At the character selection screen, highlight Blackheart, hold Left for 5 sec. and press LP+HP or LK+HK.[CR]* Play as Armored Spiderman : At the character selection screen, highlight Ryu, move down and hold Down for 5 sec. and press LP+HP or LK+HK.[CR]* Play as Mephisto : At the character selection screen, highlight Omega Red, hold Down for 5 sec. and press LP+HP or LK+HK.[CR]* Play as U.S. Agent : At the character selection screen, highlight Bison, hold Up for 5 sec. and press LP+HP or LK+HK.[CR]* Play as Shadow Charlie : At the character selection screen, highlight Dhalsim, hold Up for 5 sec. and press LP+HP or LK+HK.[CR]* Play as Gambit : Go to Dhalsim, hold Start, then move Left(x2), Down(x4), Right(x2), Up(x2), Right and press and hold LP+MK+HP together.[CR]* Play as Norimaro (Japanese version only) : Norimaro will show on the character select screen (bottom middle square) if the machine is set to Freeplay or 1 coin X credit.

[CR]When they recorded the announcer's voice, she had to say both the original names and the 'Export' ones during the recording. But for some of the characters' names that were NOT changed, there were alternate pronunciations recorded.[CR]For example, when you select Chun-Li in the original Japanese version, the way the announcer pronounces 'Chun' rhymes with 'noon'. [CR]In the Export versions, the way she pronounces 'Chun' rhymes with 'fun'. There is also an unused alternate pronunciation of Zangief (which sounds like 'Zain-geef') that can be heard in the Sound Test. [CR]Megaman's 'Rock Upper' move in the original Japanese version is called 'Mega Upper' in the Export versions, simply because the name of the character is different in Japan and Worldwide.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Blue Board revisions : [CR]REVISION 1:[CR]* Build date: 971222[CR]* US release.[CR]REVISION 2:[CR]* Build date: 980112[CR]* EUROPE release.[CR]REVISION 3:[CR]* Build date: 980123[CR]* US &amp; EUROPE releases.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]Sega Dreamcast [US] (September 30, 1999) "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes [Model T-1202N]" : Re-released as Sega All Stars edition (2000)[CR]Sony PlayStation [US] (January 27, 2000) "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes [Model SLUS-01059]" [CR]Sony PlayStation [EU] (January 31, 2000) Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes [Model SLES-02305]" [CR]Sega Dreamcast [EU] (June 23, 2000) "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes [Model T-7002D-61] [CR]Sony PlayStation 3 [PSN] [US] (September 25, 2012) "Marvel vs. Capcom Origins" [CR]Microsoft XBOX 360 [XBLA] [US] [EU] [AU] (September 26, 2012) "Marvel vs. Capcom Origins" [CR]Sony PlayStation 3 [PSN] [EU] (October 10, 2012) "Marvel vs. Capcom Origins"[CR]</plot>

[CR]Megaman's ending is a reference to what happens in his own games ("Mega Man - The Power Battle") when he beats a boss. [CR]Captain Commando's ending is a reference to the ending in his own game ("Captain Commando"). [CR]Rumors exist for the reason War Machine was in the roster instead of Iron Man (although Hyper-Armor War Machine in the game had similar moves with Iron Man). The most popular reason being that Capcom, at the time, did not have the rights to use the Iron Man character. [CR]The game background is mainly inspired by the famous comic saga called Onslaught, published in 1996. As in the comic books, Onslaught appears under his two main forms (after defeating the first one, he reveals its ultimate appearance). [CR]Shirley Burton holds the official record for this game with 1119300 points. [CR]Suleputer released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Marvel Vs. Capcom OST - CPCA-1005) on March 21, 1998. [CR]Michael Jackson used to own this game.

				<title_clean>Pocket Fighter</title_clean>
				<plot>Pocket Fighter (c) 1997 Capcom.[CR]A superb, abstract and humorous fighting game featuring miniaturized renditions from several Capcom fighting games; including the legendary "Street Fighter" series, as well as "Darkstalkers" and the little-known "Red Earth".[CR]During a bout, players will be able to release coloured gems from successful attacks against their opponent, as well as from wooden chests that regularly appear. Collecting these gems will 'power-up' the player's character, giving them more powerful attacks. There are two bars and three sub-bars in the interface. The two main bars are the life bar and the super bar; the first indicates the player's health and the second their ability to throw super combos. The Super Bar itself can be filled up to nine levels, allowing players to execute more super combos. Each super combo has a level assigned to it, and it uses Super Bars depending on it.[CR]The 3 sub-bars show the level of 3 of each player's special moves. Each character has at least three special moves, as shown in the sub-bars, and each of these corresponds to a color. Some characters have one or two additional Special Moves that aren't affected by sub-bars. Each time a player shoots their opponent, gems pop out of him or her, and the attacker can take them to power up their own special moves according to the colors.[CR]There are 4 buttons : PUNCH, KICK, SPECIAL, and TAUNT. The Special button is a chargeable move that cannot be blocked and upon impact drops gems in the opponent's possession. More gems will be dropped depending on how much the player charges the attack. Holding Down, Forward or no direction at all when using the Special button will cause a specific gem color to drop from the enemy. Holding Back along with the Special button allows for a defense that is specific against the unblockable Special attacks. Other kinds of attacks do no damage when blocked, and unlike most 2-D fighting games, this includes special and super moves.[CR]Pocket Fighter also features Flash Combos in which a player can execute a combo by pressing the KICK or PUNCH button after they have hit their opponent using the PUNCH button for a total of 4 hits. Flash Combos will usually cause a player's fighter (except Ryu) to change into various costumes during the sequence, and perform a powerful attack in the end. This final hit is usually the hardest in the sequence to connect with. These costumes range from uniforms (such as traffic cops or schoolgirls), to swimsuits, and even cameos of other Capcom characters. For example, Chun-Li may turn into Jill Valentine from the Resident Evil series, while Felicia may turn into Mega Man or other Darkstalkers characters not playable in the game.[CR]The commands are also very easy compared to the Street Fighter series, thanks to SPECIAL button. By doing a motion (for example : qcf or hcf) and pressing the Special Button the fighter will launch his or her super combo.[CR]In addition to the usual punches, kicks and fireballs, each character has a couple of very abstract yet powerful 'special' attacks; which can range from the player producing a huge mallet (Ken), to standing on a podium and motioning a bicycle race through the opposing fighter (Chun Li).[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Green Board [Japan][CR]Players: Up to 2.[CR]Control: 8-way joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 3 per player.[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Pocket Fighter was released in September 1997 in the Japanese arcades. It was known as the 25th video game released for the CPS-II hardware.[CR]It was known outside Japan as Super Gem Fighter. Here is a list of known Export releases:[CR]"Super Gem Fighter - Mini Mix [Blue Board]"[CR]"Super Gem Fighter - Mini Mix [Grey Board]"[CR]"Super Gem Fighter - Mini Mix [Orange Board]"[CR]Many elements of the game come from "Super Puzzle Fighter 2 X" (basically gems and sounds).[CR]When you talk about cameos in fighting games, this game is way packed in this category! Here are some famous ones :[CR]Felicia : Can disguise herself as Megaman ("Mega Man - The Power Battle"), Rikuo / Sasquatch / Huitzil ("Darkstalkers - The Night Warriors"), Gamof &amp; Rimgal ("Star Gladiator - Episode : I Final Crusade").[CR]Ibuki : Among her costumes are Rolento (Street Fighter Zero) and Chaka ("Jojo's Bizarre Adventure").[CR]Chun Li : She disguises herself as Jun May Williams ("Star Gladiator - Episode : I Final Crusade") &amp; Jill Valentine ("Resident Evil").[CR]Gouki : He disguises himself as Leo ("Warzard").[CR]Also when performing his Shun Goku Satsu the old way (Punch, Punch, Towards, Kick, Special) he parodies Guy's Musou Renge Super Combo! ("Street Fighter Zero").[CR]Lord Raptor's graveyard makes a cameo in Gouki's ending![CR]Ken : Some disguises are a soccer player ("Capcom Sports Club") and Hol Horse ("Jojo's Bizarre Adventure").[CR]Tessa : In one of her costumes she disguises as Midler ("Jojo's Bizarre adventure").[CR]Also when she is low on energy and she blocks an attack she summons Pao ("Warzard") and uses her as a living shield!. :([CR]Morrigan : When performing her 'Darkness Ilussion' she summons her kid sister Lillith ("Vampire Savior - The Lord Of Vampire").[CR]Hauzer : The huge monster who appears on Ryu's ending is a boss character in "Warzard".[CR]Zanglief : His Leaping Bite super combo actually happens to be a parody of Birdie's Murder Chain super combo (However Zangief modifies the second part of the move by biting the opponent instead of slamming them on the ground as Birdie does!).[CR]The 'Capsy' soft drink (seen in Felicia's ending) is a parody of the Pepsi cola!. :)[CR]Additionally you can find lots of famous Capcom characters on the game's backgrounds, some of these are :[CR]Blanka, Dhalsim &amp; his wife Sari, E. Honda, M. Bison, Cammy, Fei Long, Guile, Charlie, Vega, Dee Jay, Birdie, Gen, Sodom, Guy &amp; Rolento (Street Fighter games).[CR]Rikuo &amp; Riki, Victor, Bishamon, Jon Talbain, Hsien Ko (disguised as Santa Claus!), Sasquatch, Demitri, Jedah (as a woman!), Donovan &amp; Anita, Baby Bonnie Hood, Lin lin (in the game's logo!) &amp; Huitzil (Darkstalkers/Vampire Savior games).[CR]Chris Redfield (looking quite pale &amp; angry!), the giant snake boss (that is trying to gobble up Rikuo!) &amp; a few zombies! (Resident Evil games).[CR]Helena ("Street Fighter III - New Generation").[CR]Vampire Mistress in Red Dress (seen in Demitri's stage in "Vampire Savior - The Lord Of Vampire").[CR]Demitri's girlfriends (seen in his own stage as well as in his ending in Darkstalkers &amp; Nightwarriors games).[CR]Jun May Williams &amp; Rimgal ("Star Gladiator - Episode : I Final Crusade").[CR]Don Tacos ("Pang! 3").[CR]Pao &amp; Leo ("Warzard").[CR]Son Gokuu ("Son Son").[CR]All of the death scenes that occur when a character is defeated are taken from famous old games, such as "Son Son"'s 'splash down the drain' or the famous "Final Fight" / "Double Dragon" 'blink-out'.[CR]The long-nosed karate character bearing a halo that appears with Dan during certain moves is Dan's father who was killed by Sagat. The long-nosed karate fighter is a hilarious parody of Mr. Karate, aka Takuma Sakazaki of the AOF/KOF series, who wore a long-nosed Tengu mask in the original "Art of Fighting" when disguised as the final boss.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Gouki : at the character select screen, highlight Ryu and press Left.[CR]* Play as Dan : at the character select screen, highlight Ken and press Right.[CR]* Alternate ending : after beating the game, hold the 'Special' button before the credits appear to listen an alternate ending tune (Note : This trick works only in the Japanese version).[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Object designers : Ino, Nishimura Masaru, Yorio, Shigeyama, Ohsumi Tomohiko, Mayano, Kimikimo &amp; Sema, Iwasaki, Ikusan Z, Kitasan, Rumichan, Tamura Chizuko[CR]Scroll designers : Takako Nakamura, Hiroki Ohnishi, Ojiji, Hirokazu Yonezuka, Yoichi Tanoue, R.Uno[CR]Character Designers : Edayan, I.Yamazaki, Jiwasaki, Sakomizu, Babatin, Uka-Bin[CR]Music composers &amp; Arrangement : Isao Abe, Yuki Iwai, Setsuo Yamamoto[CR]Sound designers : Satoshi Ise, Ryoji, Hiroshi Ohno[CR]Programmers : Knight Rider Giu, Senor, Pon, Ittetsu, Shinchan (as 'Hyper Shinchan'), Minomiya, Cham Cho Choy, Hard.Yas (- Enemy -), Team Dirty Beret[CR]Game designers : Spp Iorya, Muraski Umagoyashi, Burns Fuji, Ohashi Mamoru, Team Sadogatake[CR]Producer : Takashi Sado[CR]General producer : Noritaka Funamizu[CR]Executive producer : Yoshiki Okamoto [CR]Voice Actors : [CR]Ibuki : Amano Yuri[CR]Felicia : Araki Kae[CR]Tessa : Ishii Naoko[CR]Ken Masters : Tetsuya Iwanaga[CR]Sakura Kasugano : Sasamoto Yuko[CR]Morrigan : Jinguji Yayoi[CR]Zangief : Takagi Wataru[CR]Akuma : Tomomichi Nishimura[CR]Hsien-Ko : Neya Michiko[CR]Ryu : Hoshi Souichiro[CR]Dan Hibiki : Hosoi Osamu[CR]Chun-Li : Miyamura Yuko[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles : [CR]Sony PlayStation [JP] (June 11, 1998) [Model SLPS-01360] [CR]Sony PlayStation [JP] (February 24, 2000) PS The Best edition [Model SLPS-91191]") [CR]Sega Saturn [JP] (July 9, 1998) [Model T-1230G] [CR]Bandai WonderSwan [JP] (April 6, 2000) [Model SWJ-BAN00A] [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [JP] (May 25, 2006) "Street Fighter Zero Fighter's Generation" [Model SLPM-66409] [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [JP] (November 15, 2007) "Street Fighter Zero Fighter's Generation [Best Price]" [Model SLPM-66854][CR]Sony PlayStation 3 [PSOne Classics] [JP] (April 13, 2011)[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Progear no Arashi (c) 2001 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]In a time when the industrialization of the world had just begun, various inventions appeared and changed the life of the peaceful kingdom. One of them was a propeller that evolved from pure wind generation by using the created electricity to re-rotate it. It was called 'The Professional Gear', or just 'Progear'. This invention was the key to conquer the great wide open sky. Another discovery made the ancient dream of the immortal body come true. But it was affordable only by some wealthy elderly. They formed a new council called 'the Motorouin' and declared the current government as a corruptive and greedy establishment and that they want to correct it by a new educational system, in order to create a new race of man. So they built a military force to realize the first step of their plan, which was the takeover of the kingdom. The government decided to stop the aggression by putting it's own army in motion. It was a dreadful battle with many victims. But it was won by the Motorouin. This battle is mentioned in the books of history as 'The Punishment of the Sages'.[CR]A group of young pilots, actually children whose families were killed in that war, finally decided to fight back. They secretly developed a new powerful weapon which adults were not able to use. They called it 'Gun Flyer' and installed it in all of their planes. The Storm of Progear was about to begin![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Green Board [Japan][CR]Players: Up to 2.[CR]Control: 8-way joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 2 per player.[CR]=&gt; [1] Shot/Gunner shot, [2] Bomb[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Progear no Arashi was released in January 2001 in the Japanese arcades.

				<plot>Progear no Arashi (c) 2001 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]In a time when the industrialization of the world had just begun, various inventions appeared and changed the life of the peaceful kingdom. One of them was a propeller that evolved from pure wind generation by using the created electricity to re-rotate it. It was called 'The Professional Gear', or just 'Progear'. This invention was the key to conquer the great wide open sky. Another discovery made the ancient dream of the immortal body come true. But it was affordable only by some wealthy elderly. They formed a new council called 'the Motorouin' and declared the current government as a corruptive and greedy establishment and that they want to correct it by a new educational system, in order to create a new race of man. So they built a military force to realize the first step of their plan, which was the takeover of the kingdom. The government decided to stop the aggression by putting it's own army in motion. It was a dreadful battle with many victims. But it was won by the Motorouin. This battle is mentioned in the books of history as 'The Punishment of the Sages'.[CR]A group of young pilots, actually children whose families were killed in that war, finally decided to fight back. They secretly developed a new powerful weapon which adults were not able to use. They called it 'Gun Flyer' and installed it in all of their planes.

				<plot>Street Fighter Zero 2 (c) 1996 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]Eighteen fighters go head-to-head this time around, featuring a few "Final Fight" alumni.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Green Board [Japan][CR]Players: Up to 2.[CR]Control: 8-way joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 6 per player.[CR]= &gt; [1] LP, [2] MP, [3] HP[CR]= &gt; [4] LK, [5] MK, [6] HK[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Street Fighter Zero 2 was released in February 1996 in the Japanese arcades. It was known there as the 15th video game released for the CPS2 hardware.[CR]Known Export releases:[CR]"Street Fighter Alpha 2 [Blue Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Zero 2 [Grey Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Zero 2 [Orange Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Zero 2 [Pink Board]"[CR]Guy, Rolento and Sodom are from Capcom's "Final Fight" - Guy as a selectable character, Sodom as the second boss, and Rolento as the fourth boss. Guy's and Rolento's music are taken from "Final Fight". [CR]In Guy's stage you will see many familiar faces from "Final Fight". There's Mike and Jessica Haggar, Cody, Poison, Andorre and a few other bosses in the background - most of the "Final Fight" characters that have gone on to other games are there. [CR]In Rose's battle location there are represented the 'gondole', the typical elements of another and more famous Italian sea-town, Venice. This is clearly wrong cultural knowledge by Capcom's programmers. [CR]Here is a list of cameos in Ken's Yacht stage : [CR]* Eliza (It's her birthday after all!) [CR]* Captain Commando &amp; Sho [CR]* Strider Hiryu (wielding a teddy bear!) [CR]* Lynn Kurosawa (from Alien Vs Predator) [CR]* Morrigan, Felicia, Zabel Zarock ('Lord Raptor' outside Japan) &amp; Lei-Lei ('Hsien-Ko' outside Japan) (these last two are pretty much alive in this cameo, unlike in the Vampire &amp; Vampire Savior games!) :) [CR]* Michelle Heart (from "Ares no Tsubasa" as another waitress!) [CR]* A few thugs from "Final Fight" (working as waiters?!) [CR]Dan Hibiki, the pink-clad Shotokan fighter, was an attempt by Capcom to make fun of SNK fighting games. Ryo Sakazaki was thought to be so much like Ryu that Capcom had to make a statement. Dan is mainly a hybrid of Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia from the "Art of Fighting" series. This is most evident in his appearance in which he has Robert Garcia's trademark pony tail and Ryo Sakazaki's black undershirt. His animations were heavily tailored to look like a take on the aforemetioned characters. Dan's father was killed by Sagat (This is the man who Sagat hits with a Tiger Uppercut during the Ryu vs. Sagat intro in "Street Fighter Alpha 3"), so Dan developed his own style of fighting called 'Saikyo-ryuu', which is Japanese for 'strongest style', a poke at the "Art of Fighting" 'Kyokugen' karate style ('Kyokugen" is Japanese for 'extreme'). Fei Long makes a guest appearance in Dan's stage. [CR]The sumo wrestler 'Fujinoyama' that Sodom challenges in his ending had so much of a resemblance to E. Honda that Capcom, for "Street Fighter Alpha 3", changed it to E. Honda. [CR]The Australian prairie stage where Sagat fights Ryu is based on the opening scene of the animated 'Street Fighter II Movie', in which Ryu and Sagat fight in a prairie during a thunderstorm. [CR]Victor Entertainment released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Street Fighter Zero 2 : Capcom Game Soundtrack - VIZL-24) on June 21, 1996.[CR]After the first release of SFZ2, an upgraded version of the game called "Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha" was released in Japanese arcades in August 1996, and to home consoles in North America and Europe in 1997. It included some enhancements like new moves, a unique variation of Sakura, the survival mode, the dramatic battle and the player was able to fight with Zangief, Dhalsim and 'Satsui no Hadou Mezameta Ryu' (Evil Ryu).[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Green Board revisions:[CR]REVISION 1:[CR]* Buid date: 060227[CR]REVISION 2:[CR]* Buid date: 960430[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Alternate Costume Colors : Highlight a fighter at the character selection screen and press punch or kick for the two standard outfits (punch is the original color). For two alternative outfits press two punch or two kick buttons together. [CR]* Alternate Chun-Li Costumes : Hold Start and highlight Chun-Li at the character selection screen. After five seconds, press LP, MP, or HP for a blue costume (without trousers); press LP+MP+HP for a pink costume. [CR]* Play as Satsui no Hadou ni Mezameta Ryu (translated as 'Ryu in which the surge of the intent to kill has awakened'; known as 'Evil Ryu' in Export releases) : Highlight Ryu at the character selection screen, then press Start for one second. Then highlight Adon, Gouki, Adon, then return to Ryu. Then hold Start for one second, while holding start press any attack button. [CR]* Grass Stage : Select two-player mode. Hold Start at the character selection screen, then highlight Sagat for five seconds. Then highlight any character, release Start and press any attack button. [CR]* Waterfall Stage : Select two-player mode. Hold Start at the character selection screen, then highlight Vega for five seconds. Then highlight any character, release Start and press any attack button. [CR]* Sari in Every Stage : In Dhalsim's stage you may have noticed a girl who cheers for him. That is Sari, his wife. When you play as Dhalsim, its possible to make her appear on every fight by holding down LP+HK before the fight starts (You must do this at the beginning of every round). [CR]* Alternate Sodom Stage : An alternate version of Sodom's stage appears every 4096 matches. The artwork on his truck is different. The Japanese text is replaced with English and the man on the side of the trailer is now wearing sunglasses. This alternate version of the stage is the one used in "Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha". [CR]* Fight against Shin Gouki : It only works with the character's first color (meaning the original color). Fight through the game without losing a single round. Get at least three perfect wins and three super special finishes. Shin Gouki appears as your last boss now.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Street Fighter (1987)[CR]2.

				<plot>Street Fighter Zero 2 (c) 1996 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]Eighteen fighters go head-to-head this time around, featuring a few "Final Fight" alumni.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Green Board [Japan][CR]Players: Up to 2.[CR]Control: 8-way joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 6 per player.[CR]= &gt; [1] LP, [2] MP, [3] HP[CR]= &gt; [4] LK, [5] MK, [6] HK[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Street Fighter Zero 2 was released in February 1996 in the Japanese arcades. It was known there as the 15th video game released for the CPS2 hardware.[CR]Known Export releases:[CR]"Street Fighter Alpha 2 [Blue Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Zero 2 [Grey Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Zero 2 [Orange Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Zero 2 [Pink Board]"[CR]Guy, Rolento and Sodom are from Capcom's "Final Fight" - Guy as a selectable character, Sodom as the second boss, and Rolento as the fourth boss. Guy's and Rolento's music are taken from "Final Fight". [CR]In Guy's stage you will see many familiar faces from "Final Fight". There's Mike and Jessica Haggar, Cody, Poison, Andorre and a few other bosses in the background - most of the "Final Fight" characters that have gone on to other games are there. [CR]In Rose's battle location there are represented the 'gondole', the typical elements of another and more famous Italian sea-town, Venice. This is clearly wrong cultural knowledge by Capcom's programmers. [CR]Here is a list of cameos in Ken's Yacht stage : [CR]* Eliza (It's her birthday after all!) [CR]* Captain Commando &amp; Sho [CR]* Strider Hiryu (wielding a teddy bear!) [CR]* Lynn Kurosawa (from Alien Vs Predator) [CR]* Morrigan, Felicia, Zabel Zarock ('Lord Raptor' outside Japan) &amp; Lei-Lei ('Hsien-Ko' outside Japan) (these last two are pretty much alive in this cameo, unlike in the Vampire &amp; Vampire Savior games!) :) [CR]* Michelle Heart (from "Ares no Tsubasa" as another waitress!) [CR]* A few thugs from "Final Fight" (working as waiters?!) [CR]Dan Hibiki, the pink-clad Shotokan fighter, was an attempt by Capcom to make fun of SNK fighting games. Ryo Sakazaki was thought to be so much like Ryu that Capcom had to make a statement. Dan is mainly a hybrid of Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia from the "Art of Fighting" series. This is most evident in his appearance in which he has Robert Garcia's trademark pony tail and Ryo Sakazaki's black undershirt. His animations were heavily tailored to look like a take on the aforemetioned characters. Dan's father was killed by Sagat (This is the man who Sagat hits with a Tiger Uppercut during the Ryu vs. Sagat intro in "Street Fighter Alpha 3"), so Dan developed his own style of fighting called 'Saikyo-ryuu', which is Japanese for 'strongest style', a poke at the "Art of Fighting" 'Kyokugen' karate style ('Kyokugen" is Japanese for 'extreme'). Fei Long makes a guest appearance in Dan's stage. [CR]The sumo wrestler 'Fujinoyama' that Sodom challenges in his ending had so much of a resemblance to E. Honda that Capcom, for "Street Fighter Alpha 3", changed it to E. Honda. [CR]The Australian prairie stage where Sagat fights Ryu is based on the opening scene of the animated 'Street Fighter II Movie', in which Ryu and Sagat fight in a prairie during a thunderstorm. [CR]Victor Entertainment released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Street Fighter Zero 2 : Capcom Game Soundtrack - VIZL-24) on June 21, 1996.[CR]After the first release of SFZ2, an upgraded version of the game called "Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha" was released in Japanese arcades in August 1996, and to home consoles in North America and Europe in 1997. It included some enhancements like new moves, a unique variation of Sakura, the survival mode, the dramatic battle and the player was able to fight with Zangief, Dhalsim and 'Satsui no Hadou Mezameta Ryu' (Evil Ryu).[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Green Board revisions:[CR]REVISION 1:[CR]* Buid date: 060227[CR]REVISION 2:[CR]* Buid date: 960430[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Alternate Costume Colors : Highlight a fighter at the character selection screen and press punch or kick for the two standard outfits (punch is the original color). For two alternative outfits press two punch or two kick buttons together. [CR]* Alternate Chun-Li Costumes : Hold Start and highlight Chun-Li at the character selection screen. After five seconds, press LP, MP, or HP for a blue costume (without trousers); press LP+MP+HP for a pink costume. [CR]* Play as Satsui no Hadou ni Mezameta Ryu (translated as 'Ryu in which the surge of the intent to kill has awakened'; known as 'Evil Ryu' in Export releases) : Highlight Ryu at the character selection screen, then press Start for one second. Then highlight Adon, Gouki, Adon, then return to Ryu. Then hold Start for one second, while holding start press any attack button. [CR]* Grass Stage : Select two-player mode. Hold Start at the character selection screen, then highlight Sagat for five seconds. Then highlight any character, release Start and press any attack button. [CR]* Waterfall Stage : Select two-player mode. Hold Start at the character selection screen, then highlight Vega for five seconds. Then highlight any character, release Start and press any attack button. [CR]* Sari in Every Stage : In Dhalsim's stage you may have noticed a girl who cheers for him. That is Sari, his wife. When you play as Dhalsim, its possible to make her appear on every fight by holding down LP+HK before the fight starts (You must do this at the beginning of every round). [CR]* Alternate Sodom Stage : An alternate version of Sodom's stage appears every 4096 matches. The artwork on his truck is different. The Japanese text is replaced with English and the man on the side of the trailer is now wearing sunglasses. This alternate version of the stage is the one used in "Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha". [CR]* Fight against Shin Gouki : It only works with the character's first color (meaning the original color). Fight through the game without losing a single round. Get at least three perfect wins and three super special finishes. Shin Gouki appears as your last boss now.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Street Fighter (1987)[CR]2.

				<plot>Street Fighter Zero 2 (c) 1996 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]Eighteen fighters go head-to-head this time around, featuring a few "Final Fight" alumni.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Green Board [Japan][CR]Players: Up to 2.[CR]Control: 8-way joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 6 per player.[CR]= &gt; [1] LP, [2] MP, [3] HP[CR]= &gt; [4] LK, [5] MK, [6] HK[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Street Fighter Zero 2 was released in February 1996 in the Japanese arcades. It was known there as the 15th video game released for the CPS2 hardware.[CR]Known Export releases:[CR]"Street Fighter Alpha 2 [Blue Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Zero 2 [Grey Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Zero 2 [Orange Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Zero 2 [Pink Board]"[CR]Guy, Rolento and Sodom are from Capcom's "Final Fight" - Guy as a selectable character, Sodom as the second boss, and Rolento as the fourth boss. Guy's and Rolento's music are taken from "Final Fight". [CR]In Guy's stage you will see many familiar faces from "Final Fight". There's Mike and Jessica Haggar, Cody, Poison, Andorre and a few other bosses in the background - most of the "Final Fight" characters that have gone on to other games are there. [CR]In Rose's battle location there are represented the 'gondole', the typical elements of another and more famous Italian sea-town, Venice. This is clearly wrong cultural knowledge by Capcom's programmers. [CR]Here is a list of cameos in Ken's Yacht stage : [CR]* Eliza (It's her birthday after all!) [CR]* Captain Commando &amp; Sho [CR]* Strider Hiryu (wielding a teddy bear!) [CR]* Lynn Kurosawa (from Alien Vs Predator) [CR]* Morrigan, Felicia, Zabel Zarock ('Lord Raptor' outside Japan) &amp; Lei-Lei ('Hsien-Ko' outside Japan) (these last two are pretty much alive in this cameo, unlike in the Vampire &amp; Vampire Savior games!) :) [CR]* Michelle Heart (from "Ares no Tsubasa" as another waitress!) [CR]* A few thugs from "Final Fight" (working as waiters?!) [CR]Dan Hibiki, the pink-clad Shotokan fighter, was an attempt by Capcom to make fun of SNK fighting games. Ryo Sakazaki was thought to be so much like Ryu that Capcom had to make a statement. Dan is mainly a hybrid of Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia from the "Art of Fighting" series. This is most evident in his appearance in which he has Robert Garcia's trademark pony tail and Ryo Sakazaki's black undershirt. His animations were heavily tailored to look like a take on the aforemetioned characters. Dan's father was killed by Sagat (This is the man who Sagat hits with a Tiger Uppercut during the Ryu vs. Sagat intro in "Street Fighter Alpha 3"), so Dan developed his own style of fighting called 'Saikyo-ryuu', which is Japanese for 'strongest style', a poke at the "Art of Fighting" 'Kyokugen' karate style ('Kyokugen" is Japanese for 'extreme'). Fei Long makes a guest appearance in Dan's stage. [CR]The sumo wrestler 'Fujinoyama' that Sodom challenges in his ending had so much of a resemblance to E. Honda that Capcom, for "Street Fighter Alpha 3", changed it to E. Honda. [CR]The Australian prairie stage where Sagat fights Ryu is based on the opening scene of the animated 'Street Fighter II Movie', in which Ryu and Sagat fight in a prairie during a thunderstorm. [CR]Victor Entertainment released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Street Fighter Zero 2 : Capcom Game Soundtrack - VIZL-24) on June 21, 1996.[CR]After the first release of SFZ2, an upgraded version of the game called "Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha" was released in Japanese arcades in August 1996, and to home consoles in North America and Europe in 1997. It included some enhancements like new moves, a unique variation of Sakura, the survival mode, the dramatic battle and the player was able to fight with Zangief, Dhalsim and 'Satsui no Hadou Mezameta Ryu' (Evil Ryu).[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Green Board revisions:[CR]REVISION 1:[CR]* Buid date: 060227[CR]REVISION 2:[CR]* Buid date: 960430[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Alternate Costume Colors : Highlight a fighter at the character selection screen and press punch or kick for the two standard outfits (punch is the original color). For two alternative outfits press two punch or two kick buttons together. [CR]* Alternate Chun-Li Costumes : Hold Start and highlight Chun-Li at the character selection screen. After five seconds, press LP, MP, or HP for a blue costume (without trousers); press LP+MP+HP for a pink costume. [CR]* Play as Satsui no Hadou ni Mezameta Ryu (translated as 'Ryu in which the surge of the intent to kill has awakened'; known as 'Evil Ryu' in Export releases) : Highlight Ryu at the character selection screen, then press Start for one second. Then highlight Adon, Gouki, Adon, then return to Ryu. Then hold Start for one second, while holding start press any attack button. [CR]* Grass Stage : Select two-player mode. Hold Start at the character selection screen, then highlight Sagat for five seconds. Then highlight any character, release Start and press any attack button. [CR]* Waterfall Stage : Select two-player mode. Hold Start at the character selection screen, then highlight Vega for five seconds. Then highlight any character, release Start and press any attack button. [CR]* Sari in Every Stage : In Dhalsim's stage you may have noticed a girl who cheers for him. That is Sari, his wife. When you play as Dhalsim, its possible to make her appear on every fight by holding down LP+HK before the fight starts (You must do this at the beginning of every round). [CR]* Alternate Sodom Stage : An alternate version of Sodom's stage appears every 4096 matches. The artwork on his truck is different. The Japanese text is replaced with English and the man on the side of the trailer is now wearing sunglasses. This alternate version of the stage is the one used in "Street Fighter Zero 2 Alpha". [CR]* Fight against Shin Gouki : It only works with the character's first color (meaning the original color). Fight through the game without losing a single round. Get at least three perfect wins and three super special finishes. Shin Gouki appears as your last boss now.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Street Fighter (1987)[CR]2.

				<plot>Street Fighter Zero 3 (c) 1998 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]25 fighters mix it up to have a shot at Shin Vega in the height of his power! Featuring 3 fighting styles for each character.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Green Board [Japan][CR]Players: Up to 2.[CR]Control: 8-way joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 6 per player.[CR]= &gt; [1] LP, [2] MP, [3] HP[CR]= &gt; [4] LK, [5] MK, [6] HK[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Street Fighter Zero 3 was released in June 1998 in the Japananese arcades. It was known as the 29th video game released on the CPS2 hardware.[CR]Known export releases:[CR]"Street Fighter Alpha 3 [Blue Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Zero 3 [Grey Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Alpha 3 [Orange Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Alpha 3 [Pink Board]"[CR]Guy, Cody, Sodom and Rolento are from Capcom's "Final Fight" - Guy and Cody as selectable characters, Sodom as the second boss and Rolento as the fourth boss in "Final Fight". "Final Fight" boss 'Edi E' makes appearances in some of Cody's finishing poses.[CR]The reason for Mike Haggar's (the third selectable character in "Final Fight") non-appearance in Street Fighter was that he was too similar to Zangief. Furthermore, it could be because during the "Street Fighter Zero" storyline, Mike Haggar was assumed to be the mayor of Metro City (a part of New York) at the time. [CR]In Guy's stage there is a group from "Final Fight" cheering Guy on. They consist of: Mike Haggar, Andorre Jr., Axl and poison. Also in the background against one of the buildings there is a advert for a Rockman Drink just under the Capcom Logo. [CR]Karin Kanzuki is the first Street Fighter to have originated from a comic book (actually, a manga). She first appeared in a girls' manga that had Sakura Kasugano as the main character. [CR]The three ISMs have some symbolic meaning : [CR]* X-ISM represents "Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge". That is, this ISM matches closely to the gameplay style found therein. There are, however, a few differences between X-ISM in Zero 3 and Super Street Fighter II X, mainly because of the Zero 3 game engine. [CR]* Z-ISM represents Zero. That is, it is closest to the style of the previous Zero games. [CR]* V-ISM represents Variable, as in 'Variable Combination', meaning 'Custom Combo'. This merely represents how you can use your super bar. [CR]Even though "Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge" is known as "Super Street Fighter II Turbo" outside Japan, X-ISM is still known as X-ISM in all export releases of Zero 3.[CR]Attack of the Vega Dolls: Each Vega doll is named after a month of the year in the language of their supposed origin. It is said that they wield different tools, but generally share the same style. It is said that they generally worked as a team. [CR]1) Enero (January) from Spain uses a microphone. [CR]2) Fevrier (February) from France uses a gun. [CR]3) Marz (March) from Germany uses a laptop and dyes her hair. Enero and Marz are the information and recon members of the team. [CR]4) Aprile (April) from Italy is the medical member of the team. At the beginning of SFA3, Aprile's brother had asked Rose to find her whereabouts. [CR]5) Satsuki (May) is Japanese and wields a sword. Some say Sakura was supposed to be kidnapped instead of Satsuki, but Sakura evaded capture. This belief is consistent with the fact that all 12 dolls (and Cammy) were 16 at the time of SFA3. [CR]6) Juni (June) is German and fights unarmed. [CR]7) Juli (July) is also German and also fights unarmed. Despite the claims of some sources, Juni and Juli are not related (none of the Bison dolls are). [CR]8) Santamu (August) is Vietnamese, but of African heritage. SANTAMU is the equivalent of Vietnamese's 8th month. However, the Vietnamese's spelling should be 'Thang Tam'. It's a compound word of 'month' &amp; 'eight', obviously. She wields a spear and can also unleash a small monkey to attack for her. [CR]9) Xiayu (September) is Chinese and wields the nunchaku. [CR]10) Jianyu (October) is also Chinese and wields a staff. [CR]11) Noembelu (November) is Mexican and is a member of T. Hawk's tribe (thus T. Hawk was looking for her and not Juli as the story implied). She wields a pair of hatchets on ropes. [CR]12) Decapre (December) is Russian and her appearance is similar to that of Cammy. [CR]Cammy had tried to save the Vega dolls in her SFZ3 ending because, due to the extent of their brainwashing, they would have died with Vega otherwise. It is said that the inspiration of the Vega dolls was Yuka Minakawa's novels named collectively as 'Cammy History'. Before the fight, Cammy throws a red coat, this comes from Street Fighter 2 the Animated Movie. [CR]Various characters of the game make a cameo in a marvel comic-book of Deadpool, the Merc with a mouth, vol.1 number 8. They appear in the shadows like mercenaries of the infernal house, the place where Deadpool obtains his merc jobs. We can recognize Adon, Dhalsim and Akuma as shadows, Sagat appears drawn and coloured. There are two more fighters, one appears to be Cammy. The artist of this Deadpool issue is Ed McGuiness. [CR]In number 27 of Deadpool's comic, the author Joe Kelly, makes a homage to the Street Fighter series. In this comic Deadpool does a "Shoryuken" to Kitty Pride to make Wolverine attack him. [CR]Suleputer released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Street Fighter Zero 3 Original Soundtrack - CPCA-1012, 1013) on September 21, 1998.[CR]An upgraded version of SFZ3 appeared as "Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper" in 2001. Previously hidden characters M. Bison, Juni and Juli are playable from the start. In addition, past Street Fighter legends Guile, Dee Jay, Fei Long and T. Hawk are now playable as well. This brings the total count to 34 playable characters! [CR]An even further upgraded version of SFZ3, called "Street Fighter Zero 3 Double Upper" appeared for the Sony PSP in 2006, and adds Eagle (from the original Street Fighter), Yun (from SFIII), Maki (from the Super Famicom Final Fight 2) and newcomer Ingrid. This now brings the total count of playable characters to 38![CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Green Board revisions : [CR]REVISION 1:[CR]* Build date: 980629[CR]REVISION 2:[CR]* Build date: 980727[CR]REVISION 3:[CR]* Build date: 980904[CR]Revision 1 had two bugs involving Karin : First, she could do her Kanzuki-ryuu Kou'ou Ken super in X-ISM (which she shouldn't be able to do, as it was her second super). Second, Karin's normal throw in Mazi Mode could do 99% damage.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Title Color Chart : The color of the title screen denotes what secrets are currently available. After a few weeks of play, the title screen will change color, so in a few months after your SFZ3 machine has been installed, it should reach the final color (light blue). The explanation of the colors is shown below :[CR]Cream - (default color)[CR]Green - Classical Mode[CR]Red - M. Bison, Juni and Juli become playable[CR]Dark Blue - Mazi Mode[CR]Purple - Saikyou Mode[CR]Light Blue - Can select one of the three Battle Modes[CR]* Random Select : The Random Select squares are normally invisible. But, there are two for the first player and two for the second. The 1P squares are located in the upper-right corner of the diamond and the lower-right. The 2P squares are in the upper-left corner and the lower-left corners.[CR]* Hidden Characters : The three hidden charactes are M. Bison, the boxer and Juni and Juli, two prototype 'dolls' created by Vega's Shadowloo organization. Once the game's title screen has become the proper color (see 'Title Color Chart', above), their score listing will show up in the High Score listing and they become playable...[CR]1) To choose M. Bison, pause on Karin for five seconds, then move to any Random Select square, hold the Start button and press any button.[CR]2) To use Juli, pause on Karin for five seconds, then move to any Random Select square. If the square is on the left side of the screen, choose her by holding Left and pressing any button. If the square is on the right side, then hold Right and press any button instead.[CR]3) To use Juni, pause on Karin for five seconds, then move to any Random Select square. If the square is on the top of the screen, choose her by holding Up and pressing any button. If the square is on the bottom, then hold Down and press any button instead.[CR]* Hidden Modes Of Play : There are three secret modes that affect basic gameplay. Once the game's title screen has become the proper color (see 'Title Color Chart', above), you can select a hidden mode to use...[CR]1) To use Classical Mode, insert your coin, hold down HP+HK and press Start. You can release HP+HK once you're at the Player Select Screen. Then, pick your character. When you start the round your super power bar will be gone and you will have Street Fighter 2 moves.[CR]2) To use Mazi Mode, insert your coin, hold down MP+MK and press Start. You can release HP+HK once you're at the Player Select Screen. Then, pick your character.[CR]3) To use Saikyou Mode, insert your coin, hold down LP+LK and press Start. You can release HP+HK once you're at the Player Select Screen. Then, pick your character.[CR]* Hidden Battle Mode : Once the game's title screen has become the proper color (see 'Title Color Chart', above), you can select a hidden battle mode...[CR]1) Final battle mode : After picking your ISM, hold Start+LP+MK+HP. You'll fight Shin Vega for one battle only. It's just like the last battle; win and you get your ending, lose and you get the bad ending.[CR]2) Dramatic battle mode : Hold LK+MK+HK, then press Start. Keep holding those buttons at Player Select Screen for a moment. You'll fight a 2 on 1 battle for 6 rounds, in which you face two CPU-controlled opponents.[CR]3) Survival mode : Insert your coin(s), hold LP+MP+HP and press Start. Keep holding those buttons at Player Select Screen. You'll get to fight all 27 characters in continuous one-round battles.[CR]* Secret Messages (this trick only works on Japanese SFZ3 machines) : After winning a battle, press and hold Start as well as any other button. Between battles, a message will appear on the screen, depending on the button you're holding.[CR]* Sari In Every Stage : In Dhalsim's stage you may have noticed a girl who cheers for him. That is Sari, his wife. When you play as Dhalsim, its possible to make her appear on every fight by holding down LP+HK before the fight starts (you must do this at the beginning of every round).[CR]* Alternate Sodom BGM : When fighting against Sodom (VS or CPU), you'll get to hear a different tune if it is on X-ISM mode. Apparently the tune is inspired on his boss tune in "Final Fight".[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Street Fighter (1987)[CR]2. Street Fighter II - The World Warrior [CP-S No. 14] (1991)[CR]3.

				<plot>Street Fighter Zero 3 (c) 1998 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]25 fighters mix it up to have a shot at Shin Vega in the height of his power! Featuring 3 fighting styles for each character.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Green Board [Japan][CR]Players: Up to 2.[CR]Control: 8-way joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 6 per player.[CR]= &gt; [1] LP, [2] MP, [3] HP[CR]= &gt; [4] LK, [5] MK, [6] HK[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Street Fighter Zero 3 was released in June 1998 in the Japananese arcades. It was known as the 29th video game released on the CPS2 hardware.[CR]Known export releases:[CR]"Street Fighter Alpha 3 [Blue Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Zero 3 [Grey Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Alpha 3 [Orange Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Alpha 3 [Pink Board]"[CR]Guy, Cody, Sodom and Rolento are from Capcom's "Final Fight" - Guy and Cody as selectable characters, Sodom as the second boss and Rolento as the fourth boss in "Final Fight". "Final Fight" boss 'Edi E' makes appearances in some of Cody's finishing poses.[CR]The reason for Mike Haggar's (the third selectable character in "Final Fight") non-appearance in Street Fighter was that he was too similar to Zangief. Furthermore, it could be because during the "Street Fighter Zero" storyline, Mike Haggar was assumed to be the mayor of Metro City (a part of New York) at the time. [CR]In Guy's stage there is a group from "Final Fight" cheering Guy on. They consist of: Mike Haggar, Andorre Jr., Axl and poison. Also in the background against one of the buildings there is a advert for a Rockman Drink just under the Capcom Logo. [CR]Karin Kanzuki is the first Street Fighter to have originated from a comic book (actually, a manga). She first appeared in a girls' manga that had Sakura Kasugano as the main character. [CR]The three ISMs have some symbolic meaning : [CR]* X-ISM represents "Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge". That is, this ISM matches closely to the gameplay style found therein. There are, however, a few differences between X-ISM in Zero 3 and Super Street Fighter II X, mainly because of the Zero 3 game engine. [CR]* Z-ISM represents Zero. That is, it is closest to the style of the previous Zero games. [CR]* V-ISM represents Variable, as in 'Variable Combination', meaning 'Custom Combo'. This merely represents how you can use your super bar. [CR]Even though "Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge" is known as "Super Street Fighter II Turbo" outside Japan, X-ISM is still known as X-ISM in all export releases of Zero 3.[CR]Attack of the Vega Dolls: Each Vega doll is named after a month of the year in the language of their supposed origin. It is said that they wield different tools, but generally share the same style. It is said that they generally worked as a team. [CR]1) Enero (January) from Spain uses a microphone. [CR]2) Fevrier (February) from France uses a gun. [CR]3) Marz (March) from Germany uses a laptop and dyes her hair. Enero and Marz are the information and recon members of the team. [CR]4) Aprile (April) from Italy is the medical member of the team. At the beginning of SFA3, Aprile's brother had asked Rose to find her whereabouts. [CR]5) Satsuki (May) is Japanese and wields a sword. Some say Sakura was supposed to be kidnapped instead of Satsuki, but Sakura evaded capture. This belief is consistent with the fact that all 12 dolls (and Cammy) were 16 at the time of SFA3. [CR]6) Juni (June) is German and fights unarmed. [CR]7) Juli (July) is also German and also fights unarmed. Despite the claims of some sources, Juni and Juli are not related (none of the Bison dolls are). [CR]8) Santamu (August) is Vietnamese, but of African heritage. SANTAMU is the equivalent of Vietnamese's 8th month. However, the Vietnamese's spelling should be 'Thang Tam'. It's a compound word of 'month' &amp; 'eight', obviously. She wields a spear and can also unleash a small monkey to attack for her. [CR]9) Xiayu (September) is Chinese and wields the nunchaku. [CR]10) Jianyu (October) is also Chinese and wields a staff. [CR]11) Noembelu (November) is Mexican and is a member of T. Hawk's tribe (thus T. Hawk was looking for her and not Juli as the story implied). She wields a pair of hatchets on ropes. [CR]12) Decapre (December) is Russian and her appearance is similar to that of Cammy. [CR]Cammy had tried to save the Vega dolls in her SFZ3 ending because, due to the extent of their brainwashing, they would have died with Vega otherwise. It is said that the inspiration of the Vega dolls was Yuka Minakawa's novels named collectively as 'Cammy History'. Before the fight, Cammy throws a red coat, this comes from Street Fighter 2 the Animated Movie. [CR]Various characters of the game make a cameo in a marvel comic-book of Deadpool, the Merc with a mouth, vol.1 number 8. They appear in the shadows like mercenaries of the infernal house, the place where Deadpool obtains his merc jobs. We can recognize Adon, Dhalsim and Akuma as shadows, Sagat appears drawn and coloured. There are two more fighters, one appears to be Cammy. The artist of this Deadpool issue is Ed McGuiness. [CR]In number 27 of Deadpool's comic, the author Joe Kelly, makes a homage to the Street Fighter series. In this comic Deadpool does a "Shoryuken" to Kitty Pride to make Wolverine attack him. [CR]Suleputer released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Street Fighter Zero 3 Original Soundtrack - CPCA-1012, 1013) on September 21, 1998.[CR]An upgraded version of SFZ3 appeared as "Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper" in 2001. Previously hidden characters M. Bison, Juni and Juli are playable from the start. In addition, past Street Fighter legends Guile, Dee Jay, Fei Long and T. Hawk are now playable as well. This brings the total count to 34 playable characters! [CR]An even further upgraded version of SFZ3, called "Street Fighter Zero 3 Double Upper" appeared for the Sony PSP in 2006, and adds Eagle (from the original Street Fighter), Yun (from SFIII), Maki (from the Super Famicom Final Fight 2) and newcomer Ingrid. This now brings the total count of playable characters to 38![CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Green Board revisions : [CR]REVISION 1:[CR]* Build date: 980629[CR]REVISION 2:[CR]* Build date: 980727[CR]REVISION 3:[CR]* Build date: 980904[CR]Revision 1 had two bugs involving Karin : First, she could do her Kanzuki-ryuu Kou'ou Ken super in X-ISM (which she shouldn't be able to do, as it was her second super). Second, Karin's normal throw in Mazi Mode could do 99% damage.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Title Color Chart : The color of the title screen denotes what secrets are currently available. After a few weeks of play, the title screen will change color, so in a few months after your SFZ3 machine has been installed, it should reach the final color (light blue). The explanation of the colors is shown below :[CR]Cream - (default color)[CR]Green - Classical Mode[CR]Red - M. Bison, Juni and Juli become playable[CR]Dark Blue - Mazi Mode[CR]Purple - Saikyou Mode[CR]Light Blue - Can select one of the three Battle Modes[CR]* Random Select : The Random Select squares are normally invisible. But, there are two for the first player and two for the second. The 1P squares are located in the upper-right corner of the diamond and the lower-right. The 2P squares are in the upper-left corner and the lower-left corners.[CR]* Hidden Characters : The three hidden charactes are M. Bison, the boxer and Juni and Juli, two prototype 'dolls' created by Vega's Shadowloo organization. Once the game's title screen has become the proper color (see 'Title Color Chart', above), their score listing will show up in the High Score listing and they become playable...[CR]1) To choose M. Bison, pause on Karin for five seconds, then move to any Random Select square, hold the Start button and press any button.[CR]2) To use Juli, pause on Karin for five seconds, then move to any Random Select square. If the square is on the left side of the screen, choose her by holding Left and pressing any button. If the square is on the right side, then hold Right and press any button instead.[CR]3) To use Juni, pause on Karin for five seconds, then move to any Random Select square. If the square is on the top of the screen, choose her by holding Up and pressing any button. If the square is on the bottom, then hold Down and press any button instead.[CR]* Hidden Modes Of Play : There are three secret modes that affect basic gameplay. Once the game's title screen has become the proper color (see 'Title Color Chart', above), you can select a hidden mode to use...[CR]1) To use Classical Mode, insert your coin, hold down HP+HK and press Start. You can release HP+HK once you're at the Player Select Screen. Then, pick your character. When you start the round your super power bar will be gone and you will have Street Fighter 2 moves.[CR]2) To use Mazi Mode, insert your coin, hold down MP+MK and press Start. You can release HP+HK once you're at the Player Select Screen. Then, pick your character.[CR]3) To use Saikyou Mode, insert your coin, hold down LP+LK and press Start. You can release HP+HK once you're at the Player Select Screen. Then, pick your character.[CR]* Hidden Battle Mode : Once the game's title screen has become the proper color (see 'Title Color Chart', above), you can select a hidden battle mode...[CR]1) Final battle mode : After picking your ISM, hold Start+LP+MK+HP. You'll fight Shin Vega for one battle only. It's just like the last battle; win and you get your ending, lose and you get the bad ending.[CR]2) Dramatic battle mode : Hold LK+MK+HK, then press Start. Keep holding those buttons at Player Select Screen for a moment. You'll fight a 2 on 1 battle for 6 rounds, in which you face two CPU-controlled opponents.[CR]3) Survival mode : Insert your coin(s), hold LP+MP+HP and press Start. Keep holding those buttons at Player Select Screen. You'll get to fight all 27 characters in continuous one-round battles.[CR]* Secret Messages (this trick only works on Japanese SFZ3 machines) : After winning a battle, press and hold Start as well as any other button. Between battles, a message will appear on the screen, depending on the button you're holding.[CR]* Sari In Every Stage : In Dhalsim's stage you may have noticed a girl who cheers for him. That is Sari, his wife. When you play as Dhalsim, its possible to make her appear on every fight by holding down LP+HK before the fight starts (you must do this at the beginning of every round).[CR]* Alternate Sodom BGM : When fighting against Sodom (VS or CPU), you'll get to hear a different tune if it is on X-ISM mode. Apparently the tune is inspired on his boss tune in "Final Fight".[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Street Fighter (1987)[CR]2. Street Fighter II - The World Warrior [CP-S No. 14] (1991)[CR]3.

"Final Fight" boss 'Edi E' makes appearances in some of Cody's finishing poses.[CR]The reason for Mike Haggar's (the third selectable character in "Final Fight") non-appearance in Street Fighter was that he was too similar to Zangief. Furthermore, it could be because during the "Street Fighter Zero" storyline, Mike Haggar was assumed to be the mayor of Metro City (a part of New York) at the time. [CR]In Guy's stage there is a group from "Final Fight" cheering Guy on. They consist of: Mike Haggar, Andorre Jr., Axl and poison. Also in the background against one of the buildings there is a advert for a Rockman Drink just under the Capcom Logo. [CR]Karin Kanzuki is the first Street Fighter to have originated from a comic book (actually, a manga). She first appeared in a girls' manga that had Sakura Kasugano as the main character. [CR]The three ISMs have some symbolic meaning : [CR]* X-ISM represents "Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge". That is, this ISM matches closely to the gameplay style found therein. There are, however, a few differences between X-ISM in Zero 3 and Super Street Fighter II X, mainly because of the Zero 3 game engine. [CR]* Z-ISM represents Zero. That is, it is closest to the style of the previous Zero games. [CR]* V-ISM represents Variable, as in 'Variable Combination', meaning 'Custom Combo'. This merely represents how you can use your super bar. [CR]Even though "Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge" is known as "Super Street Fighter II Turbo" outside Japan, X-ISM is still known as X-ISM in all export releases of Zero 3.[CR]Attack of the Vega Dolls: Each Vega doll is named after a month of the year in the language of their supposed origin. It is said that they wield different tools, but generally share the same style. It is said that they generally worked as a team. [CR]1) Enero (January) from Spain uses a microphone. [CR]2) Fevrier (February) from France uses a gun. [CR]3) Marz (March) from Germany uses a laptop and dyes her hair. Enero and Marz are the information and recon members of the team. [CR]4) Aprile (April) from Italy is the medical member of the team. At the beginning of SFA3, Aprile's brother had asked Rose to find her whereabouts. [CR]5) Satsuki (May) is Japanese and wields a sword. Some say Sakura was supposed to be kidnapped instead of Satsuki, but Sakura evaded capture. This belief is consistent with the fact that all 12 dolls (and Cammy) were 16 at the time of SFA3. [CR]6) Juni (June) is German and fights unarmed. [CR]7) Juli (July) is also German and also fights unarmed. Despite the claims of some sources, Juni and Juli are not related (none of the Bison dolls are). [CR]8) Santamu (August) is Vietnamese, but of African heritage. SANTAMU is the equivalent of Vietnamese's 8th month. However, the Vietnamese's spelling should be 'Thang Tam'. It's a compound word of 'month' &amp; 'eight', obviously. She wields a spear and can also unleash a small monkey to attack for her. [CR]9) Xiayu (September) is Chinese and wields the nunchaku. [CR]10) Jianyu (October) is also Chinese and wields a staff. [CR]11) Noembelu (November) is Mexican and is a member of T. Hawk's tribe (thus T. Hawk was looking for her and not Juli as the story implied). She wields a pair of hatchets on ropes. [CR]12) Decapre (December) is Russian and her appearance is similar to that of Cammy. [CR]Cammy had tried to save the Vega dolls in her SFZ3 ending because, due to the extent of their brainwashing, they would have died with Vega otherwise. It is said that the inspiration of the Vega dolls was Yuka Minakawa's novels named collectively as 'Cammy History'. Before the fight, Cammy throws a red coat, this comes from Street Fighter 2 the Animated Movie. [CR]Various characters of the game make a cameo in a marvel comic-book of Deadpool, the Merc with a mouth, vol.1 number 8. They appear in the shadows like mercenaries of the infernal house, the place where Deadpool obtains his merc jobs. We can recognize Adon, Dhalsim and Akuma as shadows, Sagat appears drawn and coloured. There are two more fighters, one appears to be Cammy. The artist of this Deadpool issue is Ed McGuiness. [CR]In number 27 of Deadpool's comic, the author Joe Kelly, makes a homage to the Street Fighter series. In this comic Deadpool does a "Shoryuken" to Kitty Pride to make Wolverine attack him. [CR]Suleputer released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Street Fighter Zero 3 Original Soundtrack - CPCA-1012, 1013) on September 21, 1998.[CR]An upgraded version of SFZ3 appeared as "Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper" in 2001. Previously hidden characters M. Bison, Juni and Juli are playable from the start. In addition, past Street Fighter legends Guile, Dee Jay, Fei Long and T. Hawk are now playable as well. This brings the total count to 34 playable characters! [CR]An even further upgraded version of SFZ3, called "Street Fighter Zero 3 Double Upper" appeared for the Sony PSP in 2006, and adds Eagle (from the original Street Fighter), Yun (from SFIII), Maki (from the Super Famicom Final Fight 2) and newcomer Ingrid. This now brings the total count of playable characters to 38![CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Green Board revisions : [CR]REVISION 1:[CR]* Build date: 980629[CR]REVISION 2:[CR]* Build date: 980727[CR]REVISION 3:[CR]* Build date: 980904[CR]Revision 1 had two bugs involving Karin : First, she could do her Kanzuki-ryuu Kou'ou Ken super in X-ISM (which she shouldn't be able to do, as it was her second super). Second, Karin's normal throw in Mazi Mode could do 99% damage.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Title Color Chart : The color of the title screen denotes what secrets are currently available. After a few weeks of play, the title screen will change color, so in a few months after your SFZ3 machine has been installed, it should reach the final color (light blue). The explanation of the colors is shown below :[CR]Cream - (default color)[CR]Green - Classical Mode[CR]Red - M. Bison, Juni and Juli become playable[CR]Dark Blue - Mazi Mode[CR]Purple - Saikyou Mode[CR]Light Blue - Can select one of the three Battle Modes[CR]* Random Select : The Random Select squares are normally invisible. But, there are two for the first player and two for the second. The 1P squares are located in the upper-right corner of the diamond and the lower-right. The 2P squares are in the upper-left corner and the lower-left corners.[CR]* Hidden Characters : The three hidden charactes are M. Bison, the boxer and Juni and Juli, two prototype 'dolls' created by Vega's Shadowloo organization. Once the game's title screen has become the proper color (see 'Title Color Chart', above), their score listing will show up in the High Score listing and they become playable...[CR]1) To choose M. Bison, pause on Karin for five seconds, then move to any Random Select square, hold the Start button and press any button.[CR]2) To use Juli, pause on Karin for five seconds, then move to any Random Select square. If the square is on the left side of the screen, choose her by holding Left and pressing any button. If the square is on the right side, then hold Right and press any button instead.[CR]3) To use Juni, pause on Karin for five seconds, then move to any Random Select square. If the square is on the top of the screen, choose her by holding Up and pressing any button. If the square is on the bottom, then hold Down and press any button instead.[CR]* Hidden Modes Of Play : There are three secret modes that affect basic gameplay. Once the game's title screen has become the proper color (see 'Title Color Chart', above), you can select a hidden mode to use...[CR]1) To use Classical Mode, insert your coin, hold down HP+HK and press Start. You can release HP+HK once you're at the Player Select Screen. Then, pick your character. When you start the round your super power bar will be gone and you will have Street Fighter 2 moves.[CR]2) To use Mazi Mode, insert your coin, hold down MP+MK and press Start. You can release HP+HK once you're at the Player Select Screen. Then, pick your character.[CR]3) To use Saikyou Mode, insert your coin, hold down LP+LK and press Start. You can release HP+HK once you're at the Player Select Screen. Then, pick your character.[CR]* Hidden Battle Mode : Once the game's title screen has become the proper color (see 'Title Color Chart', above), you can select a hidden battle mode...[CR]1) Final battle mode : After picking your ISM, hold Start+LP+MK+HP. You'll fight Shin Vega for one battle only. It's just like the last battle; win and you get your ending, lose and you get the bad ending.[CR]2) Dramatic battle mode : Hold LK+MK+HK, then press Start. Keep holding those buttons at Player Select Screen for a moment. You'll fight a 2 on 1 battle for 6 rounds, in which you face two CPU-controlled opponents.[CR]3) Survival mode : Insert your coin(s), hold LP+MP+HP and press Start. Keep holding those buttons at Player Select Screen. You'll get to fight all 27 characters in continuous one-round battles.[CR]* Secret Messages (this trick only works on Japanese SFZ3 machines) : After winning a battle, press and hold Start as well as any other button. Between battles, a message will appear on the screen, depending on the button you're holding.[CR]* Sari In Every Stage : In Dhalsim's stage you may have noticed a girl who cheers for him. That is Sari, his wife. When you play as Dhalsim, its possible to make her appear on every fight by holding down LP+HK before the fight starts (you must do this at the beginning of every round).[CR]* Alternate Sodom BGM : When fighting against Sodom (VS or CPU), you'll get to hear a different tune if it is on X-ISM mode. Apparently the tune is inspired on his boss tune in "Final Fight".[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Street Fighter (1987)[CR]2. Street Fighter II - The World Warrior [CP-S No. 14] (1991)[CR]3.

Second, Karin's normal throw in Mazi Mode could do 99% damage.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Title Color Chart : The color of the title screen denotes what secrets are currently available. After a few weeks of play, the title screen will change color, so in a few months after your SFZ3 machine has been installed, it should reach the final color (light blue). The explanation of the colors is shown below :[CR]Cream - (default color)[CR]Green - Classical Mode[CR]Red - M. Bison, Juni and Juli become playable[CR]Dark Blue - Mazi Mode[CR]Purple - Saikyou Mode[CR]Light Blue - Can select one of the three Battle Modes[CR]* Random Select : The Random Select squares are normally invisible. But, there are two for the first player and two for the second. The 1P squares are located in the upper-right corner of the diamond and the lower-right. The 2P squares are in the upper-left corner and the lower-left corners.[CR]* Hidden Characters : The three hidden charactes are M. Bison, the boxer and Juni and Juli, two prototype 'dolls' created by Vega's Shadowloo organization. Once the game's title screen has become the proper color (see 'Title Color Chart', above), their score listing will show up in the High Score listing and they become playable...[CR]1) To choose M. Bison, pause on Karin for five seconds, then move to any Random Select square, hold the Start button and press any button.[CR]2) To use Juli, pause on Karin for five seconds, then move to any Random Select square. If the square is on the left side of the screen, choose her by holding Left and pressing any button. If the square is on the right side, then hold Right and press any button instead.[CR]3) To use Juni, pause on Karin for five seconds, then move to any Random Select square. If the square is on the top of the screen, choose her by holding Up and pressing any button. If the square is on the bottom, then hold Down and press any button instead.[CR]* Hidden Modes Of Play : There are three secret modes that affect basic gameplay. Once the game's title screen has become the proper color (see 'Title Color Chart', above), you can select a hidden mode to use...[CR]1) To use Classical Mode, insert your coin, hold down HP+HK and press Start. You can release HP+HK once you're at the Player Select Screen. Then, pick your character. When you start the round your super power bar will be gone and you will have Street Fighter 2 moves.[CR]2) To use Mazi Mode, insert your coin, hold down MP+MK and press Start. You can release HP+HK once you're at the Player Select Screen. Then, pick your character.[CR]3) To use Saikyou Mode, insert your coin, hold down LP+LK and press Start. You can release HP+HK once you're at the Player Select Screen. Then, pick your character.[CR]* Hidden Battle Mode : Once the game's title screen has become the proper color (see 'Title Color Chart', above), you can select a hidden battle mode...[CR]1) Final battle mode : After picking your ISM, hold Start+LP+MK+HP. You'll fight Shin Vega for one battle only. It's just like the last battle; win and you get your ending, lose and you get the bad ending.[CR]2) Dramatic battle mode : Hold LK+MK+HK, then press Start. Keep holding those buttons at Player Select Screen for a moment. You'll fight a 2 on 1 battle for 6 rounds, in which you face two CPU-controlled opponents.[CR]3) Survival mode : Insert your coin(s), hold LP+MP+HP and press Start. Keep holding those buttons at Player Select Screen. You'll get to fight all 27 characters in continuous one-round battles.[CR]* Secret Messages (this trick only works on Japanese SFZ3 machines) : After winning a battle, press and hold Start as well as any other button. Between battles, a message will appear on the screen, depending on the button you're holding.[CR]* Sari In Every Stage : In Dhalsim's stage you may have noticed a girl who cheers for him. That is Sari, his wife. When you play as Dhalsim, its possible to make her appear on every fight by holding down LP+HK before the fight starts (you must do this at the beginning of every round).[CR]* Alternate Sodom BGM : When fighting against Sodom (VS or CPU), you'll get to hear a different tune if it is on X-ISM mode. Apparently the tune is inspired on his boss tune in "Final Fight".[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Street Fighter (1987)[CR]2. Street Fighter II - The World Warrior [CP-S No. 14] (1991)[CR]3.

				<plot>Street Fighter Zero (c) 1995 Capcom Co, Limited.[CR]The new look of the Street Fighter series, with ten characters including old favorites and new surprises.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Green Board [Japan][CR]Players: Up to 2.[CR]Control: 8-way joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 6 per player.[CR]= &gt; [1] LP, [2] MP, [3] HP [CR]= &gt; [4] LK, [5] MK, [6] HK[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Street Fighter Zero was released in June 1995 in the Japanese arcades. It was known there as the 11th video game released for the CPS2 hardware.[CR]Known Export releases:[CR]"Street Fighter Alpha - Warriors' Dreams [Blue Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Zero [Grey Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Zero [Orange Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Zero [Pink Board]"[CR]The Zero series of games take place between the original Street Fighter and Street Fighter II. The scar on Sagat's chest in SFII is said to be from Ryu's Shouryuuken during the final battle in the original Street Fighter. In SF Zero, Sagat has the scar on his chest, so it must take place after the first Street Fighter. The character Nash was mentioned in Guile's ending in SFII. He is a friend of Guile who was killed by Vega. Since Nash is still alive in the Zero series, it must take place before SFII.[CR]This is the first Street Fighter game to have the Dramatic Battle Mode, a feature no doubt inspired by the Japanese animated movie, 'Street Fighter II', where Ken and Ryu team up to fight M. Bison in the final battle.[CR]This game marks the first time Gouki's name is displayed on-screen in the game.[CR]Ryu / Guy stages : [CR]The "Son Son" convenience store in Ryu and Guy's stages is named after an earlier Capcom game of the same name. [CR]A poster for the animated feature film version of Street Fighter II can be seen on display.[CR]The kanji on the small sign on the bath-house means 'Honda Bath'. [CR]The curtain on the bath-house (in Guy's version of the stage) says 'yu' in hiragana, which is the reading for the 'bath' kanji on the 'Honda Bath' sign. [CR]In "Street Fighter Zero 3", Edmond Honda's stage is in front of this (or a similar-looking) bath-house with slightly different signs on it. [CR]In "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" (and all its follow-ups), Honda's stage is inside of a bath house.[CR]Guy and Sodom are from Capcom's "Final Fight" - Guy as selectable character and Sodom as the second boss in Final Fight. Guy's music is taken from "Final Fight".[CR]Sodom is a westerner who is obsessed with Japanese culture and apparently doesn't speak Japanese very well. In the Japanese versions of these games, Sodom's victory quotes are meaningless sentences composed of English words (e.g., 'SHOW BY HUNG JAW') followed by a Japanese translation of what he actually meant to say. In Sodom's ending, he claims about reforming and renaming the Mad Gear gang into something with four kanji. Those kanji read 'Ma-do-gi-a'. Now this could just be random kanji that, when strung together, sound like 'Mad Gear', but by the same token, it can sound like 'Mad Doggie'. The jitte weapons Sodom uses were used by policemen in feudal Japan.[CR]Change of Race: In the original "Street Fighter", Birdie looked Caucasian. In SF Alpha, Birdie is black. The reason for this change is explained in one of Birdie's "Street Fighter Zero 3" win quotes (he was sick at the time of the first Street Fighter).[CR]Sony Music Entertainment released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Street Fighter Zero Arcade Game Track - SRCL-3297) on August 21, 1995.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Green Board releases:[CR]REVISION 1:[CR]* Build date: 950605[CR]REVISION 2:[CR]* Build date: 950627[CR]REVISION 3:[CR]* Build date: 950727[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Gouki: Put the cursor on the [?] on your side and hold Start, then press...

				<plot>Street Fighter Zero (c) 1995 Capcom Co, Limited.[CR]The new look of the Street Fighter series, with ten characters including old favorites and new surprises.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Green Board [Japan][CR]Players: Up to 2.[CR]Control: 8-way joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 6 per player.[CR]= &gt; [1] LP, [2] MP, [3] HP [CR]= &gt; [4] LK, [5] MK, [6] HK[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Street Fighter Zero was released in June 1995 in the Japanese arcades. It was known there as the 11th video game released for the CPS2 hardware.[CR]Known Export releases:[CR]"Street Fighter Alpha - Warriors' Dreams [Blue Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Zero [Grey Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Zero [Orange Board]"[CR]"Street Fighter Zero [Pink Board]"[CR]The Zero series of games take place between the original Street Fighter and Street Fighter II. The scar on Sagat's chest in SFII is said to be from Ryu's Shouryuuken during the final battle in the original Street Fighter. In SF Zero, Sagat has the scar on his chest, so it must take place after the first Street Fighter. The character Nash was mentioned in Guile's ending in SFII. He is a friend of Guile who was killed by Vega. Since Nash is still alive in the Zero series, it must take place before SFII.[CR]This is the first Street Fighter game to have the Dramatic Battle Mode, a feature no doubt inspired by the Japanese animated movie, 'Street Fighter II', where Ken and Ryu team up to fight M. Bison in the final battle.[CR]This game marks the first time Gouki's name is displayed on-screen in the game.[CR]Ryu / Guy stages : [CR]The "Son Son" convenience store in Ryu and Guy's stages is named after an earlier Capcom game of the same name. [CR]A poster for the animated feature film version of Street Fighter II can be seen on display.[CR]The kanji on the small sign on the bath-house means 'Honda Bath'. [CR]The curtain on the bath-house (in Guy's version of the stage) says 'yu' in hiragana, which is the reading for the 'bath' kanji on the 'Honda Bath' sign. [CR]In "Street Fighter Zero 3", Edmond Honda's stage is in front of this (or a similar-looking) bath-house with slightly different signs on it. [CR]In "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" (and all its follow-ups), Honda's stage is inside of a bath house.[CR]Guy and Sodom are from Capcom's "Final Fight" - Guy as selectable character and Sodom as the second boss in Final Fight. Guy's music is taken from "Final Fight".[CR]Sodom is a westerner who is obsessed with Japanese culture and apparently doesn't speak Japanese very well. In the Japanese versions of these games, Sodom's victory quotes are meaningless sentences composed of English words (e.g., 'SHOW BY HUNG JAW') followed by a Japanese translation of what he actually meant to say. In Sodom's ending, he claims about reforming and renaming the Mad Gear gang into something with four kanji. Those kanji read 'Ma-do-gi-a'. Now this could just be random kanji that, when strung together, sound like 'Mad Gear', but by the same token, it can sound like 'Mad Doggie'. The jitte weapons Sodom uses were used by policemen in feudal Japan.[CR]Change of Race: In the original "Street Fighter", Birdie looked Caucasian. In SF Alpha, Birdie is black. The reason for this change is explained in one of Birdie's "Street Fighter Zero 3" win quotes (he was sick at the time of the first Street Fighter).[CR]Sony Music Entertainment released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Street Fighter Zero Arcade Game Track - SRCL-3297) on August 21, 1995.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Green Board releases:[CR]REVISION 1:[CR]* Build date: 950605[CR]REVISION 2:[CR]* Build date: 950627[CR]REVISION 3:[CR]* Build date: 950727[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Gouki: Put the cursor on the [?] on your side and hold Start, then press...

				<title_clean>Super Puzzle Fighter II X</title_clean>
				<plot>Super Puzzle Fighter II X (c) 1996 Capcom Co, Limited.[CR]Super Puzzle Fighter II X is a puzzle game for one or two players based upon Capcom's legendary "Street Fighter" and "Vampire" series of fighting games. [CR]Super Puzzle Fighter II X's gameplay is reminiscent of Sega's superb 1992 puzzle game, "Puyo Puyo" with players taking on the role of one of the famous Street Fighter characters, represented visually between the two play areas in the middle of the screen. The aim is to manipulate falling coloured gem blocks, matching the colours to gems already in the play area; before finally destroying them with orbs of a like colour. [CR]Gems can only be eliminated by coming into contact with a 'Crash Gem' of the same colour. This eliminates all adjacent gems of that colour, setting up the potential for huge chain reactions. [CR]As gems are eliminated, garbage blocks called 'Counter Gems' will drop into the opponent's playfield; these will eventually become normal gems, but only after they count down to zero (most Counter Gem countdowns start at '5' and are reduced by one each time a new pair of gems is dropped on that board), until that time they cannot be eliminated by normal means. The only way to eliminate Counter Gems before they become normal gems is to place a Crash Gem of that colour nearby so it eliminates at least one normal gem. If this is done, all Counter Gems immediately adjacent to the Crash Gem will be taken out as well. [CR]Additionally, gems of the same colour that form squares or rectangles (of at least two blocks tall and wide) in the pit become a giant Power Gem of that size and color; eliminating these as part of a combo increases the number of Counter Gems that would otherwise normally appear on the opponent's board. [CR]The only other type of piece to appear is a diamond, which eliminates all the normal, Power, Counter and Crash gems of whichever colour gem it lands on. This, too, will cause Counter Gems to appear on the opponent's board. [CR]Whenever a player destroys a number of blocks, their on-screen Street Fighter counter-part will be shown attacking the opponent character. The fighting move used is dependent on both the colour and number of blocks the player has destroyed. [CR]The available in-game characters, and games from which they are taken (based on first appearance) are : [CR]* Ryu ("Street Fighter") [CR]* Ken ("Street Fighter") [CR]* Chun-Li ("Street Fighter II - The World Warrior") [CR]* Sakura ("Street Fighter Zero 2 [CP-S II No. 15]") [CR]* Morrigan ("Vampire - The Night Warriors [CP-S II No. 05]") [CR]* Donovan ("Vampire Hunter - Darkstalkers' Revenge [CP-S II No. 09]") [CR]* Lei Lei ("Vampire Hunter - Darkstalkers' Revenge [CP-S II No. 09]") [CR]* Felicia ("Vampire - The Night Warriors [CP-S II No. 05]") [CR]Hidden characters:[CR]* Gouki ("Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge [CP-S II No. 03 Bis]") [CR]* Dan ("Street Fighter Zero [CP-S II No. 11]") [CR]* Devilotte ("Cyberbots - Fullmetal Madness [CP-S II No. 10]")[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Green Board [Japan][CR]Players: Up to 2.[CR]Control: 8-way joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 2 per player.[CR]=&gt; ROTATE LEFT, ROTATE RIGHT[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Super Puzzle Fighter II X was released in May 1996 in the Japanese Arcades.

				<plot>Super Puzzle Fighter II X (c) 1996 Capcom Co, Limited.[CR]Super Puzzle Fighter II X is a puzzle game for one or two players based upon Capcom's legendary "Street Fighter" and "Vampire" series of fighting games. [CR]Super Puzzle Fighter II X's gameplay is reminiscent of Sega's superb 1992 puzzle game, "Puyo Puyo" with players taking on the role of one of the famous Street Fighter characters, represented visually between the two play areas in the middle of the screen. The aim is to manipulate falling coloured gem blocks, matching the colours to gems already in the play area; before finally destroying them with orbs of a like colour. [CR]Gems can only be eliminated by coming into contact with a 'Crash Gem' of the same colour. This eliminates all adjacent gems of that colour, setting up the potential for huge chain reactions. [CR]As gems are eliminated, garbage blocks called 'Counter Gems' will drop into the opponent's playfield; these will eventually become normal gems, but only after they count down to zero (most Counter Gem countdowns start at '5' and are reduced by one each time a new pair of gems is dropped on that board), until that time they cannot be eliminated by normal means. The only way to eliminate Counter Gems before they become normal gems is to place a Crash Gem of that colour nearby so it eliminates at least one normal gem. If this is done, all Counter Gems immediately adjacent to the Crash Gem will be taken out as well. [CR]Additionally, gems of the same colour that form squares or rectangles (of at least two blocks tall and wide) in the pit become a giant Power Gem of that size and color; eliminating these as part of a combo increases the number of Counter Gems that would otherwise normally appear on the opponent's board. [CR]The only other type of piece to appear is a diamond, which eliminates all the normal, Power, Counter and Crash gems of whichever colour gem it lands on. This, too, will cause Counter Gems to appear on the opponent's board. [CR]Whenever a player destroys a number of blocks, their on-screen Street Fighter counter-part will be shown attacking the opponent character. The fighting move used is dependent on both the colour and number of blocks the player has destroyed. [CR]The available in-game characters, and games from which they are taken (based on first appearance) are : [CR]* Ryu ("Street Fighter") [CR]* Ken ("Street Fighter") [CR]* Chun-Li ("Street Fighter II - The World Warrior") [CR]* Sakura ("Street Fighter Zero 2 [CP-S II No. 15]") [CR]* Morrigan ("Vampire - The Night Warriors [CP-S II No. 05]") [CR]* Donovan ("Vampire Hunter - Darkstalkers' Revenge [CP-S II No. 09]") [CR]* Lei Lei ("Vampire Hunter - Darkstalkers' Revenge [CP-S II No. 09]") [CR]* Felicia ("Vampire - The Night Warriors [CP-S II No. 05]") [CR]Hidden characters:[CR]* Gouki ("Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge [CP-S II No. 03 Bis]") [CR]* Dan ("Street Fighter Zero [CP-S II No. 11]") [CR]* Devilotte ("Cyberbots - Fullmetal Madness [CP-S II No. 10]")[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Green Board [Japan][CR]Players: Up to 2.[CR]Control: 8-way joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 2 per player.[CR]=&gt; ROTATE LEFT, ROTATE RIGHT[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Super Puzzle Fighter II X was released in May 1996 in the Japanese Arcades. It was known there as the 16th video game released for the CPS2 hardware.[CR]The title is derived from "Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge", but most of the graphics, sounds, and presentation is inspired by "Street Fighter Zero".[CR]The game is known outside Japan as "Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo". Here are some known Export releases : [CR]"Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo [Blue Board]"[CR]"Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo [Orange Board]"[CR]"Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo [Grey Board]"[CR]Devilot (secret character) is from "Cyberbots - Fullmetal Madness" (on the S-008 Super-8).[CR]In the background of Chun-Li's stage, there is "Son Son" flying around on a cloud.[CR]Sakura's stage is based on Ryu and Guy's stages from "Street Fighter Zero".[CR]Ryu's stage is a variation of this, with a bunch of strange stuff in the background.[CR]Ken's stage is based on Ken and Nash's stages from "Street Fighter Zero".[CR]Dan's stage is a variation of this stage, set at a different time of day.[CR]Gouki's stage is based on his "Street Fighter Zero 2" stage.[CR]Victor Entertainment released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Quiz Nanairo Dreams Nijiirochou no Kiseki, Super Puzzle Fighter II X - VICL-40210) on January 22, 1997.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Gouki : Move to Morrigan if you're player one or to Felicia if you're player two.

				<plot>Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers (c) 1993 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]The fourth game in the SFII series featured all new graphics, redone sounds, and above all, four characters new to the series. Here is a full list of changes from previous SFII games:[CR]* New title screen with new music. [CR]* Completely new portraits for all characters. M. Bison ('Vega' in Japan) now has a winged-skull on his hat instead of a star. [CR]* New endings for the bosses. The last part of Chun Li's ending is also modified, letting the player choose whether she should now live a normal girl's life or continue being a detective. [CR]* Vega ('Balrog' in Japan) no longer climbs the fence on his stage prior to doing his 'Flying Barcelona Attack' or 'Izuna Drop' moves. He now just jumps to the edge of the screen and jumps off, as he does in the other stages. [CR]* Voice samples for all characters and announcer re-recorded with different actors. Each character now have their own unique voice so there is no more shared voice samples (e.g. the male 'KO' scream). [CR]* Background music playback is handled differently. The background music will play continuously from Round 1 to Round 2 until a character causes the KO sign to flash on Round 2, which will trigger the 'Heavy Damage' version of the music. From Round 3 onward, the music is played in the same format as in previous SFII games. [CR]* Four completely new stage backgrounds with new background music to accompany the New Challengers. [CR]* Color schemes for the twelve original stage backgrounds have changed once again : [CR]1) Ryu stage: The sky is now near evening, and the moon is now white with a touch of light blue. [CR]2) E. Honda stage: The walls are now light blue, and the big picture (excluding the sun) is now red-orange. [CR]3) Blanka stage: The vine where the snake is coiled is now light green, and people to the right have changed a bit. The river behind the village is now a clear blue. [CR]4) Guile stage: The sky is back to daytime, the canopy on the jet is now clear, and the people in the background are now dressed in blue. The symbol on the ground is back to blue, but the missile linings are still red. [CR]5) Ken stage: The tugboat has been replaced with a yacht, the two guys on the top now wear orange clothes and white clothes. On the bottom, the first person now wears a green shirt and has gray hair, the second person now wears white t-shirt and yellow pants, the third person now has long hair and wears white top and pink skirt, the fourth person now wears light blue shirt and orange pants, and the guy in the trenchcoat and hat is now replaced by a new person in blue shirt and navy blue pants.[CR]6) Chun Li stage: The sky is now sunset, the two customers now wear orange, the meat store's roof is now green with its sign back to red, the guy holding the chicken now wears blue, the "Shanghai Friend Corridor" sign is now red-orange with yellow letters, the guy to the right now wears green pants, and the water sign is now blue.[CR]7) Zangief stage: The stage floor is now green, and the area to the left is back to red. In addition, the fence on the left foreground is now lowered a bit. [CR]8) Dhalsim stage: The curtains and stone floor are now green, and the carpet is back to red. [CR]9) Balrog ([JP] M. Bison) stage: While the stage floor is still purple, the 'Las Vegas' on the floor is now yellow. The car to the left is now blue, and the car to the right is now green. The guy throwing the confetti at win/lose now wears yellow, the guy next to the car to the left now wears purple and the guy next to the guy throwing the confetti has been redesigned.[CR]10) Vega ([JP] Balrog) stage: The stage floor now shows off a green hue, and the fence now comes crashing down at the start of the fight. [CR]11) Sagat stage: Buddhist statue is still gold, and now it's sunset. In addition, a big city is now visible in the distance. [CR]12) M. Bison ([JP] Vega) stage: The sky is now back to daytime, and the guys sitting Indian style praying (and stands up angrily after breaking a big statue) are now dark-skinned. The roof of the palace is now red with green trim, and the linings on the giant bell that were previously red are now black.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Green Board [Japan][CR]Players: Up to 2. [CR]Control: 8-way joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 6 per player.[CR]= &gt; [1] LP (Jab), [2] MP (Strong), [3] HP (Fierce) [CR]= &gt; [4] LK (Short), [5] MK (Forward), [6] HK (Roundhouse)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]September 1993 was the first revision of the game, but most arcades didn't get the game until October 1993. It was known as the first CPS2 video game released.[CR]Known Export releases:[CR]"Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers [Blue Board]"[CR]"Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers [Grey Board]"[CR]"Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers [Orange Board]"[CR]While New Challengers Cammy, Fei Long and T. Hawk were created by Japanese employees at Capcom, the Jamaican kickboxer Dee Jay is the first and only Street Fighter to have been created by an American Capcom employee (James Goddard).

				<plot>Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers (c) 1993 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]The fourth game in the SFII series featured all new graphics, redone sounds, and above all, four characters new to the series. Here is a full list of changes from previous SFII games:[CR]* New title screen with new music. [CR]* Completely new portraits for all characters. M. Bison ('Vega' in Japan) now has a winged-skull on his hat instead of a star. [CR]* New endings for the bosses. The last part of Chun Li's ending is also modified, letting the player choose whether she should now live a normal girl's life or continue being a detective. [CR]* Vega ('Balrog' in Japan) no longer climbs the fence on his stage prior to doing his 'Flying Barcelona Attack' or 'Izuna Drop' moves. He now just jumps to the edge of the screen and jumps off, as he does in the other stages. [CR]* Voice samples for all characters and announcer re-recorded with different actors. Each character now have their own unique voice so there is no more shared voice samples (e.g. the male 'KO' scream). [CR]* Background music playback is handled differently. The background music will play continuously from Round 1 to Round 2 until a character causes the KO sign to flash on Round 2, which will trigger the 'Heavy Damage' version of the music. From Round 3 onward, the music is played in the same format as in previous SFII games. [CR]* Four completely new stage backgrounds with new background music to accompany the New Challengers. [CR]* Color schemes for the twelve original stage backgrounds have changed once again : [CR]1) Ryu stage: The sky is now near evening, and the moon is now white with a touch of light blue. [CR]2) E.

[CR]4) Guile stage: The sky is back to daytime, the canopy on the jet is now clear, and the people in the background are now dressed in blue. The symbol on the ground is back to blue, but the missile linings are still red. [CR]5) Ken stage: The tugboat has been replaced with a yacht, the two guys on the top now wear orange clothes and white clothes. On the bottom, the first person now wears a green shirt and has gray hair, the second person now wears white t-shirt and yellow pants, the third person now has long hair and wears white top and pink skirt, the fourth person now wears light blue shirt and orange pants, and the guy in the trenchcoat and hat is now replaced by a new person in blue shirt and navy blue pants.[CR]6) Chun Li stage: The sky is now sunset, the two customers now wear orange, the meat store's roof is now green with its sign back to red, the guy holding the chicken now wears blue, the "Shanghai Friend Corridor" sign is now red-orange with yellow letters, the guy to the right now wears green pants, and the water sign is now blue.[CR]7) Zangief stage: The stage floor is now green, and the area to the left is back to red. In addition, the fence on the left foreground is now lowered a bit. [CR]8) Dhalsim stage: The curtains and stone floor are now green, and the carpet is back to red. [CR]9) Balrog ([JP] M. Bison) stage: While the stage floor is still purple, the 'Las Vegas' on the floor is now yellow. The car to the left is now blue, and the car to the right is now green. The guy throwing the confetti at win/lose now wears yellow, the guy next to the car to the left now wears purple and the guy next to the guy throwing the confetti has been redesigned.[CR]10) Vega ([JP] Balrog) stage: The stage floor now shows off a green hue, and the fence now comes crashing down at the start of the fight. [CR]11) Sagat stage: Buddhist statue is still gold, and now it's sunset. In addition, a big city is now visible in the distance. [CR]12) M. Bison ([JP] Vega) stage: The sky is now back to daytime, and the guys sitting Indian style praying (and stands up angrily after breaking a big statue) are now dark-skinned. The roof of the palace is now red with green trim, and the linings on the giant bell that were previously red are now black.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Green Board [Japan][CR]Players: Up to 2.

				<plot>Super Street Fighter II - The Tournament Battle (c) 1993 Capcom.[CR]An exclusive 8-player single-elimination tournament mode of "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers", only available when four SSFII cabinets are connected together and all of them configured to "Tournament" mode. This special mode consists of four simultaneous matches: the initial eliminations, the simifinals, and the finals.[CR]After the first set of matches is over, players are re-arranged accordingly based on their position: winners are sent to either of the two cabinets on the left and losers are sent to either of the two cabinets on the right. In the finals, the players competing for first place are sent to the first (leftmost) cabinet, the third-place players to the second cabinet, etc.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Capcom Play System II hardware (CPS II) [CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 11.8 Mhz), Zilog Z80 (@ 8 Mhz) [CR]Sound Chips : Q-Sound (@ 4 Mhz) [CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 8-way joystick [CR]Buttons : 6 [CR]= &gt; [1] LP (Jab), [2] MP (Strong), [3] HP (Fierce) [CR]= &gt; [4] LK (Short), [5] MK (Forward), [6] HK (Roundhouse)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]SSFII The Tournament Battle was released in September 1993.[CR]If you have ever wondered why the characters in "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers" have a ridiculous eight costume colors, then now you will know. This special version is quite rare but allows eight players to fight in a tournament. The reason for the eight costume colors is so all eight players can choose the same character and not get confused about which one they are.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Here is the list of all revisions : [CR]930911 [CR]* Blue board (World)[CR]* Green board (Japan) [CR]911005[CR]* Orange board (South America)[CR]931119 [CR]* Blue board (World)[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Super Secret Colors : Hold down the button you use to select your character for three seconds or so and you can get what is called the 'super' secret color (Note: You can't use the 1P or 2P start buttons to get the secret color).[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]This special "Tournament Battle" is available as the 'Tournament' game mode (selectable item on the Main Menu screen) only on the Nintendo Super NES/Super Famicom and Sega Genesis/Mega Drive ports of "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers".

				<title_clean>Super Street Fighter II X: Grand Master Challenge</title_clean>
				<plot>Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge (c) 1994 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]Here is a list of changes from "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers" : [CR]* Modified title screen with new music. [CR]* The 'Character Select' screen's background music is changed. The new song is based on the title screen theme of the CPS1 SFII games. [CR]* After each character's ending, a new piece of artwork is displayed for that character. In Ryu's new art, the kanji 'Fuurinkazan' are written on his belt. These are the same kanji that are displayed on the breakable signs in Ryu's stage in "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" and "Hyper Street Fighter II - The Anniversary Edition". [CR]* New artwork in Dhalsim's ending. The picture of Dhalsim and his son is replaced with a new picture of Dhalsim with his wife and son. The photograph on the wall now shows Dhalsim with Sagat and Vega (It used to show two generic guys). [CR]* All bonus games have been removed.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Green Board [Japan][CR]Players: Up to 2. [CR]Control: 8-way joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 6 per player.[CR]= &gt; [1] LP (Jab), [2] MP (Strong), [3] HP (Fierce) [CR]= &gt; [4] LK (Short), [5] MK (Forward), [6] HK (Roundhouse)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge was released in February 1994 in the Japanese arcade. It was known as the 'third bis' video game released for the CPS2 hardware.[CR]The game is known outside Japan as "Super Street Fighter II Turbo". Here are some known Export releases:[CR]"Super Street Fighter II Turbo [Blue Board]"[CR]"Super Street Fighter II Turbo [Grey Board]"[CR]"Super Street Fighter II Turbo [Orange Board]"[CR]Also a special 'Rent' version known as "Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challenge [Yellow Board]" has been found.[CR]Originally all of the additional features that were added in this game (Gouki, Supers, etc.) were planned for the original SSFII, but were left out due to time restraints. [CR]Origins of Gouki ('Akuma' outside Japan) : The name 'Sheng Long' comes from the Japanese 'shouryuu', meaning 'rising dragon'. The kanji used in 'shouryuu' was pronounced as if it was Cantonese. One of Ryu's win quotes in the English version of "Street Fighter II" said, 'You must defeat Sheng Long to stand a chance'. At the time, fans of Street Fighter II thought that Sheng Long had referred to a person - the supposed master of Ryu and Ken, and not one of Ryu's moves (the Shouryuu Ken). [CR]The creation of Gouki comes from an April Fool's joke in Electronic Gaming Monthly magazine where the editors claimed that you could fight Sheng Long in the game by not touching Vega ('M. Bison' outside Japan), the final boss of "Street Fighter II". Sheng Long would then come out of nowhere and kill Vega, and you would fight him. Sheng Long was supposed to have the moves of Ryu and Ken, but did much more damage and was also faster. To make this joke more believable, fake screenshots were made. Soon after, many fans, believing that the joke was true, flocked to "Street Fighter II" machines, hoping that they could fight a non-existent character. When asked about whether the joke was true, Capcom did not confirm nor deny it as the sudden infusion of money into their machines was driving up business; Capcom USA was taken in by the gag, and actually contact Capcom Japan and asked if the Sheng Long thing was legit. Only much later was this joke was revealed as such, by Electronic Gaming Monthly themselves. Ironically, in "Super Street Fighter II Turbo", parts of this story became true. Like the joke, Akuma would appear from out of nowhere and kill Bison, and you would fight him, and similarly, Akuma had the moves of Ryu and Ken, and was much faster and dealt much more damage. As many people were accustomed to Sheng Long, many people called Akuma erroneously by the name Akuma Long. The move that was used to kill Bison (the Shun Goku Satsu) was also erroneously called the Bison Killer. [CR]Shin-Gouki, Shin-Gouki and Shin-Gouki : Depending on the kanji that's used for 'Shin', Gouki is of one of several personalities. As regular Gouki (considered to be an evil character by Capcom of America, but just an antihero by Capcom of Japan), he does not condone unnecessary roughness (he helps out those in need and only fights when either under self-defense or when challenged to a match - and any match is a deathmatch in his book). Shin-Gouki found in "Street Fighter Zero 2" is just regular Gouki not pulling his punches (it's the unnecessary roughness thing). Another note: Gouki lives and trains on the island of Gokuentou, reported to have been destroyed in "Street Fighter Zero 2" (but Ryu was the only witness). Or, if you believe the non-canonical Pocket Fighter, turned into a tourist trap :-p [CR]All of Gouki's voice samples are actually recycled voice samples from the other male characters.[CR]In this Japanese version only, Gouki had two text endings, which translate as follows... [CR]1) -If the last fight was against Vega- [CR]Gouki : Evil Emperor, you say... nothing more than words. Real victory can only come from a fist. That is all. [CR]There was no one to stop Gouki from that moment onwards. [CR]2) -If the last fight was against Gouki- [CR]Gouki : Something within... what's this ? [CR]?? : I am the shadow of the condemned. You have killed the demon of this curse, and so you shall be condemned no more! [CR]Gouki : I now reside in darkness. Even death is beneath me... excellent! [CR]....That man returned to the darkness and disappeared. [CR]The character select music is a remixed version of the music found in the attract mode intro of the CPS1 SFII games. This is the first SFII game not to use some variation of the character select music from the CPS1 games.[CR]Sony Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Super Street Fighter II Arcade Game Track - SRCL-2822) on January 21, 1994.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Old-version Characters : Select your character with LP, then enter the code below while the plane flies to the top of the screen then press LP again. If done correctly you should hear a sound and your character's costume colors in their portrait should change. Old-version characters have no super combos and cannot reduce throw damage... [CR]Old Chun Li : Down(x3), Up [CR]Old Dee Jay : Down(x2), Up(x2) [CR]Old Bison : Down, Up(x2), Down [CR]Old Dhalsim : Down, Up(x3) [CR]Old Ken : Left(x3), Right [CR]Old Fei Long : Left(x2), Right(x2) [CR]Old Vega : Left, Right(x2), Left [CR]Old T. Hawk : Right(x2), Left(x2) [CR]Old Ryu : Right(x3), Left [CR]Old Guile : Up, Down(x3) [CR]Old Sagat : Up, Down(x2), Up [CR]Old Cammy : Up(x2), Down(x2) [CR]Old Honda : Up(x3), Down [CR]* Play as Gouki : At the character select screen, highlight Ryu and hold for 3 sec., highlight T. Hawk and hold for 3 sec., highlight Guile and hold for 3 sec., highlight Cammy and hold for 3 sec., highlight Ryu and hold for 3 sec., press all 3 punches and Start at the same time at the end of you counting. [CR]* Gouki as Final Boss : If you reach the final stage on a single credit (no continues), you will fight Gouki instead of Vega. [CR]* Each character has 8 outfit colors. Press LP to choose the new Super Turbo color, MP for the Champion Edition color, HP for the Hyper Fighting color, any Kick button or the Start button for one of four Super colors, or hold any attack button (except the Start button) for 3 seconds for the secret color. If you use the old version of a character, you will see that character's original "Street Fighter II" color. [CR]* End Credits : If you beat the entire game without continuing, you will get to see the ending credits. If you don't lose a single round, the new ending artwork for each character is shown during the credits. Otherwise, you will see demos of the different characters fighting each other on various stages during the credits.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Street Fighter (1987)[CR]2.

				<plot>Ultimate Ecology (c) 1993 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]Ultimate Ecology is a side-scrolling shoot-em-up with an ecological theme, in which the player must battle a ruthless mega corporation that is slowly destroying the Earth's eco systems with its industrial machines. [CR]As well as superbly rendered graphics, Eco Fighters features an interesting play mechanic with the addition of an extended metal arm mounted on the side of the player's ship. On the end of the arm is a weapon that can be rotated through 360 degrees. This weapon comes in four different forms; Energy Ball, Long-range Hammer, Laser Sword or Scatter-Bomb foil. The rotatable weapon can be powered up before being fired, in a similar fashion to the 'Force' weapon that featured in Irem's "R*Type". The rotatable weapon is also impervious to all enemy contact and can be used as a shield. [CR]In addition to the rotating weapon, the player's ship is also equipped with forward-firing laser guns. Both the guns and rotatable weapon can be powered-up with greater shot power when the relevant icon is picked up.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Green Board [Japan][CR]Players: Up to 2.[CR]Control: 8-way joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 3 per player.[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Ultimate Ecology was originally released in December 1993 in Japan.

				<plot>Vampire Savior - The Lord of Vampire (c) 1997 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]Fifteen characters fight to end the reign of Jedah, the Vampire Savior and save their own souls![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Green Board [Japan][CR]Players: Up to 2[CR]Control: 8-way joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 6 per player.[CR]= &gt; [1] LP, [2] MP, [3] HP[CR]= &gt; [4] LK, [5] MK, [6] HK[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Vampire Savior was released in May 1997 in the Japanese arcades. It was known there as the 22th video game released for the CPS2 hardware.[CR]Known export releases:[CR]"Vampire Savior - The Lord of Vampire [Blue Board]"[CR]"Vampire Savior - The Lord of Vampire [Grey Board]"[CR]"Vampire Savior - The Lord of Vampire [Orange Board]"[CR]Secret Title: Darkstalkers - Jedah's Damnation (hosted in a gfx rom but not used in the game). Some Blue Board copies were hacked to use the 'Jedah's Damnation' title.[CR]Lilith was originally slightly different, in back-story, to the one we know now. She was what is occasionally referred to as a white-wing, with her angelic heritage hidden from view most of the time. This idea was dropped, due to, supposedly, too many angel characters in games. Briefly, She was redesigned as a hermaphrodite, but that too was dropped, most likely due to the fact it would have courted controversy, and instead she was made into part of Morrigan.[CR]Victor Entertainment released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Vampire Savior : Capcom Game Soundtrack - VICL-60098, 60099) on August 21, 1997.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Hidden Warriors : to reach your character's hidden warrior, you must finish the stage without losing any energy bats, and without timeouts. The KO move MUST be an EX Finish. Dark Force or ES Finishes may be acceptable, but an EX Finish is preferred. If you meet this condition, you'll get a 'Here comes a new challenger' prompt as you enter the fourth stage. Each character has their own boss character fights (i.e. Demitri's final boss is Morrigan, Jedah's final boss is Demitri, etc.), and after you finish the first 6 stages, you must defeat your character's boss character in Stage 7 to finish the game. If your character's final boss is Jedah, there will be a special intro scene. [CR]* Play as Original Jon Talbain ('Gallon' in Japan) : at the character select screen, highlight Jon Talbain ('Gallon') and press Start and all three punch buttons at the same time. [CR]* Shoul Mode : on the character select screen, go to the [?] box, press Start 5 times, then push any punch or kick button. [CR]* Alternate Shoul Mode : on the character select screen, go to the character whom you would like to use first stage, press Start 3 times, after go to the [?] box, press Start 5 times, then push any punch or kick button. [CR]* Win Poses : by holding any attack button at the end of a fight, you may choose most of each character's win poses. However, there are a few that can't be seen with this trick, such as Felicia's perfect win pose. [CR]* Tricks : even though the Start button is mostly used as a taunt button, there are a few characters that can use it for some rather silly moves such as Sasquatch &amp; Felicia. [CR]If you leap at the enemy's head without attacking while using Felicia, you'll sit on their heads as long as neither player moves at all. An extra taunt? :) [CR]* EX MOVES : [CR]Anakaris : [CR]1) (3/4 max) In the Sarcophage : Left, DownLeft, Down, DownRight, Right + 2 Punches [CR]2) (1/2 max) Pharao Magic I : MK, LP, Down, LK, MP [CR]3) [Need 2 powers] (1/2 max) Pharao Magic II : HK, MP, Down, MK, HP [CR]4) [Need 3 powers] (1/2 max) Pharao Magic III : HK, MP, LK, Down, LP, MK, HP [CR]B.

Also, because this game was released around the same time as "Super Street Fighter II Turbo", programmers also included Akuma (see Tips And Tricks section for more information).[CR]The game, along with SSFII Turbo, is considered as one of the first fighting games to popularize the now often-used ideas of 'Super Jumps', 'Super Combos', and 'Tech. Hit', which meant that an attempted grab or throw had been negated by the opponent. Furthermore, the game was the precursor to the Capcom 'Vs. series', with elements and characters from this game having been combined with "Street Fighter Alpha - Warriors' Dreams" to create "X-Men vs. Street Fighter".[CR]Sony Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album (X-Men Arcade Game Track - SRCL-3120) on March 24, 1995.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Green Board revisions : [CR]REVISION 1 : [CR]* Software version : 1.00.[CR]* Build date : 941208[CR]REVISION 2 : [CR]* Software version : 2.00.[CR]* Build date : 941217[CR]REVISION 3 :[CR]* Software version : 2.10.[CR]* Build date : 941219 [CR]REVISION 4 : [CR]* Software version : 3.00[CR]* Build date : 950105[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Akuma (Player 1) : Highlight Spiral and wait 3 seconds, then move without stopping through : Silver Samurai, Psylocke, Colossus, Iceman, Colossus, Cyclops, Wolverine, Omega Red and stop on Silver Samurai.

				<plot>X-Men vs. Street Fighter (c) 1996 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]The first 'Capcom vs.' fighter, featuring 16 classic characters and fast-paced tag action.

One difference in this prototype is that Gambit has a different coat color, and his hair is much lighter. The left sleeve of Gambit's coat is white. This was possibly a graphics problem and was fixed in the final version.[CR]X-Men vs. Street Fighter was released in September 1996 in Japan. It was known there as the 20th video game released for the CPS2 hardware.[CR]Known export releases:[CR]"X-Men vs. Street Fighter [Blue Board]"[CR]"X-Men vs. Street Fighter [Grey Board]"[CR]"X-Men vs. Street Fighter [Orange Board]"[CR]"X-Men vs. Street Fighter [Pink Board]"[CR]9 characters are coming from Marvel comic books, followed by their first appearance : [CR]Apocalypse (aka En Sabah Nur) - X-Factor #5 [CR]Cyclops (aka Scott Summers) - X-Men #1 [CR]Gambit (aka Jean-Luc 'Remy' LeBeau) - Uncanny X-Men #266 [CR]Juggernaut (aka Cain Marko) - X-Men #12 [CR]Magneto (aka Erik 'Magnus' Lehnsherr) - X-Men #1 [CR]Rogue - Avengers Annual #10 [CR]Sabretooth (aka Victor Creed) - Iron Fist #14 [CR]Storm (aka Ororo Munroe) - Giant Size X-Men #1 [CR]Wolverine (aka James 'Logan' Howlett) - Incredible Hulk #180 [CR]9 other characters come from several Street Fighter games : [CR]Akuma ('Gouki' in Japan) - "Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challege" in Japan; "Super Street Fighter II Turbo" in all other regions. [CR]Cammy - "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers" [CR]Charlie ('Nash' in Japan) - "Street Fighter Alpha - Warriors' Dreams" in the United States, Canada, and Europe; "Street Fighter Zero" in Japan, Southeast Asia, Brazil, and Hispanic regions [CR]Chun-Li - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" [CR]Dhalsim - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" [CR]Ken Masters - "Street Fighter" [CR]Major Bison ('Vega' in Japan) - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" [CR]Ryu - "Street Fighter" [CR]Zangief - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" [CR]In the game, teams are preselected and the player never encounter random teams. Here are the different teams the player will fight against : [CR]* Cyclops and Ryu [CR]* Zangief and Juggernaut [CR]* Storm and Charlie [CR]* Dhalsim and Sabretooth [CR]* Rogue and Chun-Li [CR]* Bison and Magneto [CR]* Gambit and Ken [CR]* Wolverine and Cammy [CR]Akuma is outside the teams as he is an hidden character (see 'Tips and Tricks' section). After defeating six of these teams, the player's team fights Apocalypse himself! In the end, the character who defeated Apocalypse remains under player control and the other one is the ultimate opponent for the one-on-one final battle. [CR]Blanka (of "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" fame) can be seen hanging out within the background in the 'Death Valley' stage. [CR]Clarence E. Leung holds the official record for this game, on level 5-expert setting, with 2098100 points on March 16, 1999. [CR]Soundtrack releases : [CR]X-Men vs. Street Fighter [Victor Entertainment - VICL-2176 - November 21, 1996][CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Capcom released 3 different revisions of this game in the arcades, and they all have differences: [CR]Version 1 : [CR]* Ryu and Akuma can recover from their hop kick in mid-air. [CR]* Ryu's "Hurricane Super" can push the opposing player down, allowing the player to recover. [CR]Version 2 : [CR]* Ryu and Akuma can not recover from their hop kick [CR]* Sabretooth's jumping Infinite is a little more difficult to time. [CR]* Dhalsim is no longer able to do a "Yoga Drill" the instant he leaves the floor. He actually has to jump a small distance before the Drill will come out. [CR]* Ryu's "Hurricane Super" pushes the opposing player up rather than down. [CR]Version 3 : [CR]* In this version, Capcom removed all of the Infinites they knew of. And some combos have also been removed.

This does some strange things to the life bars, so be careful. It may also screw up the palette for one of the characters on the selection grid, but this will not effect game play.[CR]* Alternate Costume Colors : Highlight a character at the character selection screen then press a Punch button for a darker costume or Kick for a lighter costume.[CR]* Random Fighter : At the character select screen, press and hold left or right for 3 seconds. Note : You can also fight against the same character by getting the random selection to stop on the originally highlighted fighter.[CR]* Continue Attacking : Press Start immediately after winning the match to continue hitting the defeated character.[CR]* Rogue's Additional Winning Pose : After you beat an opponent with Rogue, hold all three punches or kicks before she does her normal win pose (If done correctly, Rogue will turn around and say 'TA-DA!').[CR]* In-game tip messages (These are all the tip messages that randomly appear when the player loses) :[CR]1) HP+HK simultaneously for the Cross-over Attack! You can switch your character at any time![CR]2) Push LP+MP+HP while guarding for the Advancing Guard. Push the opponent back![CR]3) When Air Combo starts to move hits the opponent, put the lever Up to chase him and execute a combo![CR]4) Create a quick combo when fighting in the air! Switch your character when vitality is low![CR]5) Back, Back/Down, Down, P before landing for the safe fall!

You can attack indefinitely while doing a Super Jump![CR]8) Back, Back/Down, Down, HP+HK while guarding for the Counter! Your partner will assist you.[CR]9) When Level 2 or higher, enter Down, Forward/Down, Forward, HP+HK for the cross-over Combination move![CR]10) Vitality recovers slowly while you're resting.

				<plot>X-Men vs. Street Fighter (c) 1996 Capcom Company, Limited.[CR]The first 'Capcom vs.' fighter, featuring 16 classic characters and fast-paced tag action. The mighty Apocalypse is reduced to but a punching bag![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "CP System II" hardware.[CR]Green Board [Japan][CR]Players: Up to 2.[CR]Control: 8-way joystick per player.[CR]Buttons: 6 per player.[CR]= &gt; [1] LP, [2] MP, [3] HP[CR]= &gt; [4] LK, [5] MK, [6] HK[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]In August 1996, a prototype of the game was being tested at several arcades across the countries. One difference in this prototype is that Gambit has a different coat color, and his hair is much lighter. The left sleeve of Gambit's coat is white. This was possibly a graphics problem and was fixed in the final version.[CR]X-Men vs. Street Fighter was released in September 1996 in Japan. It was known there as the 20th video game released for the CPS2 hardware.[CR]Known export releases:[CR]"X-Men vs. Street Fighter [Blue Board]"[CR]"X-Men vs. Street Fighter [Grey Board]"[CR]"X-Men vs. Street Fighter [Orange Board]"[CR]"X-Men vs. Street Fighter [Pink Board]"[CR]9 characters are coming from Marvel comic books, followed by their first appearance : [CR]Apocalypse (aka En Sabah Nur) - X-Factor #5 [CR]Cyclops (aka Scott Summers) - X-Men #1 [CR]Gambit (aka Jean-Luc 'Remy' LeBeau) - Uncanny X-Men #266 [CR]Juggernaut (aka Cain Marko) - X-Men #12 [CR]Magneto (aka Erik 'Magnus' Lehnsherr) - X-Men #1 [CR]Rogue - Avengers Annual #10 [CR]Sabretooth (aka Victor Creed) - Iron Fist #14 [CR]Storm (aka Ororo Munroe) - Giant Size X-Men #1 [CR]Wolverine (aka James 'Logan' Howlett) - Incredible Hulk #180 [CR]9 other characters come from several Street Fighter games : [CR]Akuma ('Gouki' in Japan) - "Super Street Fighter II X - Grand Master Challege" in Japan; "Super Street Fighter II Turbo" in all other regions. [CR]Cammy - "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers" [CR]Charlie ('Nash' in Japan) - "Street Fighter Alpha - Warriors' Dreams" in the United States, Canada, and Europe; "Street Fighter Zero" in Japan, Southeast Asia, Brazil, and Hispanic regions [CR]Chun-Li - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" [CR]Dhalsim - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" [CR]Ken Masters - "Street Fighter" [CR]Major Bison ('Vega' in Japan) - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" [CR]Ryu - "Street Fighter" [CR]Zangief - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" [CR]In the game, teams are preselected and the player never encounter random teams. Here are the different teams the player will fight against : [CR]* Cyclops and Ryu [CR]* Zangief and Juggernaut [CR]* Storm and Charlie [CR]* Dhalsim and Sabretooth [CR]* Rogue and Chun-Li [CR]* Bison and Magneto [CR]* Gambit and Ken [CR]* Wolverine and Cammy [CR]Akuma is outside the teams as he is an hidden character (see 'Tips and Tricks' section). After defeating six of these teams, the player's team fights Apocalypse himself! In the end, the character who defeated Apocalypse remains under player control and the other one is the ultimate opponent for the one-on-one final battle. [CR]Blanka (of "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior" fame) can be seen hanging out within the background in the 'Death Valley' stage. [CR]Clarence E. Leung holds the official record for this game, on level 5-expert setting, with 2098100 points on March 16, 1999. [CR]Soundtrack releases : [CR]X-Men vs. Street Fighter [Victor Entertainment - VICL-2176 - November 21, 1996][CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Capcom released 3 different revisions of this game in the arcades, and they all have differences: [CR]Version 1 : [CR]* Ryu and Akuma can recover from their hop kick in mid-air. [CR]* Ryu's "Hurricane Super" can push the opposing player down, allowing the player to recover. [CR]Version 2 : [CR]* Ryu and Akuma can not recover from their hop kick [CR]* Sabretooth's jumping Infinite is a little more difficult to time. [CR]* Dhalsim is no longer able to do a "Yoga Drill" the instant he leaves the floor. He actually has to jump a small distance before the Drill will come out. [CR]* Ryu's "Hurricane Super" pushes the opposing player up rather than down. [CR]Version 3 : [CR]* In this version, Capcom removed all of the Infinites they knew of. And some combos have also been removed. [CR]Green Board releases : [CR]REVISION 1:[CR]* Build date: 960909[CR]* Version 1[CR]REVISION 2:[CR]* Build date: 960910[CR]* Version 1[CR]REVISION 3:[CR]* Build date: 961004[CR]* Version 2[CR]REVISION 4:[CR]* Build date: 961023[CR]* Version 3[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Akuma : At the character select screen, highlight Magneto or Juggernaut or Dhalsim or Bison and press Up.[CR]* Play as Alpha Chun Li : At the character select screen, highlight Chun Li, hold the Start button and press any action button.[CR]* Play as the Same Character : Enter the random selection code and if you can make it stop on the highlighted character, the highlight will remain there, enabling you to select the same character twice. This does some strange things to the life bars, so be careful. It may also screw up the palette for one of the characters on the selection grid, but this will not effect game play.[CR]* Alternate Costume Colors : Highlight a character at the character selection screen then press a Punch button for a darker costume or Kick for a lighter costume.[CR]* Random Fighter : At the character select screen, press and hold left or right for 3 seconds. Note : You can also fight against the same character by getting the random selection to stop on the originally highlighted fighter.[CR]* Continue Attacking : Press Start immediately after winning the match to continue hitting the defeated character.[CR]* Rogue's Additional Winning Pose : After you beat an opponent with Rogue, hold all three punches or kicks before she does her normal win pose (If done correctly, Rogue will turn around and say 'TA-DA!').[CR]* In-game tip messages (These are all the tip messages that randomly appear when the player loses) :[CR]1) HP+HK simultaneously for the Cross-over Attack! You can switch your character at any time![CR]2) Push LP+MP+HP while guarding for the Advancing Guard. Push the opponent back![CR]3) When Air Combo starts to move hits the opponent, put the lever Up to chase him and execute a combo![CR]4) Create a quick combo when fighting in the air! Switch your character when vitality is low![CR]5) Back, Back/Down, Down, P before landing for the safe fall! Outsmart your opponent![CR]6) By charging the gauge past level one, you can do a Hyper Combo! Make a comeback![CR]7) Enter Down, Up or LK+MK+HK for a Super Jump! You can attack indefinitely while doing a Super Jump![CR]8) Back, Back/Down, Down, HP+HK while guarding for the Counter! Your partner will assist you.[CR]9) When Level 2 or higher, enter Down, Forward/Down, Forward, HP+HK for the cross-over Combination move![CR]10) Vitality recovers slowly while you're resting. When grabbed, enter Forward MP(HP) immediately![CR]11) You'll escape from the throw move! Forward, Forward or LP+MP+HP for the forward dash![CR]12) Get into the striking distance at once!
