		<emu_comment>No Intro Super Famicom (SFC) List by Zach Morris.  This list is filtered to remove duplicates, betas, etc.[CR]Super Famicom was the Japanese released version of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (also known as the Super NES, SNES or Super Nintendo).  The SFC is a 16-bit video game console that was released by Nintendo between 1990 and 1993. In Japan and Southeast Asia, the system is called the Super Famicom (officially adopting the abbreviated name of its predecessor, the Family Computer), or SFC for short.[CR]Although each version is essentially the same, several forms of regional lockout prevent the different versions from being compatible with one another. The Super Famicom was Nintendo's second home console, following the Nintendo Family Computer (NFC). The console introduced advanced graphics and sound capabilities compared with other consoles at the time. Additionally, development of a variety of enhancement chips (which were integrated on game circuit boards) helped to keep it competitive in the marketplace. The SNES was a global success, becoming the best-selling console of the 16-bit era despite its relatively late start and the fierce competition it faced. The SFC remained popular well into the 32-bit era, and although Nintendo no longer offers factory repairs/replacement or accessories for the console, it continues to be popular among fans, collectors, retro gamers, and emulation enthusiasts, some of whom are still making homebrew ROM images.[CR]Developer:  Nintendo[CR]Manufacturer:  Nintendo[CR]CPU:  16-bit 65c816 Ricoh 5A22 3.58 MHz[CR]Memory:  128kb[CR]Graphics:  N/A[CR]Sound:  8-bit Sony SPC700[CR]Display:  512 Ã— 239[CR]Media:  Cartridge[CR]Max.

			<plot>Years ago humanity abandoned the over-polluted Earth to make a new home on Mars. Now, without warning, a mechanical moon has appeared in the skies over Mars, and is raining down destruction on the colonies. A plan is hastily put into action to destroy the moon and its armada of space-craft. Due to the impossible task of surviving a direct assault, the mission is code-named Acrobat Mission.[CR]Your spaceship in Acrobat Mission is capable of firing a single straight ahead shot. By picking up a Wide upgrade, more shots are added that fly off at an angle, and the shot can be charged up to unleash a continuous short range cone of energy. Picking up a Hurricane upgrade will cause bullets to circle you defensively before shooting forward, and charging will store a full round of bullets up to be fired straight ahead all at once. Up to two bombs can be held at once, and if an enemy bullet hits a bomb it will detonate, saving your ship from damage. If your ship is hit, however, then you will have a few seconds to ram it into whatever shot you and take them down with you. Unlike most scrolling shooter games contact with an enemy ship will not kill you, but they can still push you into the path of bullets.[CR]Play takes place over five levels, first of your launch on Mars, then the approach to the moon, and finally infiltrating the base to destroy its core. Each level ends with a unique boss except stage 4, which ends with 3 bosses.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The title screen of the Super Nintendo version[CR]ActRaiser is a Super Nintendo Entertainment System city-building simulation and action hybrid. The game was developed by Quintet and published by Enix (before their merge with Square), and the game was released during November of 1991. Although there was a sequel for the game, ActRaiser 2, it completely abandoned the simulation aspects of the original, which caused many fans to dislike it.[CR]ActRaiser was also released in 2007 on the Wii Virtual Console in Europe, North America, and Japan. European mobile phones got a version of the game with a 2004 release as well. The game was also part of the Nintendo Super System, an arcade system that allowed gamers to preview upcoming releases.[CR]ActRaiser is a relatively well-received game. It was accepted into GameSpot's Greatest Games of All Time in 2003 and was rated the 150th best game on a Nintendo system by Nintendo Power.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Not much of a plot exists in the actual game itself in ActRaiser. However, much is explained via the instruction booklet. The instruction booklet states that Tanzra and his six guardians attacked the Master. The Master was injured after the long battle, so he retreated to his sky palace and proceeded to fall into a deep sleep.[CR]While the Master was sleeping, Tanzra drove the world into ruins. He divided the world into six lands with each being ruled by one of the guardians. When the Master awakes, fully rejuvenated, he is ready to free the world from the oppression of Tanzra.[CR]After defeating Tanzra, civilizations begin to stop worshiping the Master with many losing faith in him and turning to other things. The servant notes this, and says that people only appear to pray and trust to the Master in times of trouble.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In ActRaiser, the player takes control of an incredibly powerful being known only as the Master. The Master has been awakened from a deep sleep to find the world in ruin. He and his loyal servant (a small angelic creature) then set out to rebuild civilization.The Master takes the form of a warrior; here he is battling a boss[CR]To begin this rebuilding process, the Master positions his sky palace above an area filled with enemies and demons. Then, the Master takes on the form of a strong warrior wielding a large sword. In these side-scrolling areas, the warrior uses his sword to dispatch many hazards, such as environmental hazards or monsters. The warrior can pick up power-ups by destroying statues situated in certain places around the level. The power-ups have a variety of effects, from healing the warrior, to bonus points. After defeating the boss of the level, the warrior moves onto the next section of the city-building portion.[CR]The life bar that the Master has in his warrior form can also be extended as the Master gains levels. Leveling up is done through an experience system, in which the combined population of the Master's rebuilt towns amasses into experience. Also gained in leveling up is more SP, which can then be used to preform miraculous events in the city-building part of the game. Magical spells can also be granted to the Master through his followers that he can use in his warrior form. These spells deal significantly more damage than regular attacks, making them essential to the completion of the game.[CR]In the city-building portion of the game, the player takes control of the Master's servant, a small cupid-like creature. Each town begins with only two humans, who then follow the Master's commands and aid him in rebuilding his world. They must be guided (the direction they are guided in is where they will build), and in turn will build houses, roads, and farms. The villagers eventually gain use of other skills, such as composing music or creating bridges.Building a city[CR]The Master also has the use of several magical powers in the city-building portion. He can summon lightning, rain, sun, wind, or earthquakes. Using these abilities, trees, rocks, snow, monsters, and much more can be cleared. In a few sections of the game, the abilities must be used to assist the villagers, starting windmills or putting out fires, for example.[CR]However, the city-building isn't calm. There are several Monster Lairs scattered around the map. Monsters are spawned out of these lairs. The people have the ability to seal these lairs, making it a necessity to guide the population to the lairs. The cupid can attack the monsters using his arrows, but once he loses all of his life, he cannot attack until the people increase in population. Once all of the Monster Lairs are sealed, the people can gain even more advanced technology and techniques.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Symphonic Suite from ActRasier[CR]The critically acclaimed 16-bit soundtrack was composed by Yuzo Koshiro. Brad Shoemaker described it as:[CR]Orchestral video game soundtracks are the norm these days, but back then, the realistic instrument samples really brought out the beauty of Koshiro's aural backdrop. Even though it was a first-generation SNES game, ActRaiser's score remains one of the finest on the system[CR]On Sep. 21, 1991, Koshiro released a 'Symphonic Suite From ActRaiser' CD that used a full orchestral arrangement for the soundtrack. It contained the following 10 tracks:[CR]#[CR]Track Name[CR]Duration (30:40)[CR]1[CR]Opening ~ Tenkujo ~ Blood Pool ~ Casandora[CR]4:20[CR]2[CR]Intermezzo I[CR]0:18[CR]3[CR]Filmoa[CR]2:53[CR]4[CR]Intermezzo II[CR]0:31[CR]5[CR]Aitos ~ Temple ~ Korin ~ Sekaiju[CR]5:19[CR]6[CR]Intermezzo III[CR]0:20[CR]7[CR]Pyramid ~ Marana ~ Seijyaku ~ North Wall[CR]5:56[CR]8[CR]Hitobito no Tanjyo ~ Sasagemono[CR]3:06[CR]9[CR]Maju Arawaro ~ Kyoteki ~ Satan[CR]3:18[CR]10[CR]Heiwa na Sekai ~ Ending[CR]4:39[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hidden Extra Lives[CR]Here is how to find four hidden extra lives in the game's towns: [CR]Fillmore - When you get the Compass, use it here.

			<title_clean>Akumajou Dracula</title_clean>
			<plot>A century of Transylvanian tranquility is about to come to a shocking end. Once again the mortifying screams of helpless villagers shake the ground as they huddle against new nightmarish horrors unleashed by the Duke of Darkness, Count Dracula. And this time he has a tombstone with your name on it, Simon Belmont.You must descend into Castle of the Undead and its gruesome ground, accompanied by the most chilling sound effects to ever tingle your spine. Inside, a freshly dug 11 levels maze features the treacherous Terrace of Terror, the dangerous Rotating Dungeon, the Sunken Ruins of Lost Spirits, torture chambers and creature filled caves. Use your whip like a grappling hook and swing past hundreds of traps and a host of ghost freaks, living corpses and hidden goblins. All while dodging or destroying the unpredictable spitting lizards, carnivorous coffins, and more.Find the concealed weapons needed to defeat everything from eerie phantoms to haunted furniture. Then prepare to find yourself face-to-thing with hideous torments like the Tongue Lasher, the Darkest Knight, the Bone-Afide Horseman and the Granite Crusher. When your nerves get shot, use your password and take a breather. But forge on, Simon Belmont, because if you though Dracula was down for the count, he's only just begun to fright![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Codes[CR]Note:  When you reach the screen that says ''Enter Your Name'' leave the space blank, do not enter a name or the password will not work. [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Stage passwords[CR]Note: When you come to ''Enter your name'' Leave the space blank or these passwords won't work.       [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Full Arsenal[CR]In the last stage, before you climb the stairs to Dracula, jump down to the left.   You will land on an invisible platform.   Move all the way to the left of the screen and you will get full health, 99 hearts, a cross, a full upgraded whip, and a III stone.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Full Arsenal[CR] There are three hidden branches from the main path in this game.  [CR] The first one is in stage 3-1. There will be a point where you must descend a short vertical shaft. Halfway down here is a wall of pillars to the left. These can easily be demolished, where you will find a small side room containing hearts, cash bags, and some Roast.  [CR] The second secret, which is an actual hidden Block, is in stage 6-2. At the very beginning you'll need to pass a hallway with Axe Knights and falling chandeliers. The third archway has a chandelier but no guard. Hit the floor a couple of times and it'll crumble, revealing a stairwell into a secret area.  [CR] The last one is in Block 9-2. The third section has you jump across a bed of spikes at the beginning. After this you'll see several whirlwind tunnels and some coffins. The last upper platform on the right has a coffin and a tunnel. Let the tunnel suck you in and you'll find a hidden area full of bonuses.</plot>

He has summoned his dark minions-Cerberus, Minaurus, and the Salamander-to bring a reign of terror on the land.Grab your whip and try to defeat these dark forces in this new conversion of the hit Japanese game: DRACULA X&amp;trade;. The 7+ stages unfold with myriad possibilities depending on the choices you make during the game. This multi-ending, multi-story feature takes you through many levels of adventure. You must stategically use magical tomes, mystical power-ups and titanic weapons to defeat the horrifying bosses and discover secret bonus levels.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Extra 1-ups[CR]To get an extra 1-up, beat each stage without getting hit. If you come out unscathed (no, you cannot get hit and eat a frankfurter), you will recieve a 1-up after every stage you complete.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Extra 1-ups[CR]After collecting the Key item which goes into your sub-weapon box in Stage 3, if you have 15 hearts or more, use the ItemCrash button. While to most people it seems to do nothing more than make a question mark appear over your head, if the key itself makes contact with an enemy or boss during this brief animation, they'll sustain heavy damage. The best part of this secret is while you must have 15 hearts or more to enable the itemcrash, actually using it consumes ZERO hearts allowing the attack to be used continuously! It also has the highest attack power killing most enemies in a single hit even if used regularly as well (Up + Attack) and once again consumes no hearts however to balance it's attack power, it's also the closest range "weapon" in the game needing to be used immediately in front of the enemy.</plot>

			<plot>The town of Gouto hosted a miraculous artifact, the Key of Resurrection. The evil wizard Oswald invaded the town with his army of goblins and dragons. Three brave knights went out to defend the homeland, and one of them was killed in battle. His wife and his daughter Sophia left the house crying, but Oswald was already in the town, and with one strike he killed Sophia's mother...[CR]Fast-forward ten years. In a nearby town lives a young brave warrior named Albert. He just turned sixteen, and he undergoes an initiation as a descendant of brave heroes of the past. Meanwhile, Sophia became the court wizard of the kingdom. She hasn't forgot the murder of her parents, but she needs the help of a brave warrior like Albert to avenge their death and to stop Oswald...[CR]"Albert-Odyssey" is a console-style strategy RPG. The story is told in cut-scenes between battles and traveling within towns.

			<title_clean>Albert Odyssey 2 - Jashin no Taidou</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Albert Odyssey 2: Jashin no Taidou ("Albert Odyssey 2: Sign of the Devil") is a Super Famicom SRPG and the sequel to the 1993 Super Famicom game Albert Odyssey. It is set ten years later and follows a new protagonist, Dean, who trains to become a warrior after being inspired by the exploits of Albert: the hero from the first game. Dean's quest to stop an evil god, Okutoba, leads him to many of the same locations and NPCs from the original Albert Odyssey.[CR]The game uses a tactical map screen for its combat. The player moves their units around this map and positions them to fight other units - either up close or at a distance depending on the character's skills and weapons. The game uses Mode 7 to depict this grid map as a concave landscape. Similar to Intelligent Systems' Fire Emblem, each time two units meet the game switches to a 2D animated cutaway that displays the exchange of damage.</plot>

			<title_clean>Angelique</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Angelique is a dating sim otome game developed by Ruby Party, a division of Koei consisting fully of females. It was originally released on September 23, 1994 for the Super Famicom, and has since been ported countless of times, often including additional features.[CR]The player assumes the role of Angelique Limoges, a young woman chosen by the Queen of the known Cosmos to one day succeed her. In order to do this, she must populate a kingdom she has been given before her rival and fellow Queen candidate, Rosalia, can do the same. Angelique can call upon the help of nine male guardians who help regulate various aspects of the kingdoms, as well as send them to sabotage her rival's kingdom. If the player wins the contest, Angelique becomes the new Queen. She can also choose instead to wed one of the nine guardians, any of whom can be courted, and sacrifice her throne for true love.[CR]The original Angelique spawned several enhanced versions: Angelique Special; Angelique Voice Fantasy; and Angelique Duet.[CR]Version Differences[CR]Angelique Special[CR]Angelique Special was the first port of the game. It was originally released on December 22, 1995 for PC-FX, and was later ported to PC, Sega Saturn, and PlayStation on March 29, 1996. It adds to the game voice acting by several big-name voice actors, in addition to new animated cutscenes. The PC version is said to be extremely hard to find.Angelique Voice Fantasy[CR]Angelique Voice Fantasy was released on the very same day as Angelique Special, and adds all of the voice acting found in Angelique Special to the original SFC game using a CD and an add-on deck called Voicer-kun.Angelique Duet[CR]Angelique Duet is the latest revision of the Angelique game. It was originally released on July 30, 1998 for Sega Saturn and PlayStation, and later ported to the Nintendo DS on April 6, 2006. The biggest addition to the game is the option to play as not only the usual heroine Angelique Limoges, but also her rival Rosalia de Catargena.[CR]		</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Appleseed: Prometheus no Shintaku ("Oracle of Prometheus") is a side-scrolling shooter from Kan's and Visit. It is based on the cyberpunk sci-fi manga and anime Appleseed by Masamune Shirow, who worked on it before creating Ghost in the Shell. Two ESWAT members, Deunan Knute (a blonde female human with impeccable marksmanship) and Briareos Hecatonchires (a towering male cyborg with an enormous amount of strength), must protect the fledgling utopian nation of Olympus: one of the last bastions of humanity in a planet ravaged by the apocalyptic World War 3.[CR]The game is a standard side-scrolling shooter. The characters have their standard handgun side-arm and a special sub-weapon with finite ammo that is different for the two. They also have a number of grenades which they can throw at any time. The player must make their way through various missions, getting briefed each time.[CR]The game uses the Greek mythological figure Prometheus in its title, a naming convention with the four editions of the manga.</plot>

First, you must be at Decatas with your Aqutallion party (ideally, right after Morgan gets you into the town).  Swap to the Kustera party, and walk to Decatas, but DO NOT FIGHT IN ANY BATTLES.  If you encounter an enemy, run away.  When you get to Decatas, use Morgan's hole to get inside, then walk inside the building with Uncle Save.  Talk to the other person behind the counter, and they will offer to bribe the guards away from the front gate.  Ordinarily, this will cost 1000G, but on some occasions, no money will be deducted but the guards will still be gone, and on other occasions, Kustera will be left with 9,999,999G!  It does not always work, so do not worry if it does not work for you the first time you try it.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Optional Kustera members[CR]Several Kusteras are found throughout the game that are not normally obtained through the main story.  Here is how to get them.</plot>

			<plot>Tonight is the night of the thousand years full moon! At this moment, four brave warriors are rushing up a steep, narrow mountain pass to an ancient ruined shrine. There, they will battle the Dark Lords of Castomira, and ultimately confront the Dark Sorceress. These warriors have pledged their lives to the troubled king of Arcus to recapture the mighty Sword of Light, which Castomira has stolen - the weapon used by Princess Leaty to defeat Castomira a thousand years before this night. They are Jedda the swordsman, Erin the warrior-maiden, Diana the archer, and Bead the magic stick-fighter. To defeat the enemy, the warriors will call upon their individual magic powers: Jedda will wield his fire magic; Erin will harness the power of the wind; Diana will use her healing rays of light; and Bead will mimic the magic of the dark lords. They must not falter in their quest, or the diabolical Castomira will assume absolute power, and darkness will reign... forever.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Bead Passwords[CR]On the main menu, select Password and enter any one of the following:[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Bead Passwords[CR]On the main menu, select Password and enter any one of the following:[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Bead Passwords[CR]On the main menu, select Password and enter any one of the following:[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Bead Passwords[CR]On the main menu, select Password and enter any one of the following:[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Duplicate Inventory[CR]Start the game in two-player mode and let player two die.</plot>

You are Ariel, a little girl who lives with her old wise grandmother in a small house near a mountain range, north to the forest.

But what starts as a simple assignment soon develops into the quest for magic powers of Aretha, the ultimate battle against the evil, and the discovery of Ariel's own true identity.[CR]The game is a console-style RPG, where Ariel and her party travel on the world map, through forests, mountain paths, and caves, occasionally visiting towns and fighting monsters in turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, using a variety of physical and special attacks.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Debug Mode[CR]On the title screen, press UP, LEFT, A, B, DOWN, RIGHT, L, R, UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, X, Y, SELECT, B.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Aretha II: Ariel no Fushigi na Tabi ("Aretha II: Ariel's Mysterious Journey") is a role-playing game developed by Japan Art Media and published by Yanoman Corporation for Game Boy and Super Nintendo platforms. It is the sequel to the first Super Famicom Aretha. Ariel is once again called into action to save her friends Kyle and Doll (Dole) from peril.[CR]The game has a novel equipment creation system that uses the colored souls of enemies to craft new gear depending on the configuration of colors the player uses. The player's party is dictated by the player's place in the story with characters joining and leaving at various points, similar to Final Fantasy IV. The eponymous heroine is the only constant.[CR]The game should not be confused with Aretha II for the Game Boy. The original three Game Boy Aretha games were released several years earlier and have a separate arching storyline.[CR]							</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Asameshimae Nyanko ("Piece of Cake Kitty") is a 1994 puzzle game that plays similarly to Reversi. Players must place two tiles of their color on either side of one of more pieces of the opponent's color, which flips the opponent pieces and makes them the player's. In Asameshimae Nyanko, these pieces are cats, and occasionally the player will be forced to "fight" enemy cats to take them over. These fights are simple button mashers, where the player that mashes hardest will win.[CR]The game was released exclusively for the Super Famicom and never saw an English localization.</plot>

			<title_clean>Ashita no Joe</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ashita no Joe ("Tomorrow's Joe") is a boxing game based on the manga of the same name. In English, the title is sometimes translated as Rocky Joe or Success Joe, as was the case with the earlier Neo Geo Ashita no Joe title Legend of Success Joe, which saw a US localization.[CR]The game follows the manga somewhat, presenting a series of increasingly more challenging fighters for the gifted bantamweight Joe Yabuki, the protagonist, to fight. The game plays a little more like a traditional fighter game than something like Punch Out!!, presenting a side view of the two fighters with a combat system that involves punching and blocking.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Get The Real Ending[CR]To get the real ending of the game, instead of beating the last boxer, let the time run out (easier said than done!) and you'll unlock the real ending of the game.</plot>

			<title_clean>Bahamut Lagoon</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] The battle field screen.Gameplay in Bahamut Lagoon is like that of a Tactical RPG, but with a variety of twists. Each character unit on the battle field represents a party of characters and is associated with a dragon unit. Character units are actually a party of 4 characters that can engage in combat through either a single command or series or a set of individual commands through a sub-battle system that looks and feels like a traditional turn based RPG (such as Final Fantasy).The battle field combat is turn based in an I-Go-You-Go style. The player has a turn, followed by the enemy. The order of units is selected by the player, and all units must be issued a command for the turn to end.Character units are selected and can be moved. They use either field abilities, attack, or issue a state to their respective dragons. When using a field ability the unit attacks as a group through a single command. This form of command is similar to other Tactical RPGs (such as Shining Force). When using the attack command, a sub battle screen appears showing the enemy party on the left and the player party on the right. Commands are then issued for each party member. After the player party acts, the enemy party also gets the chance to react with a series of commands for its own party. These battle sequences take only a single turn.The sub-battle party screen.Dragons are partly autonomous, receiving only three commands which set their state of action. The player does not move them directly. They can be told to Come, Go, or Wait. The Come command keeps the dragon close to its associated character unit, attacking enemy units that are nearby. Go sends the dragon to attack at will. Wait retreats the dragon into a defensive position. If a dragon unit dies it impacts on its respective character units abilities.Character parties and their associated dragons can be reconfigured to the players liking. Dragons can also be fed items outside of battle to improve their stats. Improvements in stats cause the Dragons to transform into new types of dragon.   [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR] Fahrnheit, flaghip of Kahna.Bahamut Lagoon takes place in a world called Orelus. It is made up of floating islands called Lagoons and home to Dragons. The major lagoons are watched over by a Holy Dragon, Bahamut is the Dragon who watches over the Kingdom of Kahna. However, when Kahna is conquered by the Granbelos Empire, Bahamut does not defend it, and as a result its princess is captured and sadness fills the skies of Orelus. The lead protagonist, Byuu, and his Dragon Squad set up a resistance. Their goal is to free the kidnapped princess of Kahna and remove the sadness from the skies. After recovering their missing Dragons, they set out to take back the flagship of Kahna, which they name Fahrnheit.The Emperor of Granbelos, Sauzer, has acquired the power to communicate with the Holy Dragons. He seeks to take control of them and rule over all of Orelus. Princess Yoyo of Kahna also possesses the ability to communicate with the Dragons. Upon doing so, the Dragons are awakened and they both fall ill. However, not only do the Dragons awake, but a portal is also created to another dimension called Altair. Altair, ruled by the most powerful Dragon, Alexander, is the home of demons who begin to attack Orelus. Alexander seeks the power of the other Holy Dragons for himself.Upon overthrowing Granbelos Empire, Sauzer dies of his illness. Before departing he reveals that he made a pact with the demons of Altair in order to gain the ability to communicate with the Holy Dragons. It is left up to Byuu, his comrades, and the Holy Dragons to venture to Altair to defeat Alexander and save Orelus.   [CR]Release[CR]The fan translation is colorful to say the least.The game was only released in Japan for the Super Famicon (SNES). It has never had an official English translation. However, an unofficial fan translation ROM patch by the translation group DeJap exists as of 2002. The translation has a reputation for its humor and rude language.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Secret characters[CR]There are 3 secret characters. A light armor and two ninjas, users of ninjutsu.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Ex Game[CR]Once you clear the game once, hit reset at the ending screen, and you'll notice a new option on the title screen, ''Ex Game''.

			<plot>The game is set in the end of Edo period in Japan (1600-1868). Japan, controlled by the feudal rulers (shoguns) of the Tokugawa dynasty, consumed by a peaceful sleep for three hundred years, was awoken by the arrival of the Westerners. It seemed that they only wanted the end of Japan's isolation from the rest of the world. But their true purpose was to take control of a mysterious Japanese energy source called reiketsu. To protect those sources, that were running dry during their three hundred years-long reign, the Tokugawa Shoguns formed the famous Shinsengumi special force. In addition to its primary mission of clearing out forces that would try to overthrow the shogunate, there also existed a special branch of them called "Shadow Shinsengumi". The duty of the "Shadow" was to take care of "those things the human hand cannot manage"...[CR]You control Yamatomaru, a strong-willed sixteen-year-old boy who lives in Iida village, near Koufu. His father has recently passed away. After failing to defeat a monster in his village, he was saved by one of the Shadow Shinsengumi man, Mibu Juurota. As he receives his father's katana, he goes on his first mission - rescuing boys who were trapped in a mountain path. Soon the plot thickens and the young hero becomes involved in mystical struggles between the forces who try to control reiketsu...[CR]The gameplay is similar to  Dragon Quest  series and other console-style RPGs: the battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. You fight using physical attacks and a variety of special moves based on spiritual energy. An unusual addition to the gameplay is the karma system. By doing good deeds you can increase your karma level, in an  Ultima-like way. This way you get more money and precious items from fighting monsters, and your special powers increase in strength. If you don't show compassion, steal people's things and lie, your karma will decrease, you won't get money from random battles, and some people will attack you.</plot>

			<plot>This game is a strange hybrid of Shining Force and Contra. That\'s the best way to describe it. It\'s a military strategy game in which your team of up to eight members has to complete a set of objectives in order to clear rounds. The game is fairly simple when it comes to gameplay, but you can customize your characters\' name and weaponry. Sometimes, the difference between a long range rifle and a Luger can make or break a game.[CR]The game doesn\'t seem very complicated at the start, but as the missions get progressively harder, you have to plan out moves ahead of schedule, making sure that your enemies don\'t sneak up on you or remain hidden. PROTIP A hint: Use the Search command to look ahead! That\'s a very valuable weapon, so use it often.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]There are some emu-related bugs in the game, but overall, it's playable, so go snipe some enemy troops![CR]Reviewer: Kitsune Sniper [CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/848/</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Barbarossa is a turn-based strategy game set during World War II. The player controls a senior Wehrmacht officer in charge of several troops as Nazi Germany begins their 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, which was codenamed Operation Barbarossa. The player has four years with which to cross the map from Berlin to Moscow and conquer the Russian capital before Hitler dies and Nazi Germany surrenders in 1945.[CR]The game plays similarly to other strategy war-sims of the era, such as Famicom/Nintendo Wars or Military Madness (for instance, it uses a hexagonal spaces on the map). Each unit on the map - comprised of several instances of the same unit type - has their own stats concerning attack power, fuel consumption, maintenance costs and mobility. Whenever two units meet in combat, the view changes to present a dramatic enactment of the battle.[CR]The game was never released outside of Japan, possibly because Nazi Germany is the only playable side.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Debug mode[CR]At the title screen press in order the following buttons.

			<title_clean>Battle Jockey</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Battle Jockey is a racing game for up to four players that was developed by Nova and published by Virgin Interactive exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom.[CR]It features horseracing, a far more popular pastime in Japan than elsewhere, and presents three separate modes: the first is the standard single-player story mode, in which the player takes a horse and jockey through training and races; the second is a battle mode which pits up to four players against each other in races that have far more power-ups and other unusual additions to the game's courses; and the third is a passive gambling mode in which the player puts money down on horses depending on their odds of winning and subsequent payouts and then watches the race play out with CPU players.[CR]The standard mode involves carefully managing the horse's stamina: being too aggressive will cause it to rear up in protest. Falling behind or running into a hedge or jump will cause the horse to lose stamina, and losing all stamina causes it to collapse briefly. The player needs to keep a steady pace, steer carefully around corners, jump at the right times and use the boost sparingly in order to win. In the battle mode stamina is less of a concern and the game more resembles RC Pro-Am: the players have to simply follow the course and avoid the dangers as they show up.</plot>

			<title_clean>Battle Zeque Den</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Battle Zeque-Den is a 2D side-scrolling single-plane brawler for the Super Famicom, developed by Arsys Software and published by Asmik Corporation. Three magically-gifted martial artists fight the forces of darkness to restore the world's balance. The player can choose from any of the three playable characters: Rufu, the redheaded fighter who attacks with the fire element; Kairu, the purple-haired water magic-user; and Hamusu, a younger heroine with boxing gloves and earth-based magic.[CR]Like Sega's Golden Axe, each character has a limited number of character-specific spells which help to clear the immediate area of enemies, though they largely rely on punches, kicks, flying kicks and throws. There's also some small amount of platforming (the characters have a double jump to make it easier to reach higher ledges) and items that restore magic and health.</plot>

Bingo is a bingo- and gambling-focused mini-game collection that allows the player to play four different variations on the conventional game of bingo, as well as three additional mini-games.[CR]The Bingo games include a slot machine, which randomly spits out a random number; a pirate ship cannon, which also spits out a random number but players can narrow it down to a band of numbers (each row is color-coded); Mode-7 skydiving where players can land on the numbers they want with a little skill; and the game's Amidar-themed (the game namedrops the Konami Arcade classic) bingo game features Santa Claus as the game was released a few days before Christmas, and players select a route for him to follow to the bottom of the screen.[CR]The three other mini-games are arm wrestling which requires mashing the button, whack-a-creature with a harisen that uses all four face buttons, and the equestrian sport of horseracing where players can bet money on the outcome of races.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bishin Densetsu Zoku: The Legend of Bishin, or simply Zoku: The Legend of Bishin, is a combination brawler/vehicular combat game from Magifact. The player can choose between two characters, male or female, and must rescue the one they didn't choose. The antagonists are the all-female Bishin (meaning "beautiful" or "graceful") gang, who control the dystopian Japanese capital Neo-Tokyo.[CR]The game was released exclusively for the Super Famicom in Japan. [CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The future.[CR]In the year 2020, Mount Fuji catastrophically erupts, destroying much of the Tokyo metropolitan area. The city survives and is repaired, but is marginalized and becomes overrun with gangs. One gang stands above the others, the entirely female Bishin gang led by the fierce Ryoko. Kouji and Risa won't stand for this, and are going to take the Bishin down through a combination of racing and violence![CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]These ladies play dirty.[CR]Depending on which character is selected at the beginning, either Kouji or Risa will be kidnapped by the Bishin and the player character will be beaten senseless and dumped some distance from the city. The player then has to race their way back through various areas with various events occurring to make it back. During the racing sequences, nitro tanks which can be used to boost speed and repair kits which repair the car are found on occasion. Along the way the player character will have to fight several bosses of the Bishin gang. If they crash their vehicle too much, they are thrown from it and must fight a number of gang members in a typical brawler mode of gameplay. This same mode is also used for the various boss battles.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Kouji[CR]Kouji: The male protagonist. He was apparently a professional boxer at one point before falling from grace. His car is a "Cobra 429 custom". He gets kidnapped if the player select Risa at the beginning.[CR]Risa[CR]Risa: The female protagonist. She was offered a position in Bishin because she's strong, but apparently refused, setting off the conflict. She gets kidnapped if the player selects Kouji at the beginning. She simply uses Kouji's car if he is kidnapped.[CR]Lidera[CR]Lidera: A huge, ugly woman and a low officer of Bishin. She is the boss of the forest area. She is not playable in the versus mode.[CR]Roller and Dozer[CR]Roller and Dozer: Sharing a palette-swapped sprite, these fat women are the bosses of the desert area and developing area respectively. They are also unplayable in the versus mode. Watch out for their Blanka-ball attacks and body splashes.[CR]Lei-Fan[CR]Lei-Fan: An out-of-place member of Bishin, she is fought in the lava area and on the super highway. She is beaten senseless by Flare near the end of the game after she reveals Flare was cheating. She is playable in the versus mode.[CR]Miki &amp; Aki[CR]Miki and Aki: Twins who fight together, they are the boss of the super highway along with Lei-Fan. They have a team-up attack, "crossing shadow". They are playable in the versus mode.[CR]Miyabi[CR]Miyabi: A sadistic, cultured gang member who loves red wine and is armed with a fencing foil. She is the boss of the Bayside highway. She is playable in the versus mode.[CR]Flare[CR]Flare: The number 2 boss of Bishin, she is the first boss in the final stage.

She is the final boss, and has the ability to fire projectiles. She is playable in the versus mode.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]StageDescriptionStage 0, Seaside Highway:Kouji and Risa go to meet up with Bishin reps, but one or the other gets kidnapped!Stage 1, Desert Area:Possibly due to continued environmental decline, a desert has sprung up in Japan.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon ("Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon" or "Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon") is the first video game adaptation of the popular anime of the same name, which in turn was based on a shoujo manga about female high school students who transform into superheroes with planet-related names.[CR]Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon was developed by Arc System Works, back when they were a contract developer producing licensed games for other publishers, and published by Angel (a subsidiary of Bandai) in Japan in August 1993. The game was later released in France as Sailor Moon, mirroring the earlier France-only release of another SNES anime license game Dragon Ball Z: Super Butouden (which was simply named Dragon Ball Z in France). The game did not receive a UK or US release.[CR]Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon would also receive a Sega Mega Drive port in 1994, which was developed and published by Ma-Ba (another Bandai subsidiary). It replaced some of the graphics and stages, and almost all of the music. It also included a new final boss, who only appeared on the game's Hard Mode.Gameplay[CR]The game is a fairly standard brawler, with five playable characters. They include:Sailor Moon - The heroine of the franchise, recognizable by her long blonde pigtails. Standard all-rounder character.Sailor Mercury - The short-haired brunette and the brains of the outfit. She's faster than the other characters, but she's also the smallest and has the shortest reach.Sailor Mars - The long-haired brunette. Sailor Mars is feisty and musically-inclined, and most of her repertoire involves fire in some capacity. Her regular attack is a stronger kick, rather than a punch.Sailor Jupiter - Wears her brown hair in a ponytail. The muscles of the group, Jupiter's attacks are the strongest of any of the playable characters.Sailor Venus - The other blonde. She uses a chain in battle, and is the only character to use a weapon. This gives her a longer reach than the other characters.[CR]The player, as any one of the five Sailor Soldiers, must progress through five different stages which culminates with a trip to the Dark Kingdom to fight Queen Beryl. Each character fights slightly differently, and each has a different special attack which requires charging up before they can be unleashed. Each character also has a special attack that consumes health when used.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Use Same Character in 2P Mode[CR]When the cursor is on Player 2, hold down L and R, and push Start. Now both players can select the same character.</plot>

			<title_clean>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon - Another Story</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sailor Moon: Another Story is a Japanese RPG released in 1995 for the Super Famicom. One of many games developed for the franchise on the SNES platform, it is the only one out those not directly based on any particular season of the anime television show. As the name suggests, the game presents itself as a side story. Though it does feature cameos and references involving characters from seasons 1 and 2, the events in this game aren't tied to Sailor Moon cannon. Like many games in the series, it was never localized or ported to any other platform. This led to a community effort to create a successful fan translation of the game for the use in software emulation.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Another Story fits the build as a Japanese rpg. Random encounters and turn based battles give it that playing field of SNES era games such as    Final Fantasy. An interesting twist on combat was the ability to combine the abilities of any two Sailor Scouts to pull of devastating attacks using each characters signature moves taken directly from the show, similar to the combo system of  Chrono Trigger.When you aren't in battle, Another Story features a nicely designed 2D world to explore with Non-playable characters abound to talk to. The game also features numerous cut-scenes and written dialogue moments for character and plot developments which also play out in similar fashion to    Final Fantasy.[CR]			</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S: Kondo wa Puzzle de Oshioki yo!! ("Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon S: Now It's Puzzle Punishment Time!!") is a puzzle game from Tom Create and published by Bandai. It uses the Sailor Moon anime/manga license and allows the player to play as any of the Sailor Moon soldiers (besides Saturn) or as Tuxedo Mask.[CR]The goal of the game is to remove all the bricks from the playing field. Clicking on a block removes it and every block of the same color that is sitting adjacent (the player cannot remove a block if it is by itself). There are also special icons that, once moved to the bottom of the grid, can be used to clear blocks or otherwise make it easier to clear them. In multiplayer, removing a lot of bricks in one click will drop junk on the other player. Junk blocks cannot be removed directly, but will be removed along with colored bricks if adjacent.[CR]The game has single-player, single-player versus computer and two-player competitive modes. It was never released outside of Japan.[CR]		</plot>

			<plot>[CR]The game uses the same concept as BreakThru!, a game created by ZOO Corporation. It features both one-player and two-player options.[CR]One can play as any one of the Sailor Senshi (minus Saturn) or Tuxedo Kamen. Using the Luna/Artemis heads, you "pop" clusters of similarly-coloured hearts. White hearts will fall down to fill the gaps, which you can turn over by moving your moon kitty over them. Aside from the hearts, the game also features various items with different abilities. Crossbows, which, when "popped", remove all hearts in the direction they face on both sides of the screen. Heart Wands will use your senshi's elemental power on your opponent's side of the screen. Mini Professor Tomoe faces can hatch from greenish, cocoon-like objects, and will destroy any talismans they come in contact with. If you have any on your side of the screen, however, using a Heart Wand will destroy them instead of hindering your opponent. Heart Brooches can remove all hearts of any colour of your choosing on your side of the screen. There are also pink gems that have different effects based on which colour heart is selected after them.[CR]The senshi powers are as follows:[CR]Sailor Moon - Destroys a 3x3 block of hearts/items on the opponent's side[CR]Sailor Mercury - Floods the opponent's side and makes them unable to turn over white hearts for a period of time[CR]Sailor Mars - Burns a few random hearts/items on the opponent's side[CR]Sailor Jupiter - Electrifies a few random hearts on the opponent's side[CR]Sailor Venus - Removes items from the opponent's side[CR]Sailor Uranus - Destroys one column on the opponent's side and clears it for a period of time[CR]Sailor Neptune - Floods the opponent's side and makes white hearts stop falling in for a period of time[CR]Sailor Pluto - Moves the center line over, decreasing the opponent's side by one column[CR]Sailor Chibi Moon - Puts an umbrella in place of an opponent's heart, preventing that column from dropping down for a period of time[CR]Tuxedo Kamen - Stands in front of the opponent's side for a period of time[CR]				</plot>

			<plot>Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon Super S: Fuwa Fuwa Panic is a Sailor Moon themed competitive puzzle game. Players first select a character from among five Sailor Scouts and Chibiusa, each with a unique special move. They will then challenge each other in competition. Each player has a board which contains some balloons, in either red, yellow, green or blue. These balloons can be shot at in order to gain points and fill up the power bar. Balloons of the same color that are adjacent to one another with all be destroyed and generate more points. The goal is to avoid being the player whose balloons are pushed downwards off the board, and to make the opponent receive this fate. As groups of balloons are destroyed, they can reveal power-ups as well as produce black balloons on the opponent's board. Black balloons can only be destroyed by groups of colored balloons being removed adjacent to them. Players with a filled power bar can unleash special abilities.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bombuzal is a puzzle game originally developed by Image Works for many US and European home computers such as the Amiga, the Atari ST and the Commodore 64. The goal is to clear each stage of its bombs by detonating them, all the while remaining in one piece. As stages progress, the game increasingly relies on the "single correct course of action" approach similar to other computer puzzle games like Sokoban or Puzznic. Failure to ascertain this correct path would require restarting the stage, as inevitably the player would end up trapped on an island with bombs remaining (or face an inescapable explode-y fate).[CR]Mirrorsoft's SNES version was released in Japan as Bombuzal, but was renamed Ka-blooey for its US release. The game holds the distinction of being the third ever game to be released on the Super Nintendo console as well as being the first port.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In order to advance to the next level Bombuzal must detonate all the bombs on the level without killing himself. The bombs vary in size and some of them can't be directly detonated, they have to be detonated via a chain reaction. In later levels hazards such as disappearing floors and ice floors are added. The player can switch between viewing modes - an isometric view of the field and a top-down view.[CR]								</plot>

			<plot>The Planet Buster continues the story that was told in the first Brandish game, and depicts the events that happened three years after the evil demonic king was defeated in his lost kingdom, sunken deep underground. You take control of a young warrior named Ares, who wields a magical weapon, a powerful sword called the Planet Buster. One day, while traveling through a desert, Ares is captured by a warlock named Karl, who is after the powers hidden within the magical sword. Suspecting Ares might have some valuable information, Karl doesn't execute him, but takes away the Planet Buster and throws Ares into his underground prison. Now your primary goal is to guide Ares out of the huge prison full of various dangers, and to get your mighty weapon back.[CR]The game is an action RPG with a heavy emphasis on dungeon crawling. You guide Ares through rotating dungeons, fighting enemies in real-time combat, casting spells, and solving an occasional puzzle. You have the ability to jump forwards and to attack inanimate objects such as doors to cause damage and to break the object.</plot>

It is the third game in the series, and the first for the Super Nintendo. As was the case with its forebears, Koutei no Chousen uses a semi-turn-based RPG format in which the player selects commands dependent on whether or not they have possession of the ball. The game follows the story of the manga to some extent.[CR]Besides the obvious graphical upgrade moving from 8-bit to 16-bit, Koutei no Chousen now allows the player to see a map of the pitch to help them strategize.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]On the main menu, press L, R and X, all at the same time, to acess the sound test menu.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Captain Tsubasa V: Hasha no Shougou Campione ("Captain Tsubasa V: Campione Champion Titleholder") is a soccer game based on the anime Captain Tsubasa that utilizes a turn-based system for tackles, passes and kicks. It is the fifth such game developed by Tecmo, as well as the last.[CR]Unlike its four predecessors, Captain Tsubasa V adopts a new gameplay format with a classic view of the pitch. Various characters were based on real-life footballers of the time. Some examples are Peter Schmeichel, Ruud Gullit, Dennis Bergkamp, Gabriel Batistuta and Marco Van Basten.[CR]The Story mode is divided into three major parts: Tsubasa's adventure in the Italian football league, the international campaign with Japan's national football team, and finally Japan in the World Tournament. In addition, there are other playable mini-stories with other original characters from the anime/manga.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Secret Shots[CR]During matchs, try doing this in order to get extra shots.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]On the main menu press Up, Y and B (all at the same time!) to acess the sound test menu.</plot>

Minami no Island!!.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The goal is to move along a board of 28-31 spaces that represent a month, finding helpful items and either gaining or losing money depending on what is found after each roll. The first player to pass the finish line gets a 100 yen bonus, but players that keep rolling low numbers might find themselves with more money in the long run if they're particularly fortunate. Games can be set from 1 month up to an entire 12 months, with the eventual winner decided by the total amount of money earned.</plot>

			<plot>Columns is loosely derived from Tetris, as it involves arranging falling blocks in such a way as to clear them. However, in columns they are groups of 3 same-size but varying color blocks, which must be arranged into sequences of 3 or more, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Sequences of 4 or 5 count for double or triple points, and diagonal sequences score the most. The real trick is to set up 'combos' - where one line causes other blocks to drop so as to create other lines.[CR]As well as the normal game mode, there is also a 'flash' mode, in which the aim is simply to remove a particular block from the base of the pre-formed pile of bricks. The difficulty of this can be determined by increasing the number of complete rows which are already in place.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Conveni Wars Barcode Battler Senki: Super Senshi Shutsugeki Seyo! ("Chronicles of the Convenience Store Wars Barcode Battlers: Roll Out, Super Soldier!") is a strategy RPG from Epoch (developed by SAS Sakata) that is built to work with their Barcode Battler handheld device: a machine that scans barcodes and creates soldiers/monsters with their own individual stats from the data.[CR]Versions of Conveni Wars Barcode Battler Senki were bundled with an adapter device that allowed the Super Famicom to read the Barcode Battler's output and add the creatures it generated to the hero's army in-game. The game also provided default characters for players without the Barcode Battler device (which was sold separately, unlike the adapter).[CR]The game is a spiritual sequel to Epoch's Barcode World, which provided the same symbiosis between the Barcode Battler and the Famicom.[CR]Many of Epoch's later Super Famicom games would have some degree of connectivity with the Barcode Battler, usually providing optional enhanced functions if the right codes are scanned.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Coron Land is an action game released by Yumedia and Aroma in 1995. The game stars Hyou and Kiyu across a variety of stages fighting evil and saving the land of Snowia.Story[CR]On the day of Snowia's annual Winter Festival, a festival that start's spring, an evil villain takes the snow goddess statue, preventing the festivities from happening and keeping the world in winter indefinitely. Because the statue is needed for spring to come, the heroes Hyou and Kiyu go on an expedition to return the statue to it's rightful place and restore order once more.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The basic gameplay of Coron Land consists of shooting enemies with the ray gun, throwing enemies, and throwing purple balls called Corons at enemies. Corons can either be generated from downed enemies (Quest Mode) or from random appearance (Battle Mode). Enemies are turned into corons after a certain amount of hits, but will return to their former forms if not dealt with after a certain amount of time. Once an enemy becomes a coron, players may either choose to immediately throw them as weapons or roll them to make them become bigger and cause more harm to enemies when thrown. This snowball effect also works for corons that are randomly dropped.Quest Mode[CR]The player choses from either the male or female character and then embarks on a quest to eliminate a set of foes through six different stages, including an ice, air, and pinball. Enemies vary from floating wizards, to living bombs, to frantic cats. The occasional item or power up sometimes appear to further assist the player. Items are used to revitalize health or add points to total score and power ups increase the power of the ray gun. Once a level is cleared, point-enhancing fruits are dropped and the next level is loaded. Each level starts the player off on full health and a new arena in the stage to fight in. This mode supports up to two players for co-op.Battle Mode[CR]Typical to any standard battle mode, one to two players fight in several battles against one another and AI until a set amount of wins has been achieved. Players choose from a selection of four characters and six arenas, each that represent a different stage in Quest Mode. Unlike Quest Mode, there are no power ups, items, or enemies, but corons are still in play. This mode uses four players, but only supports up to two players for competition.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]Coron Land also has a sound test mode, which includes the following tracks:Yumedia LogoTitle ScreenStorylineAdventure!Stage ClearEncounter with Evil MonkeyBoss BattleJungleBattle with Evil MonkeyInside the CastleFinal BattleEndingContinue?Snowy WonderlandBackyardPlace Your Bets!Toy FactoryFactoryHigh in the SkyWinner![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Passwords[CR]At the title screen press start, select the last option, and enter the following chain.</plot>

			<title_clean>Cosmo Gang - The Puzzle</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle is a puzzle game from Namco and the second game to feature their Cosmo Gang characters. The Cosmo Gang were originally attached to a group of redemption games (like pachinko or claw machines) from Namco, but would eventually star in two Arcade games: Cosmo Gang: The Video, a Galaga clone, and Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle.[CR]This game would become the basis of Namco's more well-known puzzle game Pac-Attack, featuring Pac-Man. As with Pac-Attack, the idea is to stack up a lot of the animated face icons (members of the Cosmo Gang) in an unbroken chain and then drop a bomb (shaped like an arrow) that goes down the chain and eliminates them all at once.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cosmo Gang: The Video is a single-screen shoot 'em up that greatly resembles Galaga with its gameplay, with enemies swooping in and ship upgrades that can be earned by shooting down the UFO enemy at the top of the screen.[CR]The Cosmo Gang are based on a series of characters that had previously been used by Namco for a redemption game (a type of Arcade machine that dispenses award tokens for winning a rudimentary game, of which pachinko is the most popular variant) the previous year. The subtitle suggests that this is their video game debut. Originally released in the Arcades, Cosmo Gang: The Video was later ported to the Super Famicom. It was followed up the subsequent year with Cosmo Gang: The Puzzle, a Puyo-Puyo style puzzle game that was the basis for Namco's later Pac-Attack.</plot>

			<plot>Once again the universe is at peril from invaders from beyond, but this time their target is Earth! Galivan and company don't have time to find items or level up weapons as in Galivan's previous outing; this is a no holds barred slugfest. Three characters are playable, each with varying stats but basically the same moveset. Each character has a standard straight ahead punch or kick, a sweeping kick, an uppercut, and a ranged attack that must be charged up. At the start of the game and the end of every level the player can add stat points to their character to increase their HP, defense, jump height, and strength of normal and special attacks.[CR]A 2 player versus mode is included as well. Both players can choose from the three main characters, and the second player can additionally choose from one of the four normal enemy types.</plot>

			<title_clean>Crayon Shin-chan - Arashi o Yobu Enji</title_clean>
			<plot>Five-year-old Shinnosuke Nohara is the epitome of noisy children: loud and inappropriate, infuriating to his parents, and hilarious to onlookers. Shin-chan is always getting in trouble with his parents and saying bizarre or offensive things to everyone he meets. Every so often, though, he'll try to do what his mom wants him to, but more often than not, he'll misunderstand and simply confound his parents further.[CR]Arashi o Yobu Enji ("A Kindergartner Called Tempest") is one of many games based on the manga and anime created by Yoshito Usui. In four stages, each made up of five areas, Shin-chan must explore his neighborhood looking for a specific object. He can enter houses to ask people for information, but will often end up simply insulting them. He must also avoid or knock over the other children in the neighborhood, and has various ability cards that he can use to assist him, which might give him a water pistol or refill his health. After finding what he's looking for, Shin-chan will move on to the next area.[CR]Also included is a minigame mode with eight different minigames, such as a bubble-blowing contest, a three-legged race, and a desperate search for clothing before school. The entire game, including the minigames, is filled with dialogue containing the same humor as the source material.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Crayon Shin-Chan 2: Dai Maou no Gyakushu ("Crayon Shin-Chan 2: The Demon Lord's Counterattack") is a platformer based on the Crayon Shin-Chan anime and manga. The player, as the mischievous kindergartner Shin-chan, must rescue his favorite super hero Action Kamen ("Action Mask") from his prison before Action Kamen's supervillain nemesis Haiguremaou can take over both Action Kamen's and Shin-chan's worlds. Many of the bosses are transformed versions of Shin-chan's friends and family.[CR]The game is a standard side-scrolling 2D platformer - common with licensed games - though it is notable for letting players decide which order they want to tackle stages, not to mention the franchise's penchant for weird/gross-out humor. It is the second of three Shin-Chan games to reach the Super Famicom (sandwiched between 1993's Crayon Shin-Chan: Arashi wo Yobu Enji and 1996's Crayon Shin-Chan: Osagusu Dobon) and was never released outside of Japan.</plot>

			<plot>There was once a prosperous kingdom, a peaceful kingdom, ruled by a wise old king, where all peopled lived happily together, protected by the power of a magical crystal. But one day, several dark clouds appeared over the kingdom and poured down a devastating rain. And then one of the clouds turned into a demon, and, reaching its hands to the treasure room in the palace, took the crystal away. The demon lord, still in a form of a menacing dark cloud, started spawning monsters and sending them to attack the now helpless kingdom. The king called to the heavens for help. Eight magical weapons fell on the ground, and eight warriors rose to protect their country. Your task now is to cleanse the land of the monsters and to defeat the evil demon lord.[CR]"Crystal Beans" is an action RPG based on fighting and dungeon crawling. You can play as either of the eight initial character classes: Fighter, Warrior, Bow-man, Wizard, Priest, Kage (a kind of a ninja), Monk, or Witch. In addition, there are four secret classes you discover during your journey. Each class has its own strength and weaknesses, and two unique attack types.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cu-On-Pa SFC is the Super Famicom version of Cu-On-Pa.[CR]Cu-On-Pa is an original puzzle game that was developed by a little-known group called Onesong Partners. This group originally released an obscure game similar to this but with a wider audience in mind, various enhancements and alternate modes for PCs called "Endorfun" in 1995 in the U.S and Europe.[CR]Japanese developers seemed to like the concept and got permission to make something like it based on the original principals of Endorfun for the obscure Satellaview (or BS-X) and then later as a standalone release for the Super Famicom, where the game was called BS Cu-On-Pa and Cu-On-Pa, respectively. It would also get released later for Playstation.[CR]Published by T&amp;E Soft for the SFC late in 1996, Cu-On-Pa was also fan-translated sometime later for the emulation community, though the game comes with a rather straightforward tutorial and the game is very easy to understand, but difficult to master. This game is difficult to describe and in a league of its own.[CR]You play as a three-dimensional cube that must destroy all the "Life Panels" on a level. To do so, you have to rotate your cube and roll over the colored squares on the transparent field. Panels come in a variety of colors and the main way to elimate them is by having the color on the top of the cube match the color of the tile beneath you.[CR]The other way is for more skilled players and comes in the form of "Lightning Panels", which are generated when you destroy panels other than Life Panels. Destroy enough of them and you'll have lots of them. Then go and destroy a life panel! What will happen is, all lightning panels will explode that match the color of the life panel you rolled over. Moreover, the explosion spreads and detonates other tiles in the vicinity, which can spread and create a chain reaction. It's up to you how you wish to rack up points, either by time, chains, or both.[CR]Ken Kojima was the music composer.</plot>

			<title_clean>Cyber Knight</title_clean>
			<plot>In the 24th century, mankind has gone into space. The crew of the starship Swordfish are in an engagement with space pirates when the battle takes a turn for the worse. In desperation, the crew activate their jump drive without a destination... and end up flung across the galaxy to the galactic core. The Swordfish however is badly damaged with many casualties including the captain. Only 26 of the crew survive, and of them only 6 are qualified for combat: The commander, two soldiers, a mechanic and a doctor and six giant "Module" mechanized suits available for them. These survivors locate planet Farworld, apparently colonized by humans. There they discover the colony is under attack by a relentless mechanical aliens dubbed "Berserkers". The crew of the swordfish must fight back against the Berserkers and explore the galaxy for some means to return home.[CR]Cyber Knight is an RPG with a science-fiction theme of being lost in an alien galaxy. The game takes place in a top-down view for movement on planets and areas, a side-view for combat sequences and a first person menu system when aboard the Swordfish starship. The Swordfish can travel between stars, scanning worlds for information. If the ship is able to land on a planet, three crew members piloting three Modules (giant robots) can be selected to debark and explore the planet. Many planets will have towns or people living on them which can be talked to in order to uncover information. Different quests are assigned in order to find the items necessary to progress. There is no system of currency or buying items. Instead, many defeated Berserkers leave behind "NeoParts", which can be brought back to the Swordfish's lab. Analysis of these Neo parts unlocks enhances statistics (endurance, agility, accuracy, etc) for the Modules and new weapons for them to carry. The six modules are unique in statistics, and also the six pilots each carry different skills.[CR]Combat takes place in turn-based combat on a 6x6 squares field. Seen from the side view, the three modules can be positioned in relation to enemies in order to attack, using a variety of melee and long-ranged weaponry. Ammunition is unlimited, but each module also carries a number of "options" that are consumable attacks. Each Module has two sets of hitpoints: one for the pilot and one for the module itself. If either one of these reaches zero, the module is destroyed. In order to heal, the party carries 10 each of repair kits and first aid kits, which must when not in combat. These kits, as well as options and defeated pilots or modules can be restored by returning to the Swordfish.</plot>

Like its 1990 predecessor, Cyber Knight, the game switches between on-foot and mech combat, both of which play out tactically as units are moved around on a grid-like field. The game takes place chronologically after the first game and concerns taking back the Earth from the military dictatorship that has taken it over during the events of the first Cyber Knight.[CR]Like Cyber Knight, the game was fan-translated by the Aeon Genesis group.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cyborg 009 is a side-scrolling run-and-gun action game from BEC based on the anime and manga of the same name. The player can control up to three of eight cyborg agents for each stage, each of which has their own separate set of powers. The player can alternate at any time between the three agents they selected, though as all three share a health and "SP" bar (which determines how often they can use special abilities) there's little point to switching out a character if they are badly hurt.[CR]Cyborg 009 received a fan translation from localization group Aeon Genesis in 2004. The license also saw two other video game adaptations: A Mega CD game in 1993 and a budget PlayStation puzzle game in 2002 that played like BreakOut.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Cyborg 002: A long-nosed former New York gang member named Jet Link. Like his name suggests, his special ability is to move at incredible speeds with his jet boots. In-game, this allows him to reach high places.Cyborg 003: A French ballet dancer and the only female on the team. Rather than an offensive special ability, she has enhanced senses that allows her to "see" through walls. In-game, this means that she can find and use a map to see the whole level, including hidden areas.Cyborg 004: A German with multiple weapons embedded in his body. His special in-game ability is to fire rockets from his knees, which move diagonally upwards after being fired. He can also fire a spread shot version of his regular weapon.Cyborg 005: A large Native American who uses his impressive strength in battle. He is capable of creating a ground pound with a stunning effect, and can shoot fireballs from his hands (similar to Ryu and Ken's hadokens).Cyborg 006: A Chinese cyborg who is able to breathe fire.Cyborg 007: A mysterious bald man known only as Great Britain, which is also his birthplace. Cyborg 007 has the unusual ability of shapeshifting into any creature or person, which in-game allows him to assume the form of enemies native to that stage to elude their detection.Cyborg 008: A guerrilla fighter from the African continent, 008 has the unique ability to survive underwater without losing health. Many levels contain water sections with items within, but the player needs to know in advance where these areas are to make use of him.Cyborg 009: The series protagonist, a young male with a leonine head of hair who has exceptional strength and leaping power. His special ability to move incredibly fast, which has the in-game effect of slowing everything else down.Cyborg 001: A baby with a bowlcut, a genius-level IQ and incredible psychic powers that allows him to use psychokinesis and telepathy, the latter of which he employs to speak to the other Cyborgs as an adult. He also sleeps frequently and is limited by his infant body, and thus is not a playable character.Dr. Isaac Gilmore: The head scientist responsible the Cyborg 00s. He acts in an advisor role to the group, formulating their missions.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dai-3-Ji Super Robot Taisen ("3rd Super Robot Wars") is the third game in Banpresto's immense Super Robot Wars/Taisen series. It was originally released on the Super Famicom in 1993, the first in the series for that particular console, and was rereleased in a compilation for the PlayStation in 1999 (it was also released on PlayStation as a standalone game).[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Six months after the DC War (as chronicled in Super Robot Wars 2), the DC seems to be regaining their former combat strength thanks to the Zabi family. In response, the United Nations has decided to reorganize itself into the Earth Federation.[CR]The heroes of the last war are formed into a unit known as Londo Bell; however, the Earth Federation distrusts them due to their immense power, and provides them with as few resources as they can...[CR]Featured Series[CR]A list of the anime series which are featured in the game. Series that premiered in the Super Robot Wars series in this game are marked with "(new)".Mobile Suit GundamMobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket (new)Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory (new)Mobile Suit Zeta GundamMobile Suit Gundam ZZMobile Suit Gundam: Char's CounterattackMobile Suit Gundam F91Mazinger ZGreat MazingerUFO Robo GrendizerGetter RoboGetter Robo GBrave Raideen (new)Super Electromagnetic Robot Combattler V (new)Invincible Steel Man Daitarn 3 (new)Banpresto Originals (original characters created for the game)[CR]New Features[CR]Interchangeable Pilots: Pilots from the same timeline can use just about any mecha from their respective timeline. For example, Amuro Ray can pilot the Zeta Gundam and Sayaka Yumi (Mazinger Z) can pilot Great Mazinger.[CR]Pilot and Robot Stats: Because of the feature above, pilot and robot stats have been split. For example, HP is handled by the robot while Spirit Commands (seishin) are handled by the pilot.[CR]Ammo and EN System: Many attacks are now limited by ammo count or the robot's EN rating. EN is also drained by moving while flying in the air or in space.[CR]Upgradeable Robots: The player can use their funds to upgrade a robot's HP, EN, Armor, and Limit.[CR]Branching Paths: This game often has seperate paths. The path that the player embarks on is usually chosen in a cutscene, although some are also based on actions on the battlefield. Branching paths have been included in almost every Super Robot Wars game since.[CR]Alternate Endings: There are three endings in this game, one of which includes a secret stage.[CR]Battle Backgrounds: While battles in the first two games took place on a blank screen, SRW 3 uses backgrounds based on where the current unit is standing.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]During any scenario, go to an empty square and press A (menu button), third-last option (SYSTEM), press A (confirm), and go to third option (SOUND).</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Daibakushou Jinsei Gekijou ("Great Hearty Laughter Theater Life") is a Taito board game simulation based loosely on the Jinsei Game, the Japanese equivalent of Milton Bradley's The Game of Life. It is the fourth game in the series and the first for the Super Nintendo.[CR]Each player (with a maximum of four human players) begins as a toddler and ends on retirement age, passing through each stage of life by landing on squares, earning money and increasing/decreasing their stats (which then affects how much money they earn). Each stage of life is a self-contained board and the first player to reach the end earns a bonus, with everyone then proceeding to the next board regardless of how far they've moved. </plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Daibakushou Jinsei Gekijou: Dokidoki Seishun Hen ("Great Burst of Laughter Theater Life: The Heart-Pounding Adolescence Chapter") is the second Super Famicom game in the Bakushou Jinsei Gekijou franchise and the fifth game overall. Like the rest of the series, it is a competitive multiplayer board game that plays similarly to Milton Bradley's The Game of Life, known as the Jinsei Game in Japan.[CR]Unlike Daibakushou Jinsei Gekijou, which carried the player from infancy to retirement age, Dokidoki Seishun Hen focuses entirely on highschoolers. The goal is to learn as much knowledge as possible, earn plenty of money and make their teachers and parents happy. Instead of having a target square to reach in order to continue onto the next phase of the game, the players simply move around a circular board experiencing events every turn as weeks and months pass, with new elements and new areas of the board added after certain dates.[CR]The second game in the Daibakushou Jinsei Gekijou series (the "Dai" was added to Super Famicom entries), it was preceded by Daibakushou Jinsei Gekijou and followed by Daibakushou Jinsei Gekijou: Ooedo Nikki and Daibakushou Jinsei Gekijou: Zukkoke Salary Man Hen.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Daikaijuu Monogatari ("Great Shell Monster Story") is a RPG with monster-recruiting elements and the sequel to the Famicom game Kaijuu Monogatari. Like its predecessor, the player controls the player-named Fire Shell Champion, which grants them dominion over the element of fire. The Champion recruits shell creatures to fight alongside them as he attempts to protect the rest of the shell creature race. Combat follows the standard Dragon Quest turn-based format.[CR]In Daikaijuu Monogatari the Fire Shell Champion is once again summoned into service when a mysterious alien entity crash lands into an ocean, causing a catastrophic tidal wave and spawning mysterious eggs across the world.[CR]The game was followed by a Daikaijuu Monogatari RPG sequel: Daikaijuu Monogatari II. Later sequels would adopt a trading card game format.[CR]												</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Daisenryaku ("Great Strategy") Expert is a military strategy game from SystemSoft and the eighth in their Daisenryaku series. As with many others in the series, the goal is to defeat the other side by taking over key strategic locations, use those locations to produce new units and overwhelm the enemy forces who are busy attempting to do the same to the player. These scenarios play out with one player moving all their units, and then allowing the opponent to take their turn. In these respects, it is not dissimilar to Intelligent Systems' Nintendo Wars series.[CR]The "Expert" subtitle was added to the Super Famicom games in the series. The next (and last) Super Famicom game was titled Daisenryaku Expert WWII: War in Europe, which was released four years later.</plot>

			<title_clean>Dark Half</title_clean>
			<plot>Through the Light came the Darkness, and through the Darkness came the Light. They were inseparable in the beginning, and gave birth to each other. Rukyu appeared before all the other creatures, the great demon of darkness, later to be known as the Satan. The divine hero-god Roda went up to his dark realm to defeat him, but was struck down, and presumed dead. But the hero couldn't die so easily: he swore to defeat Rukyu once and for all. Meanwhile, Rukyu doesn't just stay in his realm, waiting for Roda: he goes out to the world as a death-bringing sorcerer, and he is out for Roda...[CR]The game is quite different from most other RPGs, because it lets you play as both the "good" hero and the villain. The game is divided into chapters, and each chapter is played by either Roda or Rukyu. You switch the two heroes chapter-after-chapter, and lead them to their ultimate battle from two opposite sides. The entire game, including the battles, is viewed from an isometric perspective. The battles are random and turn-based, and the battle field is divided into squares you can position and move your characters on. Both Roda and Rukyu can have party members join them, and both attack mostly with magic. Rukyu uses a special energy called "Soul Power", while Roda cast one-time spells from scrolls he receives after battles.</plot>

			<plot>Dark Kingdom lets you experience a traditional story of a Japanese RPG from "the other side". In this game, you play the role of a mercenary named Gene Dorman. Instead of becoming a world-saving paladin, Gene joins forces with the Demon King himself! He offers his services to him and receives from him various assignments. Gene doesn't yet know that fate will make his path cross with that of the "good" hero Lux, with whom he shares a mysterious connection...[CR]Gene must complete the missions of the Demon King in a specified order, and each time he completes a mission, his rank raises, allowing him access to higher levels of the hierarchy of the Demon King Castle, new abilities, etc. Other servants of the Demon King join him on his mission, and fight together with him as a party. The battles are turn-based and are viewed from first-person perspective. The game has an internal clock with day and night cycle.</plot>

			<title_clean>Dark Law - Meaning of Death</title_clean>
			<plot>Dark Law is the sequel to Dark Lord, the third part in a trilogy of tangentially-related games (think Soul Blazer/Illusion of Gaia/Terranigma.) Whereas the second game in the series, Wizap!, kind of stinks, Dark Law is fully of all kinds of awesome. Combat plays similarly to Treasure Hunter G, if you?ve played that, except it?s not grid based - you have a power bar that decreases as you move, and the more it has left in it the more attacks you can make in a single turn. It?s also got multiple endings![CR]Dark Law is essentially the Japanese interpretation of the pencil-and-paper RPG into a videogame format. The focus is rather heavy on exploration and light on combat, with copious amounts of storytelling thrown in for good measure. It, like Dark Lord before it, is told through a series of short stories ("Scenarios") which tie together by the final conclusion. It's a pretty cool game, on the whole.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]Gideon Zhi picked this up from Haeleth and completed it. There's a lot of low level hacking that went into this and it shows. So check it out.[CR]Also, the game's font is hi-res, which is why the screenshots up top are blurry.[CR]Reviewer: Gideon Zhi [CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/307/</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dear Boys is a 1994 Super Famicom basketball game based on the manga of the same name. The game features both a story mode, which follows the plot of the manga, and an exhibition mode that allows the player to go straight into a match.[CR]The game features a "dramatic" perspective that is also slightly turn-based, similar to the Captain Tsubasa games. A window demonstrates what is happening - a ball is passed, a shot is thrown, the tip-off - in dramatic comic book style that is reminiscent of the manga. While a player's athlete has the ball, the player can pull up a menu that allows them to choose to pass, shoot or look at the present characters stats - each character has their own strengths and weaknesses that the player should keep in mind.[CR]Dear Boys would eventually be followed by a Konami PS2 game based on the same property named Dear Boys: Fast Break!, which was released in 2003. The manga has no exposure outside of Japan, and so neither game would see an international release.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Mizuho womens team (Exhibition mode)[CR]At the team selection screen... press A while holding Select and X. The jersey will change to white-pink, meaning that the Mizuho women's team was chosen.</plot>

			<plot>A young boy named Milon sets off to save Alis, his fairy friend, after she was captured by the evil sorcerer Amon. He later learns that the only way to defeat Amon is by collecting five legendary instruments which Amon has stolen.  The sorcerer placed a curse on these instruments so that their true powers cannot be used and then left them in the hands of his minions.  The only way to lift the curse is by collecting five stars.[CR]Armed with only his bubble shooter, Milon must retrieve the legendary instruments, lift their curses and use their powers to defeat Amon and rescue Alis.[CR]Traveling through many different worlds starting with the forest, Milon will be confronted by many enemies. Milon can either shoot bubbles to trap and send his enemies away, or he can jump and flatten his enemies temporarily turning them into a platform for him to walk across.  [CR]Milon has three different "outfits": red, blue, and green.  With the green outfit, Milon can withstand three hits.  Each time he gets hit, he will be downgraded a color - green to blue, blue to red.  If he gets hit with the red outfit, he will die and have to start the level over.[CR]By collecting 100 music notes, Milon will get an extra life.  There are also other useful items to get like bubble gum that will save Milon once if he were to fall, a special bubble shooter that let's him shoot multiple bubbles at once and a star that makes Milon temporarily invincible so that he can defeat enemies simply by running at them.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Codes[CR]Enter in the password menu:</plot>

Like Capcom's Mega Man Soccer, the game uses a horizontal perspective of the pitch and gives players certain special abilities they can use while playing, though they're limited by a recharging power bar.[CR]The player can select between a Tour Mode, which also features story cutscenes and boss fights, or the standard Vs. Mode. They have a choice of four teams: The Red Hot Doluckies (cats), the Pochi Funky Dogs (dogs), the Devid Rabbit Rockers (rabbits) and the Goro Wild Bears (bears).[CR]The game was exclusive to Japan and the Super Famicom.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]01Title Screen00:1302Storyline02:4403Team Profile01:2404Main Menu01:0305Theme of Red Hot Doluckys02:0806Theme of Pochi Funky Dogs02:4607Theme of Debid Rabbit Rockers03:5308Theme of Goro Wild Bears02:4809Goal!00:0410Goal Celebration ~ Red Hot Doluckys00:0711Goal Celebration ~ Pochi Funky Dogs00:0812Goal Celebration ~ Debid Rabbit Rockers00:0813Goal Celebration ~ Goro Wild Bears00:0714Own Goal ~ Red Hot Doluckys00:0315Own Goal ~ Pochi Funky Dogs00:0416Own Goal ~ Debid Rabbit Rockers00:0417Own Goal ~ Goro Wild Bears00:0418Half Time Status02:3619Half Time Show01:2520P.K.00:1321P.K. ~ Goalie Blocks!00:0222P.K. ~ Goal!00:0323End of Game00:0424Next Tour Mode Game00:0725A New Rival Has Arrived!00:0226Stop Dr. Yamada's Evil Scheme!02:2027Defeated Dr. Yamada!00:0428Theme of Jet Mole Dangerous03:1729Goal Celebration ~ Jet Mole Dangerous00:0830Own Goal ~ Jet Mole Dangerous00:0431Ending03:47[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Bonus Mode[CR]Wait for the logo to start to appear.

Each team has its own strengths and weaknesses and special abilities (I.E., special bats, special pitches, etc.). It is otherwise a typical baseball game. Sometimes weather will affect the game (i.e., a storm); other bizarre random events are also possible. At the 7th inning stretch, everyone stops for a nice can of their Coke product of choice.Dolucky the Cat[CR]The title character, "Neco Dolucky" (his full name) is a cool cat from New York City. He enjoys soul music and dancing, and loves nothing more than a cool, refreshing Coca Cola Classic. One day he and his other animal friends were bored, so they decided to start a baseball league. One can assume their sponsor is the Coca Cola Corporation... Suddenly, they receive a challenge via telegram from the "Tab Clear Empire Hellthunder Destroyers!" Of course they can't back down, that wouldn't be TOUGH. Fight on through baseball, boys![CR]TEAMS[CR]These are the playable teams in the game. The final opponents in the story mode, a team of fleas called the "Tab Clear Hellthunder Destroyers", are not playable.The Coca Cola Doluckies.[CR]The Coca Cola Doluckies: A team consisting entirely of cats, lead by Dolucky. They are a balanced team, skilled equally in all stats.The Poochies.[CR]The Fanta Fire Poochies: A team consisting entirely of dogs, they are also a well-balanced team. Obviously their drink of choice is Fanta. They are the chief rivals of the Doluckies.The Gorous.[CR]The Georgia Gorou Yakyuu Kai: The Georgia "Gorou Baseball Association". Composed entirely of bears, they are named after Georgia Select, Coke's Japanese coffee label. They are the strongest team in terms of strength and stamina, but are very slow and otherwise unremarkable.The Devitrollers.[CR]The Vegita Beta Devitrollers: A team of rabbits named after Vegita Beta, Coke's Japanese vegetable-vitamin drink. They have a very high speed, speed but are quite weak in hitting power.The Wakamoto family.[CR]The Coke Light Ninja Wakamoto Ikka: The "Ninja Wakamoto Family" (&#24525;&#32773;&#33509;&#26412;&#19968;&#23478;), a team composed of ninja chickens. They also have very high speed, but slightly superior hitting power compared to the Devitrollers. They have less stamina, though.The Longnoses.[CR]The Sprite Paozouto Longnoses: A powerful team of elephants. Their stats are in general quite high, but they're pretty slow. They represent the popular lemon and lime drink Sprite.The Gumbos.[CR]The Hi-C Gumbos: Another powerful team composed of gorillas. Once again, their largest weakness is their relative lack of foot speed.The Otokichis.[CR]The Aquarius Otokichi-kun tachi: A team of idiot seals all named Otokichi. They don't really excel at anything, but are faster than average. Their drink of choice is obviously Aquarius, a Japanese sports drink from Coke.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Crocodile as commentator[CR]Just insert the following as password.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Crocodile as commentator[CR]Insert the following as password.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Crocodile as commentator[CR]Insert the following as password (four spaces before and after that word).

If five blocks of the same color are touching, they vanish. Certain blocks, gray in color, cannot be removed unless they're touching five colored blocks as they vanish: the goal is to quickly fire five blocks to remove these before they reach the player character at the bottom of the screen. There are also random power-ups that can be acquired. The blocks have facial expressions that change depending on the number of similar blocks they're touching, allowing the player to see how close they are to clearing them if the top of the screen cuts it off.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Doraemon: Nobita to Yousei no Kuni (roughly "Doraemon: Nobita and the Land of Fairies") is an adventure game with action sequences for the Super Famicom. It's the first of four Super Famicom Doraemon games, featuring the titular robotic cat who depends on various gadgets to fight enemies and rescue his young human friends.[CR]Doraemon must find his friends across town with the help of a friendly fairy, and this involves exploring a large town until he finds a gateway to an action level (usually a trigger event must happen, at which point Doraemon can travel to a blinking part of his mini-map). In these action levels, Doraemon jumps and fights his way through platformer stages.[CR]											</plot>

In these action stages, Doraemon must reach the end of the stage and occasionally fight a boss. He has an array of weapons which fire in different directions, with certain set-ups useful for specific encounters.[CR]Doraemon 2 was followed by another Super Famicom sequel: Doraemon 3: Nobita to Toki no Hougyoku.</plot>

The player can switch between Doraemon, Nobita, and eventually their other friends, each of which has their own special abilities as well as various strengths and weaknesses in terms of jump height and speed. The plot takes them through history via Doraemon's time machine, starting with the prehistoric era and moving forward through time.[CR]Doraemon 3 was published by Epoch, like the first two, but the developer changed from SAS Sakata to an uncredited company. The graphics and gameplay are a little different from its two predecessors as a result. AIM (which later became Fortyfive) was discovered to have contributed to the sound design. [CR]	</plot>

			<title_clean>Doraemon 4 - Nobita to Tsuki no Oukoku</title_clean>
			<plot>The game is based on the popular manga series Doraemon. Doraemon is a blue cat robot who came from the future to protect a Japanese boy named Nobita. Nobita always gets himself in all kinds of troubles, so his grandson in the future decided to help him by sending Doraemon to keep an eye on him. One day, Nobita and Doraemon are looking at the beautiful moon, when suddenly a strange light engulfs them. They learn that something terrible has happened in the Moon Kingdom. Now they must travel to the moon and discover what is going on.[CR]This is a platform action game that is somewhat similar to  Super Mario World. You travel on a world map and enter various platform locations. Before each level, you can choose to play as either Doraemon, Nobita, or other four available characters. You can jump on enemies' heads or shoot at them with various weapons to eliminate them. There are many items and upgrades scattered around the levels, and sometimes it is possible to power-up by using two characters simultaneously.</plot>

			<title_clean>Dossun! Ganseki Battle</title_clean>
			<plot>A falling block puzzle game  in a pseudo-medieval fantasy setting that pits two characters against each other in an abstract form of combat that is quite similar to games like Columns. Combining at least three matching symbols in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal line does not only clear them off the screen, but also deals damage to an opponent. This means that players do not only have to keep their game area clear, but also pay attention to their characters health bar. Once a block touches the top of the screen or the health bar is diminished the game ends.[CR]There are four different icons that have different effects when combined:[CR]Books, swords and rocks deal damage to an opponent by attacking with fireballs, dragons or swords.[CR]Bottles heal a certain amount of health.[CR]Purple blocks have no effect, but clog up the screen nonetheless.[CR]Chain reactions result in particularly powerful attacks or place one or more grey blocks inside the opponents area. They can be destroyed just like ordinary blocks, but they always stay in the same spot and do not fall down.[CR]More complex chain reactions give access to special attacks, up to three of which can be held and activated with the shoulder buttons. Special attacks have different effects that include clearing all purple blocks, using all potions and clearing the bottom three lines.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Down the World: Mervil's Ambition is a Super Famicom strategy RPG developed and published by ASCII Corporation in 1994. The game features the eponymous Mervil, who survives an attack that wipes out his unit only to find himself travelling through time to escape. The game follows Mervil and his fairy companion as they follow quests and grow stronger. Battles are depicted on isometric grids and require some strategy behind them.[CR]Susumu Matsushita is credited as the creative force behind the art direction and character design. He had worked on the Super Famicom RPG Elfaria prior to Down the World, and designed the cover art for many other games. Down the World is also distinctive for having female vocals on its theme music: a rarity for non-CD 16-bit games.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dr. Mario is a puzzle game developed by Nintendo R&amp;D1 and published by Nintendo. The game was originally released on the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy in 1990. It has since seen many sequels and remakes, such as Dr. Mario &amp; Puzzle League on the Game Boy Advance and Dr. Mario Online RX on WiiWare. The soundtrack was composed by Hirokazu "Hip" Tanaka.[CR]According to the instruction booklet, Mario is now working as a doctor in the virus research lab at the Mushroom Kingdom Hospital. As usual, Dr. Mario is about to begin his research when Nurse Toadstool informs him that several viruses are out of control and spreading quickly. Mario exclaims "Oh No! We've got to do something! I have just developed a new vitamin that should be able to take care of it. I sure hope this stuff works!"[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in Dr. Mario[CR]Dr. Mario is a puzzle game that uses much the same falling block mechanic made ubiquitous by Tetris. Vitamin capsules are dropped into the play field and must be rotated to remove viruses hovering at fixed spots (each half the size of a vitamin.) The vitamins are colored one of three colors on each side (red, yellow, or blue,) and the colors of the vitamin must be matched with the corresponding viruses of the same colors. After stacking up four of the same color, the virus is eliminated. After destroying all viruses on the playing field, the player progresses to the next level.[CR]The player can select 21 different levels (0 to 20), and players who can clear level 20 can make it all the way to level 24 (clearing 24 just repeats this level continuously). Each level has a different amount of viruses, and in level 20 there are 84. No more than 84 can fit, making each level after 20 have 84 viruses as well. The player can also select the background music, either Fever or Chill. The game speed can also be set to low, medium, or high.  The more time spent clearing a particular level, the faster the game speed will gradually become. [CR]					</plot>

			<title_clean>Dragon Ball Z - Hyper Dimension</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dragon Ball Z: Hyper Dimension is a 2D fighting game developed by TOSE and published by Bandai for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (in Japan only) on March 29, 1996. The last Dragon Ball Z game to be released for the console, Dragon Ball Z: Hyper Dimension featured a darker, less cartoonish art style and traditional fighting game mechanics (with the ability to knock opponents into different areas of the stage).[CR]The game features ten playable characters from various points in the franchise (from the Frieza Saga onward). The game's story mode loosely retells key battles from the series.[CR]Like some previous installments of the franchise for the SNES, Dragon Ball Z: Hyper Dimension was released in both France and Spain. Released on December 1996, the game's Story Mode was completely disabled due to the lack of translation.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]What made this addition different to previous Dragon Ball Z fighters was the inclusion of the 'desperate move'. Each character has a desperate move which could be used when their life bar was low (i.e when it is flashing). For example, in Goku's desperate move, he would power up, perform his teleportation technique (Shunkan-Id&#244;s), does a combo, transforms into Super Saiyan 3 and performs his Super Dragonfist move (Ry&#363;-ken). Now the opponent helpless in the air, would be finished with a Spirit Bomb (Genki-Dama).[CR]The majority of the stages that would be fought in are multi-tier requiring a specific combo to be executed to knock your opponent into another screen.[CR]Characters were also able to perform background attacks and replenish their health.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]The game featured 10 playable characters (each from various points in the Dragon Ball Z universe):Goku (Super Saiyan, can transform into Super Saiyan 3 in his "desperation attack")Vegeta (Super Saiyan, possessed by the evil wizard Babidi)Gotenks (Super Saiyan 3)Gohan (full potential unlocked)Vegito (Super Saiyan)PiccoloMajin BuuKid BuuFrieza (final form)Cell (perfect form)[CR]						</plot>

			<plot>Dragon Ball Z: Super Butouden was the first fighting game based on the Dragon Ball Z franchise and the first to introduce the split-screen mode to the games, where the screen is split in two whenever one of the two combatants moves away too far to keep them both shown in a single screen. This title features the adventures of Goku from the battle against Piccolo in the martial arts tournament to the conclusion of the Cell Games.[CR]The initially available characters are Goku (without SSJ), Vegeta (without SSJ), C-20, C-16, Piccolo, Freezer, C-18 and Original Cell. But upon entering the right code you can expand the list with Future Trunks (SSJ), Gohan (SSJ), Perfect Cell, Goku (SSJ), and Vegeta (SSJ), all of them relegated to occasionally appear in the Story Mode either as rivals or as alternative selectable characters.[CR]In the story mode, players select which fighter to pit against each opponent as while advancing rounds leading up to the battle against Perfect Cell. Players can also go one-on-one against another player or a CPU opponent. There is also a martial arts tournament mode, to play against eight players or CPU opponents in a elimination tournament.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Extra Characters[CR]At the intro screen, when you hear Goku talking, hold the L and R button and rotate the D-pad and and the four buttons [A, B, X, Y] in a circular manner. Repeat this until you hear a chime and Goku's voic again. [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Extra Characters[CR]While playing on VS Battle mode, pause the game and press A + B + X + Y simultaneously to have a CPU control either player.</plot>

			<plot>Dragon Ball Z: Super Butouden 2 is a fighting game that chronicles the events that take place during the battle against Perfect Cell, and includes a side story about Bojack and his henchmen (who Gohan, Trunks, Piccolo and Vegita fought in the "Bojack Unbound" movie), and Broli, the Legendary Super Saiyan. You can play as SSJ2 Gohan, Piccolo, Vegeta, Future Trunks, Perfect Cell, Cell Jr., Bojack or Zangya. Goku and Broli will be also available after you enter a secret code.[CR]Some basic elements from Super Butouden have remained, such as the split screen system or the special attacks (which now are executed by a shorter button combination). However, now you will also count with the Meteo combos, which allow attacks with multiple hits. You can also hold down buttons in order to quickly recharge your energy. Special moves can be also fired back in retaliation to your rival's attack, marking then the beginning of a button smashing duel.[CR]There are 3 game modes, including a story mode that lets you choose different paths and changes depending on the outcome of battles; a 1 vs 1 mode, where you can battle against another player or the CPU; and a martial arts tournament mode with an eliminatory system in which you and other players (or the CPU) choose a character to become the winner.</plot>

			<plot>Dragon Ball Z: Super Butouden 3 (known as Dragon Ball Z: Ultime Menace in France) is the last installment to the Super Butoden series for the SNES, which in this occasion is based on the Majin Buu saga. Avaliable charachers are Goku, Goten, Kid Trunks, Majin Vegita, Junior Gohan, Kaiohshin, Majin Boo, Darbura and C-18, plus another one available as a secret character: Future Trunks.[CR]Split screen mode is maintained, but now you can now fly up or down while on the same screen as your opponent. You can also struggle with your rival pushing with your arms together to test your button smashing abilities, or execute new Meteor Combos. Scenarios will also be different (mainly based on Buu saga) and will include alternative versions of themselves with different times of the day as well.[CR]The game allows you to take part either in a 8 player martial arts tournament with an eliminatory system or to make single combats against the CPU or another player. This makes Super Butouden 3 the only game of the series without a Story Mode,. It can be explained by the fact that when the game was released the Buu saga was still on a very early stage in Japanese TV.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Codes[CR]Before a fight, while the characters talk to each other, enter these codes to power-up your character and strengthen your attacks. If done correctly, your character should charge up.</plot>

			<plot>This is a direct sequel to the  first "interactive fighter" for SNES, based on the popular manga/anim series Dragon Ball. The game picks up the story where it ended in the previous game, and continues through Piccolo, Saiyajin, and Freezer sagas of the manga. After the battle with the Demon King (Daimaou) Piccolo, the twenty-third World Martial Arts Tournament is about to begin. But to the amazement of the hero Son Goku and his friends, their archrival Piccolo appears during the tournament, so that it quickly turns into a genuine battle.[CR]You control Son Goku and his son Son Gohan, switching between them as the game progresses. The game is basically an interactive comic book in which you can influence the story by choosing to press a button when the game prompts you to make a choice. You'll also participate in battles. The battle system is similar to rock-paper-scissors game, where one kind of move always beats or always loses to another. You can dash into your enemies, attack physically, and perform special moves, pressing the buttons in real time (although the battles are divided into turns).</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]This game covers the Dragon Ball Z sagas (or seasons) running from the beginning of the series up through the journey to the planet Namek and the battle with Freiza. The game features nearly all the warriors from the anime, mostly in the battles they were involved in within the series.[CR]The game uses a somewhat unique (at least for the time) turn-based card battle system wherein one uses cards with different offensive and defensive values to execute different moves, including several special moves unique to each character. The status of the cards are indicated by the Dragon Balls on the corners of it, the more stars on each, the higher the offensive or defensive values. Rather than have the usual RPG stats of ATK, DEF, INT, etc., the characters have actual power levels or Battle Power (denonced as BP in the game) that increases as they level up. As fans of the series are aware, power levels are the backbone of fights.[CR]The game features random encounters, somewhat anachronistically fought against varying colors of saibamen even at the very beginning of the game before they were introduced in the series. The game is unique, not only because it's a Dragon Ball Z RPG, but because there are "optional" secret parts to the game which will power up the player if they follow the plot of the anime.Playable CharactersGokuPiccoloKrillinYamchaTienChiaotzuVegeta (on Namek)Nail (for a short time on Namek)Dende (does not fight, however if he reaches Level 3 he can restore 1 character's HP and KI each turn)Enemy CharactersRaditzBubbles the ApeKing KaiNappaVegeta w/ScouterDodoriaZarbonGuldoRecoomeBurterJeiceCapt. GinyuFriezaVarious colors of SaibamenVarious Freiza goonsSecrets[CR]Power up Piccolo - After Piccolo is brought back on Namek, go and find Nail. He will be lying on the ground after getting decimated by Frieza. Fuse with him and Piccolo will be at level 48 which is the level cap, although his power level can be temporarily boosted mid-battle by using a King Kai Card or a Guru Card. After fighting beating Freiza's 2nd form he will run away, during this time the player can find the two Namek Warriors that helped them earlier in the game (under the assumption that the player didn't get them killed) and they will be given a choice whether to allow them to fuse with Piccolo. If the player chooses yes, Piccolo gains another large boost in his Battle Power, however this means losing Dende and his healing ability. Choosing "no" allows the player to keep Dende.[CR]Unlock the Super Saiyan form and battle Vegeta as a Super Saiyan - In the final battle against Freiza, allow him to kill either Krillin or Chiaou-Tzu then he'll become enraged and transform into the infamous blonde-haired warrior, giving him a massive power level boost and allowing him pretty much dominate Frieza. After Goku flies away, he will be confronted and challenged by Vegeta and Goku will transform into a Super Saiyan and fight him.[CR]Easy Levels for Saiyans - Goku, Gohan, and Vegeta can level up mid-battle if they use an item that completely restores their health while their HP is 5 or lower. The player will see a short cutscene of the character powering up and it will say something along the lines of "Gains a Level". It's a nice touch since according to the anime Saiyans grow stronger after recovering from mortal wounds or near death. Take advantage of this in the beginning with Goku. Grind and gain a few more levels with this method before fighting Raditz. It will make the game a lot easier once Goku arrives on Namek. When using this method with Gohan and Vegeta, take full advantage. Same as with Goku, grind, heal, level. Repeat. It will be a lot more satisfying to just finish random battles just by using only one character from the party once strong enough. Not to mention the rest of the party levels up every 1 or 2 battles so that's always good.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Saiyan Level-Up[CR]When Goku, Vegeta, or Gohan reaches a health level below 5, use a card like Korin, Kami, or Shenron, that fully heals a character, on them, and they will grow one level. This can be recognized in the show when Vegeta tells Krillin to hurt him badly and then let Dende heal him so he can become stronger.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Saiyan Level-Up[CR]When you are fighting Freeza in his fourth and final form, let a weak character like Kuririn or Chao-Zu. My preferred choice will be Chao-Zu. Do not let Son Goku, Vegita, Gohan and Piccolo die. [CR]After defeating Freeza in his final scene, the usual credits, showing Goku flying will be seen until Vegita appears. Vegita will then transform to Super Saiyjin Vegita and so will Goku transform to Super Saiyajin Goku. Thus, the ultimate battle among the super saiyajin begins. [CR]Super Saiyajin Vegita is by far the toughest boss in the entire game, even stronger than the final form of Freeza. Once you defeat Super Saiyjin Vegita, you get a new ending that is different from the normal.</plot>

			<title_clean>Dragon Quest I &amp; II</title_clean>
			<plot>This is a remake of two classic NES RPGs - an exclusively Japanese release of the two first Dragon Quest titles on one cartridge.[CR]In Dragon Quest (known as Dragon Warrior in the US), you play as the descendant of the legendary warrior Erdrick, and your goal is to recover the magical Ball of Light from Erdrick's and the humanity's arch-enemy, the Dragon Lord. In Dragon Quest II, you assume the role of the descendant of the hero of the first game, and must join forces with two other characters in order to defeat a demon lord who destroyed a nearby city and killed its inhabitants.

After that, go to the Dragon's Horn North Tower, and get the Dew's Yarn on the 3rd floor.   Take these items and see Don Mahone.  After you give him the items for him to make the first Water Flying Cloth, *WITHOUT SAVING*, go back to the Dragon's Horn North Tower on the 3rd floor, and search for the Dew's Yarn.  It *WILL* be there.  After you get the Dew's Yarn the second time, *SAVE*.  After saving, turn the game off (make sure you hold in reset so you don't erase the files) and turn it back on.  Go back to Don Mahone and get your first Water Flying Cloth.  Now go back to Zahan and get the Magic Loom again.  Take the items to Don Mahone once again, and save.  Turn off the power, then turn it back on, then go back to Don Mahone, and get your second Water Flying Cloth. [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR](If you saved after giving Don Mahone the Dew's Yarn and Magic Loom, but DIDN'T go back to get the Dew's Yarn again, it will no longer be there.  The Magic Loom however, you can get again at any time.)[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]There's a place in the game where you can defeat a clown and win a Staff of Thunder, which sells for 19,500 gold.

When you come back, the clown will be there again, and you can get another Staff of Thunder.[CR]Continue doing this to get as much gold as you want.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]Normally, when equipped with a cursed item (Sword of Destruction, Gremlin's Armor, or Gremlin's Tail), there is a 50% chance the person wearing the item will freeze in battle, rather than act. This is unfortunate, as the sword and armour are the most powerful in the game.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]However, there is a way to gain the benefits of the items without the curse.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]1. Equip the item(s). This will give you the increased attack and/or defense of the cursed item(s) and inflict your character with the curse.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]2. Go to the House of Healing and pay to have the character equipping the item uncursed. This will cost 100 GP per experience level. This will remove the item(s) from your item list and remove the curse, but does NOT cause your attack or defense stat to recalculate.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]3. Never again look at your equip screen for that character or gain an experience level. The game does not recalculate the character's attack or defense stats until you look at the equip screen or gain a level, so you do not lose the hefty attack or defense bonus granted by equipping the cursed item(s).[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]You are free to look in and use other menus, including item and status, or even save and reset, without losing the bonus. However, since leveling up recalculates your attack and defense, you may want to wait until you are ready to defeat the final boss to use this glitch, since it cannot be repeated without finding a new copy of the cursed item.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]In the cave to Rhone, on level 5, fall down a hole (any hole).  Go to the lower left corner of level 4. Go one square up and one square right.  You'll fall down a hole, and the sword will be right there.  Best Sword in the game.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dragon Slayer: Eiyuu Densetsu II is the second game in the Dragon Slayer spin-off series The Legend of Heroes. It continues several years after where Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes left off with the son of the hero and heroine from the first game investigating an incident in the nearby mountains involving people in strange spacesuits. The game plays similarly to the first, with traditional turn-based battles and additional party members that can be recruited as the game progresses.[CR]Dragon Slayer: Eiyuu Densetsu II ("Eiyuu Densetsu" translates directly as Legend of Heroes) was originally released on the NEC PC-8801 and ported to the PC-9801, FM Towns, PC Engine, Super Famicom, Sega Mega Drive and MS-DOS. The Super Famicom version was published by Epoch and was compatible with the Barcode Battler system through an adapter peripheral that was sold separately. Several codes could be transferred via the device to unlock features in the game.[CR]Eiyuu Densetsu II marks the first true sequel from a game in the Dragon Slayer franchise, Nihon Falcom's RPG anthology series that changes settings and entire mechanics from game to game. The Legend of Heroes series would continue to receive many more sequels, including the Gagharv trilogy (The Legend of Heroes III, IV and V) and the Trails in the Sky trilogy (The Legend of Heroes VI, split into three separate games or "chapters"). [CR]Though The Legend of Heroes II: Prophecy of the Moonlight Witch was labelled as the second game in the series for its US title, it was simply renamed as such to avoid sequel confusion, like how Final Fantasy IV was renamed II for its US release due to several games being skipped. Dragon Slayer: Eiyuu Densetsu II has yet to receive an official English localization, unlike its predecessor and five immediate successors.[CR]			</plot>

			<plot>From deep within Mordroc's Castle, a foul stench rose up to mix with the cold, damp midnight air; the telltale sign of the evil wizard's pet fire-breathing dragon, Singe; the beast that guarded the Princess Daphne in the deadly caves far below the surface. Dirk the Daring walked steadily toward the castle gate. He felt no fear; but then fear was for cowards. No other would dare to enter this perilous castle where Mordroc had imprisoned the helpless princess. But for Dirk there was no other possible course to take. Now was the time for heroes. Now was the time for action. Now was the time to enter the Dragon's Lair...</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dual Orb II is a turn-based RPG from I'Max and the sequel to their 1993 SFC game Dual Orb. The plot concerns an evil and technologically advanced Empire currently spreading across the world, and the hero Aleth and his adoptive brother Crown Prince Lagnus. Aleth and Lagnus tag along with the mysterious bard Cassius for an adventure, but after accidentally breaking a seal at an ancient temple events start to go downhill fast. [CR]The game uses a slanted perspective in its turn-based combat similar to Breath of Fire, except opponents are on the top-right and the player characters are on the bottom-left. It also uses Mode 7 for its world map traversal. The game was never officially translated into English, like its predecessor, but it did receive a fan translation.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Two scientists have successfully lead the world into advanced science and technology. Their hunger for knowledge lead them to discover an orb containing infinite power. One scientist became consumed by greed and wanted to take over the world with the orb's power. The other scientist defeated him and the world was left in ruin, but humanity survived and continued to thrive. Years later, an empire manages to revive the evil scientist. Now that he has returned, the fate of humanity is left in the hands of a child born from the heavens.[CR]Playable characters[CR]Aleth, unofficially a Paladin, who was found by the height priest of Garade during a journey to the castle. He was given the honor of being the next high priest when Lagnus is King of Garade. He and Lagnus grew up together and became best friends. He is raised by the current high priest of Garade and has the ability to use holy magic.Lagnus, prince of Garade. An excellent spearman that desires for more power to defend his kingdom.Cassius, a bard who's true secrets are revealed later in the game.Serra, a Goddess that only possesses typical human magic powers and a rifle.Saladin, a thief. A typical swordsman who eventually learns magic.Najiri, a beast boy who only has one attack: a nail slash.Karina, princess who has power over men, Saladin in particular. She has no magic abilities, but uses a Stab attack.Bargan, captain of a pirate ship who helps players invade an enemy pirate hideout.[CR][B]Music:[/B][CR]Music for Dual Orb II was composed by Nobuyuki Hara and Yu Yoshida.[CR][B]References:[/B][CR]http://www.fantasyanime.com/legacy2/dualorb2_about.htm[CR]							</plot>

When every casino on the map has been conquered the last casino, which belongs to a dragon, opens up and the player must beat the serpentine dictator of Nevada at his own (casino) game.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dynamic Stadium is a baseball game from Eleca/Electronics Application released exclusively for the Super Famicom. While adopting the same behind-the-batter perspective as Namco's Famista series, Dynamic Stadium presents its athletes as comic book heroes rather than chibi figures, making them absurdly buff and frequently featuring action shots of them catching fly-balls and narrowly making it to base before being caught out. "Safe!" and "Out!" calls are presented as spiky word balloons.[CR]Dynamic Stadium does not feature an official NPB license, so all the team names are fictitious. The game was published in Japan by Sammy Corporation and was never localized for overseas territories.</plot>

			<title_clean>Earth Light</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Earth Light is a strategy game for the Super Famicom that features mechs fighting each other in various conflicts on land, in air and in space. Though superficially similar to existing Gundam strategy games, Earth Light is unaffiliated with that franchise (coincidentally enough, a later 1999/2000 Gundam movie had the subtitle "Earth Light"). As with earlier strategy games from Hudson, like Military Madness, the action takes place on a hexagonal grid, with entire sides taking turns moving into position and engaging enemy units within range. The game also takes a leaf from Advance Wars's book by painting the sides in vibrant colors to help make them stand out from one another.[CR]Earth Light was eventually followed up with a sequel, Earth Light II: Luna Strike.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Debug Mode[CR]During the intro, hold [B]Down+B[/B] and press [B]R[/B] three times.

			<plot>The graphics are eye-popping, breath-taking, stunning and unbelievable, not to mention incredible. This is no hack-and-slash, rip-your-guts-out fighter! This is the future of RPGs, right here in your hands! With music this good, you won't turn the sound off--you'll turn it up!No more small elves leading your team! This game contains real, believable figures. You won't be embarrassed to use your own name; you'll be proud. It's just you against six other characters in search of the 7 Sacred Runes. Whoever finds them... Rules the World. It's that simple, that easy. The only problem is you have some enemies, and I don't mean a few. I mean an army of things you've never seen before ready to raise the hair on the back of your neck and take you out the one swing. This is one powerful RPG. Can you handle it?![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Infinite Stat Boosts (Lux)[CR]In the past, with Lux in the party, he is able to get stat boosts for 30 HP, 30 MP, and 20 of the remaining stats. While this cutscene occurs, you can walk four steps. During those steps, if you walk out of bounds (like through a doorway) as the dialogue box appears, you will get the named stat boost. Here in particular, you want to walk right to the wall, let go of Right briefly, and then press it again quickly. By doing this, you can still get another stat boost, with the previous one having already taken effect![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Defeat Romus in 1 turn.[CR]First let Romus kill you, then back in Rablesk and find a man with an upset wife.

			<plot>In "Emerald Dragon", you play as Atrushan, a blue dragon who lives in the Dragon World. One day, he and his friends discover a ship wreck near a mountain. After examining the wreck, the dragons find a human child - a little girl. The wise White Dragon, the leader of the dragons, tells them that her name is Tamryn and that she will play an important role in their lives. The girl doesn't remember anything, and grows up together with the dragons. But when she turns fifteen, she decides to go back to her homeland - the Human World. Soon after Tamryn has left, Atrushan realizes he can't bear the separation, and asks the White Dragon to allow him to go and find Tamryn in the Human World. But a mysterious evil curse has been placed on the dragons - they can't appear among the humans in their true form. Atrushan agrees to become a human and goes to the Human World - to find Tamryn, and also a way to remove the curse...[CR]The game features traditional Japanese-style RPG gameplay - Atrushan and his party travel over world map, visiting towns and descending into dungeons. The battle system is somewhat unusual - you can control only Atrushan, while other party members are controlled by the AI. You have a special bar for your actions in battle: once it is depleted, you can't perform any action and must wait for your next turn. You can move freely over the battle field, position yourself strategically near or far away from the enemy, attack from different sides, and assign general strategies to your non-controllable party members.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Debug Menu[CR]At any in game screen other than combat or status, enter the code below.[CR]You can Level Up, increase money, turn off encounters and use 2 extra save slots[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Ending Omake[CR]Beat all 5 of the Casinos in the game (including the "empty" one in the City of the Dead), then beat the game and after the credits are over,  wait 10 minutes at the MediaWorks logo to get a secret Omake mode.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Operation Europe: Path to Victory 1939-45, or Europa Sensen ("European Front") as it's known in Japan, is a Koei turn-based war strategy game based on conflicts taking place during World War II.[CR]The game is the WW2 equivalent to Koei's earlier Nobunaga's Ambition and Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. As with those games, emphasis is placed on individual commanders and their abilities, and the game prioritizes tactics and numbers over graphical prowess. The player has a number of different WW2 commanders to choose from while playing either side, some of which are real but most are fictional.[CR]				</plot>

			<title_clean>Eye of the Beholder</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Eye of the Beholder (EotB) is the first game in the  AD&amp;D-based  Eye of the Beholder trilogy published by SSI as a part of their "Legend Series." It was developed by Westwood Associates, the same developers that would go on to become Westwood Studios, and published by SSI. It was notable at the time for its use of lush 3D graphics, extensive puzzles, and animated monster encounters along with the degree of interactivity that players had within its dungeons such as flipping levers, weighing down pressure plates with stones, and its real-time interface. The game pits a party of adventurers against the machinations of a beholder known as Xanathar: a ruthless criminal hiding deep beneath the port city of Waterdeep.[CR]The game is a licensed TSR product, and implements the  2nd Edition AD&amp;D ruleset and features the  Forgotten Realms campaign setting that had been used in previous SSI AD&amp;D games such as the Gold Box series. In the Forgotten Realms setting, Waterdeep is one of the greatest cities of the era, the so-called "Crown of the North," a vital trading hub whose wealth has seen its environs and its influence expand rapidly throughout the Sword Coast region. The secretive Lords of Waterdeep, the unseen council that both watches and protects the city from fell schemes discovered outside and within its own walls, maintain the tenuous balance of power between the factions there in order to ensure its survival. Only one of these Lords is ever shown as the "public" face in order to act as a liaison between the people and themselves.[CR]Copy protection takes the form of challenge questions that the player will occasionally be asked during the course of the game that would refer to a specific word within the game manual. Copies were encouraged in order to preserve the original disks. The console versions did not include this aspect.[CR]The manual is also notable for including a great deal of information concerning the monsters, classes, and weapons that could be encountered within the game, all adhering to the 2nd Edition AD&amp;D ruleset. Experience tables and other pieces of information are located in the back of the manual. The following manuals would be similar in design, although the monsters described would be changed from one title to the next. The manual for Eye of the Beholder also contains a rough map of Waterdeep as well as a historical primer on its significance.[CR]The game was ported to consoles in 1994, including a  SNES version by  Capcom and a  Sega CD version by  Sega. While Capcom's version is a more faithful reproduction of the original, the Sega CD version was an enhanced  remake famous for its CD soundtrack composed by  Yuzo Koshiro. Departing from the  chiptune medieval music of the the original PC version, Koshiro's Sega CD soundtrack was one of the first  ambient  electronica soundtracks.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Eye of the Beholder's story begins with a meeting called by Piergeiron, the current Lord of Waterdeep, with the party. He hands them a letter describing a threat that his friend, the Archmage, Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, has detected witin the city and requests that the party investigate the disturbances and, if necessary, deal with them in whatever method they see fit. They are given an official commission from the city and are quickly ushered to the sewers where they believe the threat to be located. However, their unseen nemesis has been waiting for them and the only way out is suddenly blocked by a thundering avalanche of rocks and stone, forcing the player to delve deeper below the streets of Waterdeep and to a confrontation with their foe.[CR]After a series of traps and challenges that the party encounters during the adventure, they come face to face with Xanathar, a beholder who is also acting as the major crime lord of Waterdeep who has been plotting his ascension to power. After a climactic battle in which Xanatar is defeated, the party is celebrated as heroes of the city.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game uses a  grid-based, 3D system wherein the world is viewed from a first-person perspective with 90&#176; turns and movement spaces. Within the ever-present interface, a small window on the upper left quadrant of the screen displayed the world as in the first with the party listed on the right. A text box on the bottom part of the screen displays various messages while a compass is also shown when outside of combat. Random enemy encounters provide combat opportunities within the game against mixed groups of foes. Everything in the interface is mouse-driven.[CR]Party setup and character selection are left entirely up to the player and many of the mechanisms and options available would remain unchanged through the next two iterations of the series. The party would always remain limited to six characters.Races[CR]Six races are available for players to choose from and would be the first step in creating a new batch of characters. Gender has no bearing on a character's performance aside from making available the appropriate portraits during character creation. Many of the steps utilized in this part of the game would continue to act as the standard setup throughout the series.[CR]In keeping with the 2nd Edition AD&amp;D ruleset, each race has its own set of restrictions concerning both what classes are available to them such as how far they can advance in certain ones. Racial modifiers can also affect their efficiency in certain professions. Human: As in most RPGs, their statistics and abilities are fairly average across the board with no distinctive bonuses.Elf: Fair haired, fair skinned, and more agile than humans, their specialties are focused on both magic and war although they tend to do better as spellcasters. They have a bonus to dexterity and the use of bows along with long or short swords. They are highly resistant to charm or sleep spells. Dwarf: Short, gruff, and strong, they are renowned for their smithing skills as well as their combat abilities. Being a somewhat non-magical race, they have good resistances against many spells and even poisons. Halflings: Short in stature, friendly to a fault, and generally good natured, halflings are also innately resistant to spells. They're also dexterous making them decent fighters and sticky fingered rogues.Half Elves: They have no racial modifiers but are somewhat resistant to sleep and charm spells. However, because of their longer lifespans, they are able to multi-class with a greater number of combinations than other races and are decent fighters. Gnome: Good as clerics, thieves, and even fighters, they are also fairly magic resistant as their distant cousins, the dwarves, are.Classes[CR]As with many RPGs, the game offers a choice to the player to select from a variety of classes that they could use to first create their characters and, ultimately, their parties with.[CR]Throughout the entire  Eye of the Beholder series, six  classes would be made available to players to choose from, each with its own set of restrictions, although certain races have the ability to multi-class meaning that they can become a combination of classes. Each classes require certain prime requisites, or ability scores, to be at certain values before that character can become part of that class.Fighter: The consummate fighter, they can use nearly every weapon that they find. They can use magical weapons, rings, but can cast no spells. As they gain levels, they also gain speed which enables them to attack more often in combat. The prime requisite for this class is strength and any race and alignment can be a member.Paladin: These are elite fighters dedicated to smiting evil wherever it may be and will not join a party that has evil members. They are immune to disease, have increased resistances to spell effects and poison, and can heal other characters with their "laying on of hands" ability. At higher levels, they are also able to turn undead and can cast certain clerical spells. They also have a persistent aura around them that acts as a negative affect on evil creatures that come too close. Only humans with good scores in both Strength and Charisma can become this class.Thieves: A high dexterity is a prime requisite for this class and they are restricted in wearing only leather-type armor and in using a limited number of weapons. Any race can be this class and it is considered an important one to have in the game to avoid getting the party killed whenever a trap is found.Rangers: They can use any weapon as a fighter can and can even dual wield melee weapons without any penalty, but only if they are not wearing heavy armor. Humans, elves, and half-elves are the only races that are allowed in the game that can be a part of this class.Cleric: They are holy warriors that can fight with a number of weapons and wear armor while casting divine spells against their enemies. Ideal for dealing with the undead as well as healing the party. Wisdom is the prime requisite for this class and any race can be a part of it.Mages: The spellcasters of the Realm, what they lack in armor and weapons expertise are made up for in the spells that they can weave. Unlike several other RPG systems of the time that utilized spell points, mages in AD&amp;D have to memorize a set number of spells in order to store and use them at a later time. Once those memorized spells are used up, the mage must take time to memorize another batch. Intelligence is the prime requisite for this class and as they gain in level, they also gain extra slots that can be used to store memorized spells. Humans, Elves, and Half-Elves can become mages in the game.Alignment[CR]AD&amp;D along with many other PnP RPGs at the time makes extensive use of an  alignment system to determine a character's worldview and how they conduct themselves within society which would also be reflected in EotB's mechanics as well as that of its following sequels.[CR]World View:Lawful: A character will work within the lawsNeutral: A character will move between valuing a society and valuing an individual.Chaotic: A character will choose the good of the individual above that of everything else.[CR]Ethics:Good: The character tries to act in a moral and upstanding manner.Neutral: A character leans towards evaluating 'situational ethics' depending on the circumstances.Evil: A character acts without regard for others or in an overly malignant manner.[CR]For example, a Lawful Good character would be by-the-book when it came to upholding the good in society while a Chaotic Good character would be more willing to bend the rules in order to provide the same. A Lawful Evil character might hold their word as their bond and be loathe to break it for anyone, but would only give it if confronted by someone whose power they respect or as a part of one of their fell schemes. As interesting as this was, the game did not make an extensive use of the potential that this system could bring to an RPG.Attributes[CR]Character  attributes would help determine what classes were available for certain characters and how well they would perform in them. In 2nd Edition AD&amp;D, attribute scores of 18 were considered the highest possible in a natural sense, although racial bonuses and magical effects/enhancements in the form of spells or items would be able to raise them higher either temporarily or permanently in more rare cases. These are set as far as the game was concerned. Leveling improved a character's HP (hit points) and general abilities, but their base statistics would almost never change.[CR]EotB and its  following sequels would also allow the player to modify statistics during character creation with any number of changes that were limited only by the maximum level a particular attribute could be as determined by race.Strength: This determines the amount of physical damage that a character can inflict. With a strength statistic of 18, an additional variable is added to indicate exceptional strength as a percentage shown as 18/23.Constitution: A character's health and toughness is determined by this. In AD&amp;D, this has other effects outside of simply determining the HP amount gained after every level, such as a character's resistance to certain physical effects.Intelligence: A vital attribute for mages as they learn spells.Dexterity: Characters with a high dexterity tend to be nimble and agile improving their AC (armor class) which measures how hard they are to hit in combat. Important for every class, but more so with others such as fighters and thieves. With a score of 16 or higher, fighters can negate some of the penalties levied against them for using dual weapons.Charisma: This determines how attractive or repulsive a character is to everyone around them, whether it is in how they carry themselves in conversation or appear in public. Important for paladins.Wisdom: A character's innate ability to judge situations and make the best choices. It is also important in spell resistance and particularly key for clerics. Higher wisdom scores above 13 also translate into extra spells that clerics can utilize.[CR]Combat[CR]Fighting in the game is handled through random encounters wherein experience, items, and gold are earned. The front ranks, determined by the two characters at the top of the party list, can engage in melee combat. All other characters must resort to ranged weapons or spells in order to join in the fight. An onscreen menu guides their actions and right clicking with the mouse on the appropriate icon, such as a warrior's sword, would cause them to act.[CR]Camping is available for the player to rest and heal the party, memorize spells, and save the game when necessary.[CR]NPC Companions[CR]As well as creating a party of player characters, during the adventure beneath the city of Waterdeep it is possible to find other adventurers who will offer their services to help the player characters in defeating Xanathar.TOD UPHILLTod is a Halfling Thief who accidentally fell down a sewer grate in the city of Waterdeep.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]F-1 Grand Prix is the first in a series of semi-serious F1 racing games from Video System. Originally released in the Arcades, it was later ported to the Super Famicom.[CR]The Super Famicom version uses a top-down view that centers the camera on the player's vehicle. Whenever the player turns or accelerates, the background moves around to compensate while the car sprite says completely static in the center. Before a race begins, the game uses the Super Famicom's mode 7 to show off the track at an angle and give players a sense of the twists and turns ahead.

			<title_clean>Famicom Tantei Club Part II - Ushiro ni Tatsu Shoujo</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The game's title screen depicts Ushimitsu High School, where the majority of the events take place.[CR]Famicom Tantei Club Part II: Ushiro ni Tatsu Shoujo (also known as Famicom Detective Club: The Girl in Back) is the second game in the Famicom Tantei Club franchise. It is a prequel to the first game, Famicom Tantei Club: Kieta Koukeisha. The game was originally released on two discs for the Famicom Disk System, the first disc released on May 23, 1989 and the second disc on June 30, 1989. The game was later redistributed as a Super Famicom game (with improved graphics and sound, added gameplay mechanics, and other minor changes) through Nintendo Power on April 1, 1998. On August 10, 2004, the game was released under the Famicom Mini Series for the Game Boy Advance (the Famicom Disk System version). The Super Famicom version was also released for the Virtual Console on April 30, 2008. Famicom Tantei Club Part II was developed by Nintendo R&amp;D1 and published by Nintendo.[CR]Despite never being released outside of Japan, the game has been unofficially translated into English by two people well-known for translating and ROM hacks: Tomato (known for work on Mother 3, Star Ocean, and official translations such as One Piece) and Demiforce (a group who have done ROM hacking work in games such as Radical Dreamers: Nusumenai Houseki and have developed the game Trism for the iPhone). They changed many graphic-related Japanese characters (such as on the school's sign), added a few American references (such as one to Law &amp; Order), and even added a reference to Demiforce (the protagonist can discover some graffiti that says "Demiforce forever!").[CR]In addition, one of the game's characters (Ayumi Tachibana) was a trophy in Super Smash Bros. Melee.Differences[CR]The Super Famicom version contained many differences from the Famicom Disk System version (not all gameplay related differences). It added the personal assessment seen at the end of the game, as well as the Ayumi compatibility rating. The personality assessment takes into account various factors (if the player is constantly touching girls, for example, they are given the flirtatious assessment). Ayumi's compatibility is based on whether or not the player flirted with other girls in the game, as well as kindness towards Ayumi.The Super Famicom version extended some cutscenes, and added more artistic touches.[CR]The graphics and sound of the Super Famicom version were also changed. The composer of both versions was Kenji Yamamoto (of Super Metroid fame). Most of the songs were either remixed or extended, but there were a few added songs. In addition, the better sound chip of the Super Famicom allowed for there to be synthesized voices for a few of the characters. In the search for Ayumi, the Super Famicom version is changed to a text and visual search (while the Famicom Disk System verison just had the player exploring a maze to find Ayumi).[CR]The Super Famicom version also added (or extended) many cutscenes. The Super Famicom version takes many things into effect, from sepia tone scenes, to scrolling, fading, animation, transparency, scrolling, and black and white scenes. In addition, the graphics "zoom in" on characters' faces during some scenes. Not all characters in the Famicom Disk System game were given sprites, but in the Super Famicom version, every character (no matter how minor) is given a sprite.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Investigating leads can be done through this menu.[CR]Famicom Tantei Club Part II is a traditional adventure game. The game is navigated through menus (such as Ask About, Check, Take, Open, Show, etc). Some actions only show up during certain portions, so not all are readily available (making the goal occasionally to "trigger" the next event by choosing the right options). At some points, there are portions where the player is quizzed on previous events in the game (such as who was murdered when, who was the witness, etc). Interacting with characters sometimes gives the player a choice of the next course of action, although each one ends up at the same eventual end.Like many adventure games, there are several command options.[CR]There is no way to get a game over, per se, but one female police officer does break the fourth wall. By choosing the Check option on the police officer's breasts, the police officer will give the player a fake game over, and then insult the protagonist every time she is spoken with from that point on. Other than this, there are no game overs (events in which the player is in danger have no time limit, giving the player unlimited time before triggering the next event). This makes the game more of an interactive story game than a point-and-click adventure game.[CR]The Super Famicom version had some added gameplay features, as well. It added a memo feature, which contained notes on every character in the game (except for the protagonist, Maruyama, Fumi Tazaki, Shunsuke Utsugi, and characters who are not given names). This memo feature is what is used to occasionally quiz the player. In addition, it is used as the review at the end of each chapter.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Utsugi and the protagonist share some coffee.[CR]The game opens with a young boy being pursued by two men. He runs, but bumps into another man and is caught by the two police officers. The man he bumped into introduces himself as a detective named Shunsuke Utsugi, and takes in the young boy (the protagonist of the game who ran away from an orphanage in order to find his long-lost parents). This scene is described as "three years ago."[CR]The scene shifts to "a few months later," where the boy is seen working as Utsugi's assistant. They are called in to investigate a murder; a teenage girl who (after the protagonist finds a notebook in the muck) is identified as Yoko Kojima. She was a student at Ushimitsu High School. As this is happening, Tatsuya Hibino (an English teacher at Ushimitsu, and Yoko's homeroom teacher) and Ayumi Tachibana (a close friend of Yoko's, and a member of Ushimitsu's detective team) show up. They are both shocked to find Yoko dead.Yoko's lifeless body shows up in the river.[CR]In the chapters following, the protagonist discovers a lot about Yoko Kojima and her life in the days and weeks preceding her murder. She was part of the school's detective team as well, and had been investigating a case on her own. She was investigating (unbeknownst to the rest of the team) The Tale of the Girl in Back, a "ghost story" that had been circulating around the school for many years. According to the rumor, if someone is in the hallway, alone, then they will hear a voice calling from behind them. Turning around, they will see a blood-soaked girl in a Ushimitsu school uniform. Naturally, the tale varies from student to student, but the core of the story stays the same.[CR]The story originated when Shinobu Asakawa, a student at Ushimitsu 15 years previous to the events of the game, went missing. Yoko's murder appears to be linked to another case, that of Genjiro Kaneda (an unsolved murder from 15 years ago). When Kaneda was murdered, Shinobu was supposedly the only eyewitness, although she disappeared. Solving that case also becomes a priority, as its statute of limitations is about to expire.Shinobu witnesses Genjiro's murder.[CR]Another teacher at Ushimitsu, Hisako Hayama, eventually reveals that she was the originator of The Tale of the Girl in Back, when she was a student at Ushimitsu. She said she was going to school to get some homework she forgot (which happened to be the very same night that Kaneda was murdered), and she heard a voice calling her name. Turning around, she saw a blood-soaked girl in a Ushimitsu school uniform. Hayama discovering the blood-soaked girl matches up with the timeline of the murder, making Shinobu's survival a possibility.[CR]The school's janitor, Toshio Tazaki is then introduced. He is generally hostile towards the protagonist in the greater half of the game. As the game progresses, he becomes more and more of a suspect, as he had a debt to Kaneda at the time of his murder. He did have a strong alibi (he was plastering a wall from the time of the murder to midnight) that was confirmed by the principal of the school, Tadashi Urabe (a man whom is respected by many). Hayama did pass by the wall on her way running from the blood-soaked girl (around the time of the murder), and Tazaki was not there, and the wall was unfinished. This means that Tazaki was lying about his alibi, and Urabe was covering for him.[CR]Tazaki is eavesdropping when Hayama reveals this to the protagonist, so he runs off (and the protagonist fails to catch him). Back at the detective agency, the protagonist is with Ayumi. Ayumi gives him some drugged coffee, and then sets out to search for Yoko's murderer alone (she strongly believes it is Tazaki). She feared for the protagonist's safety, and decided to take matters into her own hands. After the protagonist awakes, he quickly sets out to search for Ayumi. He tracks her to a downtown galleria, Tazaki's house, and then his mother (Fumi Tazaki), who leads him to a cliff. There, Tazaki is holding Ayumi with a knife over her head, threatening to stab her. He breaks, however, and says he cannot do it. Instead, he confesses that he did have a false alibi, but that he did not kill Kaneda or Yoko (Ayumi and the protagonist decide to believe him).Ayumi is tracked to the downtown galleria.[CR]In the next chapter, the protagonist finally confronts Urabe. He admits to providing a false alibi for Takazi. He is not regretful for that action at all, however, as he feels that protecting an innocent man is something worth lying for. In this chapter (and the many following it), it is seen that most of the teachers and students respect Urabe very much, not only as a principal, but as a man.[CR]While interrogating Tetsuharu Komada, one of the oldest teachers at Ushimitsu, the protagonist notices a portrait that looks strangely like Yoko. It ends up to be a portrait of Shinobu, who has an uncanny resemblance to Yoko (later revealed to be because of a blood relationship; Yoko is Shinobu's cousin). Ryoko Katsuragi, the painter of the portrait was good friends with Shinobu at the time, and reveals many things about Shinobu's personality (as well as revealing that Shinobu had a good friend with the last name of Uchida). "Uchida" matches the last name of Teruhiko Uchida, the original suspect in Kaneda's murder (who committed suicide days before).Tetsuharu Komada is one of the oldest teachers at Ushimitsu High School.[CR]Hitomi Kawai is then introduced. He was Yoko's best friend, and one of the members of Ushimitsu's detective club. He decides to help investigate his friend's murder. Through him, the protagonist discovers the Sambora Bar &amp; Saloon, a location that Goro Kaneda (Genjiro Kaneda's son) frequented. The bartender speaks of something Goro said while drunk (hinting that he knows who the killer is), so the protagonist heads to go interrogate Goro.[CR]At Goro's apartment, the protagonist sees two men struggling. Running in, the protagonist finds Goro dead of multiple stab wounds, and the murderer is running away in the parking lot. After calling in the police, the protagonist notices a pen clasped in Goro's hands, with the initials T.U. These initials match those of Teruhiko Uchida (the original suspect) and Tadashi Urabe (the principal).[CR]Supposedly during the murder, Urabe was out on business. So instead of pursuing that lead, the protagonist begins to uncover more about Shinobu's mysterious Uchida friend. Another friend of Shinobu, Sayaka Ishibashi, reveals that Uchida was the son of Teruhiko, named Tatsuya Uchida. In the yearbook, the protagonist discovers that Tatsuya is, in fact, Tatsuya Hibino. Hibino talks about how he hated the Kaneda family, and despite the fact he had no alibi, still denies being involved in Kaneda's murder (although he admits he is glad they are dead).[CR]Investigating a lead at the Sambora Bar &amp; Saloon, the protagonist discovers that Goro ten days previously had shouted out in joy that "he always wins." After discovering that at that time the news had been playing an interview with Urabe, expressing his sadness about Yoko's murder, the protagonist begins to more actively pursue the pen lead (suspecting it to be Tadashi Urabe). Hayama reveals that she could not contact Urabe at the hotel, but when she phoned his home, he was there. So, he has no alibi for being out of town.[CR]Suspecting Shinobu's body to still be on campus, the protagonist interrogates Tazaki a last time. He says that he did, at one point, take a break, and it seemed as though someone was tampering with his tools. Therefore, it was possible that someone took his tools and used them to hide the body. Returning to the detective agency, the protagonist gets an anonymous phone call saying that Urabe is at the school, and was responsible for all of the murders. Having left Ayumi and Hibino alone at the school, the protagonist races to Ushimitsu.The Girl in Back is the background to the main plot, and is never fully explained.[CR]After finding the two safe, they run into the principal's office. There, he is lying in a pool of his own blood, with a note that he supposedly wrote confessing to all of those murders. At that moment, Hibino finally breaks. He reveals he was, in fact, the murderer. When he went to kill Kaneda, he left a message on Urabe's answering machine revealing his intentions. When Urabe came to try and stop him, he accidentally hit a fleeing Shinobu (killing her on impact). Taking her back to the school, Hibino left her lying on the floor (Urabe later hid the body in a mirror). Hibino also murdered Goro and Yoko (whose body was also moved by Urabe). When Hibino corners Ayumi and the protagonist, he stabs a mirror, and the body of Shinobu falls out on top of him, stopping him long enough for the Maruyama (a detective), Utsugi, and the rest of the police force to arrive and take him into custody.[CR]In the ending cutscene, many other things are revealed relating to the personal discoveries of Utsugi. In addition, Ayumi is added to the detective agency as a full time detective (as well as Utsugi's assistant). The game ends with a personality assessment, compatibility with Ayumi, and a short epilogue for the first game, Famicom Tantei Club: Kieta Koukeisha (as Famicom Tantei Club Part II is a prequel).[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Main CharacterThe unamed protagonist[CR]The main character is a nameless young boy who ran away from an orphanage in an attempt to find his long-lost parents. He met Shunsuke Utsugi and became his assistant detective at 15 years old. The protagonist is then involved in solving the murder of Yoko Kojima. The player gets to decide on the protagonist's personality (and is given an assessment of it at the end of the game), as well as closeness to the another important character, Ayumi Tachibana.Ayumi TachibanaAyumi Tachibana[CR]Ayumi Tachibana is a good friend of the first murder victim, Yoko Kojima. She attends Ushimitsu High School during most of the game. Ayumi is also a member of Ushimitsu's detective club, so she helps the main character solve the murder of her friend (and the resulting murders). At the end of the game, she joins Utsugi and the protagonist in the detective agency, and returns as the main character of BS Tantei Club: Yuki ni Kieta Kako. Ayumi Tachibana is also 15 years old.Shunsuke UtsugiShunsuke Utsugi[CR]Shunsuke Utsugi is a 36 year old private detective (and the founder of the agency that the main character is a part of). Utsugi is regarded very highly by the police, so he is constantly being called in to assist in solving cases. During the events of the game, he is working on the murder of Genjiro Kaneda (which is revealed to be linked to the Yoko Kojima case).Yoko KojimaYoko Kojima[CR]Yoko Kojima is a 16 year old student at Ushimitsu High School, and the victim of the first murder in the game. She was investigating the legend of the Girl in Back at the time of her murder, which proves to be an important part of the story during the events of the game. Her best friend was Ayumi Tachibana, and the two of them were part of Ushimitsu's detective club.Hitomi KawaiHitomi Kawai[CR]Hitomi Kawai is another 16 year old student at Ushimitsu High School. He is the third member of the detective club at the high school, and was very close friends with Yoko Kojima. At first, he is very hostile towards the protagonist, but becomes friends over the course of the game. For most of the game, the main character finds Hitomi to be very odd (dressing in strange clothing, odd mannerisms, etc).Tatsuya HibinoTatsuya Hibino[CR]Tatsuya Hibino is the 31 year old English teacher at Ushimitsu High School. He was also the homeroom teacher for Yoko Kojima, and at first appears to be very disturbed and shaken by her murder. Later, he is revealed to be Tatsuya Uchida, son of Teruhiko Uchida (the murder suspect of Genjiro Kaneda). Hibino is later revealed to be the murderer behind Genjiro Kaneda, Yoko Kojima, and Goro Kaneda's deaths.Tadashi UrabeTadashi Urabe[CR]Tadashi Urabe is the 57 year old principal of Ushimitsu High School. He is well-respected by students and teachers alike, not only as a principal, but as a person. He is always calm and contained, but tries to protect everyone (to his detriment). He accidentally ran over Shinobu Asakawa 15 years previous to the events of the game.Hisako HayamaHisako Hayama[CR]Hisako Hayama is an alumna of Ushimitsu High School, and the 32 year old biology teacher at the school. Hayama is the originator of the legend of the Girl in Back. She came to school one night to get a homework assignment, heard a voice, and saw a bloodied Shinobu Asakawa. She is embarrassed to be the source of this legend, but remains firm in what she saw.Toshio TazakiToshio Tazaki[CR]Toshio Tazaki is the 58 year old janitor of Ushimitsu High School. At first, he appears to be the murderer of Genjiro Kaneda, as he had proper motives, a quick temper, and a debt to Genjiro Kaneda. However, he had an alibi (he was repairing a wall) that was confirmed by Urabe. When this alibi falls apart, Tazaki reveals that he really wasn't doing that, but that he wasn't the murderer (which ends up being true). He is normally calm, but can get very mad very quickly.Goro KanedaGoro Kaneda[CR]Goro Kaneda is Genjiro Kaneda's adopted son. After Genjiro's death, Goro inherited all of his wealth, making life very easy for Goro. During the events of the game, he begins to run out of money, so he blackmails Urabe (who he witnessed hitting Shinobu). Goro is later murdered in his apartment. At the time of his death, he was 31 years old.Tetsuharu KomadaTetsuharu Komada[CR]Tetsuharu Komada is the oldest teacher at Ushimitsu High School at 59 years old (he has been the art teacher for the school for 35 years). Thus, he provides much information to the protagonist (albeit cryptic information) over the course of the game. He is great friends with Urabe, so he respects him very much and gets angry when the protagonist begins to suspect Urabe as a murderer.Shinobu AsakawaShinobu Asakawa[CR]Shinobu Asakawa was a student of Ushimitsu High School who went missing 15 years before the events of the game (at age 16). She was the only witness of Genjiro Kaneda's murder. When she got hit by Urabe's car and ran off to Ushimitsu, Hayama saw her and began the tale of the Girl in Back.Genjiro KanedaGenjiro Kaneda[CR]Genjiro Kaneda was a hated pub owner who was murdered 15 years before the beginning of the game. Genjiro was hated due to tendency to demand outrageous amounts of interest after he loaned people money. He was the cause of many people's deaths, including Teruhiko Uchida, who committed suicide because of his debts toward Genjiro.Ryoko KatsuragiRyoko Katsuragi[CR]Ryoko Katsuragi is an alumna of Ushimitsu High School, and the painter of a portrait of Shinobu Asakawa. Ryoko provides much information about Shinobu that is helpful towards the investigation, including the last name of one of Shinobu's best friends: Uchida. This is later revealed to be Tatsuya Uchida, who later changes his name to Tatsuya Hibino.Sayaka IshibashiSayaka Ishibashi[CR]Sayaka Ishibashi is another alumna of Ushimitsu High School, and good friends with Ryoko Katsuragi during the events of the game. Sayaka gives the protagonist information on Shinobu, as she was in the same class as her. In addition, she brings a yearbook that helps the protagonist to identify Tatsuya Uchida as Tatsuya Hibino.Teruhiko UchidaTeruhiko Uchida (never seen in game)[CR]Teruhiko Uchida was the original murder suspect in the death of Genjiro Kaneda. Teruhiko owned a factory, but lost it because of Genjiro. He was very bitter over this, so he was the original murder suspect. However, he committed suicide two days before Genjiro's murder. Teruhiko is the father of Tatsuya Hibino.[CR]						</plot>

			<plot>"Farland Story" in the first in the row of successful Japanese strategy RPG games. The main hero of the game is a knight named Arc, who is in love with the beautiful priestess Ferio. One day, when Arc and his best friend Randia are out of town, a hostile army under the command of a mysterious Black Knight invades the town and kidnaps Ferio. Thus begins Arc's quest to defeat the enemies and to rescue his beloved one from their clutches.[CR]"Farland Story" consists entirely of battles (save cut scenes and the ability to shop if you are near a town after a battle). During battles, you move Arc and his party over the terrain, and attack when there are enemies in range. The party consists of different classes - knights attack with swords, archers specialize in long-ranged combat, priestesses heal, etc. Every attack leads to a counter-attack, from the enemy's side as well as from yours. You gain experience points for every attack, and can level up in the middle of a battle.</plot>

			<plot>Farland Story 2 is an independent side-story to the Farland Story series (this game shouldn't be confused with  Farland Story Denki: Arc Ou no Ensei, which is also known as "Farland Story 2"). The game is set in the same time line as the second and the third "mainstream" Farland Story games, 20 years after Arc has become a king. Peace has returned to the world, but on the continent of Ionia, an emperor is plotting an evil scheme. His son Riad refuses to accept the methods of his father, especially when he wants to use Serena, a girl he loves, for his plans of war and conquest. During a quarrel, Riad attacks the emperor's minister, and is forced to flee the castle together with Serena. The adventure of the runaway prince begins...[CR]Graphically and gameplay-wise, the game is similar to other Farland Story games, although its setting is generally more dark. The game consists of large strategic battles, during which you move your party over the battle location, attacking enemies physically when they are in range of your weapons, and casting healing and offensive magic. Like in other Farland Story games, the death of the main character (Riad in this case) means instant Game Over.</plot>

			<plot>In a fantasy world, a soldier from the imperial forces deserts after witnessing the massacre of innocent villagers by his unit. He is sent to jail to be executed, but manages to escape with the help of two former unit colleagues. The group flees through the country-side, while being pursued by imperial soldiers. On their way, they join forces with other rebels to fight against the enemy, while uncovering hidden secrets and evil plots by the Empire.[CR]FEDA: Emblem of Justice is a strategy RPG similar to Shining Force and other titles with preset characters and linear gameplay. The player commands a party of varying size and characters with diverse skills.[CR]In the main battle sections, the player and the CPU-controlled enemy take turns moving the troops and giving orders. A menu at the bottom of the screen shows all the possible actions, where soldiers can defend, move, attack, or use an inventory item on each turn. The range of their movements and weapons vary according to their nature. A crossbow character can shoot from the back, while most sword and knife users have to be adjacent to their targets. Magic offensive powers have different ranges as well, reaching enemies that are far away from the attacking character. Health points can be recovered by eating rations or by magic, where a healer can restore points to several characters at once.[CR]Each party member has separate health and magic points, as well as other statistics like defense and attack power. They receive experience points after slaying an enemy or casting a spell, and extra points at the end of the battle. Their skills increase after surpassing 100 points.[CR]The map screen shows the party and groups of enemies traveling through the landscape in turns. The menu has options for moving the group or camping. In the encampment, one of the characters around the fire pit saves the game, while another inside the tent provides system options to change the interface color, adjust sound volume and rename the party members.[CR]In some locations like temples, villages and towns, the party has to explore the place and talk to the citizens to move on to the next section. In later battles, the player has to make a moral choice about attacking mutated humans. At the end of each battle, the party is assigned a dark or light emblem, and certain party members choose to leave or stay in the group based on its alignment.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Final Fantasy IV (originally released as Final Fantasy II outside of Japan), is a console RPG in the Final Fantasy series first published by Square in 1991. It quickly became a fan favorite, a factor that has fuelled the several remakes of the game that have been created to date. The game's first appearance was on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and was released twice in Japan and once in the US: The US version was made purposefully easier, and the Japanese market would later receive the same version with the subtitle "Easy Type" three months after the original. Square later capitalized on its growing popularity with ports on the Sony PlayStation and the Game Boy Advance, and in 2008, nearly two decades after the original release, a completely overhauled remake was developed for the Nintendo DS.[CR]The game has had both critical and commercial success. It has also had a direct impact not only on future Final Fantasy games but on RPGs in general, with the introduction of a storyline driven by characters and character interaction and the use of new gameplay mechanics, such as the Active Time Battle system. Final Fantasy IV also made use of Mode 7, which allowed 2D backgrounds to be rotated and viewed in a way that gave the impression of 3D. The music was composed by Nobuo Uematsu.[CR]A sequel, Final Fantasy IV: The After Years, was released for mobiles in 2008 and on WiiWare in 2009.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The overworld (DS)[CR]Final Fantasy IV lets the player take control of a party, led by the protagonist, Cecil Harvey. Throughout the game, the party explores towns and dungeons to progress the story. The individual locations are all tied together in an overworld, which the player can traverse on foot, though by the end of the game, a hovercraft and a number of different airships are available to get around the overworld faster and to cross shoals and oceans.[CR]Random encounters populate the overworld and dungeons. When the player is met by one, the party is thrown into a battle against up to five enemies. Winning the battle rewards the party with experience points, gil, and occasionally a dropped item. Gil is the game's currency and is used in shops to buy new weapons, armor, or other items in towns, while by accumulating experience points, a character may gain a level and subsequently receive a boost in stats. The party will also come across bosses over the course of the game, who are often tougher to defeat than regular enemies from random encounters as they usually have more health and stronger attacks.The town of Baron (SNES)[CR]Besides fighting through dungeons, there are also a large number of castles, towns, and villages that usually include several NPCs, an inn (where the party can rest for the night for a small fee), and a few shops. Progress can be permanently saved either in the overworld or at save points sparsely scattered in dungeons or, more rarely, towns. The DS remake includes a portable-friendly quicksave feature that lets the player save at any point, but once this quicksave file is loaded, it is erased.[CR]Though Final Fantasy IV has twelve playable characters in total, only five are present at any one time. This means that the player never decides the party members. Cecil is the only character who remains in the party for the entire duration of the game, and characters often leave the party due to story-related reasons with very little warning. Party members' equipment can be customized, as well as the party's formation. The party is arranged into two rows, front and back, and each row holds a maximum of three members. Characters in the back row receive slightly less damage compared to the front, being further back, but attacks do less damage.Battle SystemThe ATB system (GBA)[CR]Final Fantasy IV has an ATB (Active Time Battle) system, which was eventually used in many subsequent Final Fantasy games. Each character has a gauge that fills up automatically as time passes. A character with a high speed statistic will have their gauge filled more quickly. When a character's gauge is full, the character can perform an action. In Final Fantasy IV, attacking, using an ability or item, summoning, and casting a spell all counts as one action. Once this action is complete, the gauge is reset. Enemies also have their own gauges, but these are kept hidden to the player. Slow and Haste spells can be cast to affect how quickly gauges are filled.[CR]Members on both sides all enter a battle with a number of HP (hit points), the game's equivalent to health. Damage is dealt to someone by performing physical or magical attacks. When someone's HP reaches zero, they are KO'd and no longer play a part in battle unless they are revived. A side is victorious when all of their enemies are KO'd or Petrified (turned to stone), although a battle ends earlier if one side flees. Party members have options to restore HP, through Cure spells and items like potions, and revive a KO'd character, through Raise spells and phoenix downs.[CR]Characters also have a reserve of MP (magic points). This number dictates what magic spells or summons can be cast. Each act of magic comes with an MP cost, with more powerful or useful magic usually coming at a higher price, and that cost is subtracted from the character's overall MP reserve whenever it is used. Magic is divided into two types: White Magic and Black Magic. White consists of holy spells that usually focus on healing; Black has spells that look to harm their targets.Rydia inflicted with the Toad status (DS)[CR]Another key aspect is the assortment of status effects that can be inflicted on characters. These are usually casted by magic users. Positive status effects include Protect and Shell, which raises the character's physical and magical defense respectively. Blink temporarily makes the character much harder to hit. There are plenty of harmful ones, too. For example, Poison slowly drains the character of their health, while Silence prevents them from spellcasting. Characters inflicted with Sleep cannot do anything until they awaken. Negative status effects can be cured through the spell Esuna or particular items.[CR]Each playable character in the game also comes with their own unique abilities. Kain comes with the Jump ability, allowing him to stay airborne for a while before crashing down on an enemy dealing double damage, while Yang has Kick, which enables him to deal physical damage to all enemies in one turn.[CR]In the DS remake, these abilities can be taught to other characters via items called augments, obtained by story events or by other means. There are no character restrictions when it comes to augments, which means any character can learn anything. However, in battle, a maximum of four abilities can be used (not including the auto-battle feature). The fifth slot is given to items. This remake also introduces new abilities that are only available through augments. Some are active, like Tsunami, a powerful water attack, while others are passive, like Treasure Hunter, which increases the chance of enemies dropping items after the battle.Summons/Eidolons[CR]During battle, Rydia can summon an Eidolon to perform a powerful attack on the enemies. When Cecil first meets Rydia as a young girl, she only knows how to summon a Chocobo, but she is eventually able to bring forth much more powerful summons as the game is progressed. By the end of the game, she can summon the following Eidolons, providing all the relevant sidequests are completed and treasures are collected:Leviathan using Tidal Wave (DS)ChocoboIfritShivaRamuhDragonTitanOdinSylphAsuraLeviathanBahamutGoblinBombMindflayerCockatriceWhyt (DS version only)[CR]Exclusive to the DS version of the game, Whyt is unique to every other summon in that it can fight in Rydia's place, and as it is the only one whose stats can be increased. Boosting stats is done by playing a group of minigames.New Game Plus (DS version only)[CR]The DS remake includes a New Game Plus feature, with which players can begin a second playthrough with some of the benefits from the previous playthrough. Map data, augments (both used and unused), and certain special items are carried over. Gil, levels, and nearly all of the equipment are not. New Game Plus can only be utilized two times for a single "game", meaning three playthroughs of the game are allowed.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Warning: This section depicts the events that happen from beginning to end, and thus contains major spoilers.The Light CrystalsCecil returning from Mysidia[CR]The game starts as Cecil Harvey, Lord Captain of the Red Wings and a dark knight, is returning to the kingdom of Baron, having collected the Crystal of Water from the city of Mysidia on the king's orders. At the castle, he questions the motives behind attacking the peaceful Mysidians and forcefully taking what is theirs, but is subsequently stripped of his rank. Protesting his loyalty to the king, Cecil accepts a mission along with friend and dragoon Kain to deliver a ring to the village of Mist, its power unknown to him. Upon arriving, the ring automatically lets out a group of bombs that explode and destroy the village. In the wake of what has been done, Cecil and Kain vow to rebel against the King of Baron.[CR]They stumble upon the village's only survivor, a young girl named Rydia, who is devastated by the loss of her mother. Out of rage, she summons Titan, causing an earthquake that separates Cecil from Kain. Alone with an unconscious Rydia, Cecil takes the girl to an inn at the nearest town, Kaipo. When Baron soldiers arrive at the inn looking to take away Rydia, Cecil defends her against them. Rydia witnesses the scene and warms to Cecil after his gesture. Not long afterwards, Rosa (whom Cecil has feelings for) is found outside Kaipo, sick from an illness called desert fever. She grew concerned after hearing about the events in Mist and went in search of him. Cecil and Rydia head to Damcyan Castle for assistance in finding a sand pearl, the cure, and are joined by Tellah, an old sage looking for his eloping daughter.Cecil and Rydia meeting Edward[CR]However, the trio find Damcyan Castle being attacked by the Red Wings, and by the time they reach inside, they find a significant number of casualties, including Tellah's daughter, Anna. Edward, the bard Anna eloped with, is also the Prince of Damcyan, and tells of how Golbez led the Red Wings and took the Fire Crystal for themselves. Tellah, enraged by his daughter's death, leaves by himself to exact revenge on Golbez. After snapping out of a state of mourning by Cecil, Edward helps Cecil and Rydia retrieve a sand pearl from an antlion, and Rosa recovers from desert fever. Through Edward's knowledge, the party learns that Fabul is the next target of the Red Wings, as it has the Wind Crystal.Golbez's first appearance[CR]As they head towards the next Crystal, the quartet encounter a Fabul monk, Yang. Yang heeds their warning about the impending attack and takes them to Fabul Castle, moments before Golbez's Red Wings arrive. They are forced to retreat to the Crystal chamber, where Kain, now working for Golbez, defeats Cecil in a duel. At this moment, Golbez makes his entrance, easily fending off attacks from the party, and orders Kain to retrieve the Crystal. While Kain complies, Golbez notices that Cecil cares for Rosa, and kidnaps her before taking his leave with Kain and the Crystal.[CR]Cecil realizes that they are no match against the airships of the Red Wings, and so the party starts heading towards Baron seeking the aid of Cid, the constructor of the airships. However, while at sea, they come across Leviathan, a feared monster known as the Lord of All Waters. Cecil ends up washed ashore near Mysidia, separated from everyone else. The Mysidians are hostile towards Cecil, but despite this, the Elder of Mysidia agrees to help Cecil in his plight against Golbez, and tells the dark knight that a dark sword cannot slay Golbez. Cecil must first rid himself of darkness at the top of Mount Ordeals.Cleansing the Darkness[CR]Accompanied by twin mages Palom and Porom, Cecil ascends the mountain. Halfway up, he reunites with Tellah, who is seeking to learn the powerful spell Meteor to defeat Golbez, even if using the spell means losing his life. The four of them reach the summit, overpowering Scarmiglione, one of four elemental archfiends working for Golbez, along the way. At the mountaintop, a light greets the party, calling Cecil "son", before teleporting everyone to an isolated room, where Cecil proves his worth by defeating the dark knight version of himself. Cecil is rewarded by being made a paladin and receives a sword of light.Porom and Palom agreeing to sacrifice their lives[CR]In Baron, after reuniting with Yang (he tells Cecil that Rydia was swallowed by Leviathan), Cecil and his companions attempt to rescue Cid, who is locked inside the castle. They first confront the King of Baron, and find out that another archfiend working for Golbez, Cagnazzo, killed and was impersonating the king all along. After defeating Cagnazzo, the party find Cid and together, they plan to leave on Cid's latest airship invention, which he calls the Enterprise. However, Cagnazzo's last act is to trap the party in a room where the walls are caving in on them. Palom and Porom sacrifice their lives by turning themselves into stone to stop the walls.[CR]Golbez, meanwhile, arrives at a complication in trying to obtain the fourth and final Crystal, as it has already been stolen by a dark elf, so Kain proposes an exchange to the party: the Earth Crystal from Troia for Rosa. The party kills the dark elf with outside assistance from Edward, who was found recovering in Troia Castle's infirmary. With the Earth Crystal, Cecil and his companions are led to the Tower of Zot to make the exchange. However, Golbez doesn't stick to his end of the bargain after taking the Crystal.[CR]Tellah confronts the man responsible for the death of his daughter and unleashes Meteor on him, but it does little damage against Golbez (though he loses his hold on a mind-controlled Kain), while mortally wounding the sage. Cecil lashes out at Golbez, but is easily swatted down. As Golbez prepares to deliver the final blow, he becomes shocked by a reason unbenownst to everyone else and walks away. Cecil, Yang, and Cid tend to Tellah, who dies from his wounds, his last words begging for Anna to be avenged. Kain, now free to control his own actions, leads Cecil to Rosa, and the pair are reunited once more. With archfiend Barbariccia killed, Rosa teleports everyone out from the crumbling tower.The UnderworldThe Dwarven Castle[CR]Back at Baron Castle, Kain tells the group that there are actually eight Crystals that Golbez needs. While Golbez has the four Light Crystals, there are four Dark Crystals in the underworld. These Crystals can be used to open a "way to the moon". The party travel to the village of Agart, where they open the seal, and once they reach the underworld, they see the Red Wings engaged in combat against a dwarven tank battalion. Inside the Dwarven Castle, King Giott informs Cecil and his friends that Golbez already has two Dark Crystals (a total of six Crystals in his possession).[CR]Golbez enters to steal the seventh Crystal from the Crystal chamber, revealing that he intends to use the Crystals to reactivate the Tower of Babil and thus the gate to the moon. With help from Rydia, now a young lady, Cecil's party overpowers their nemesis, but fails to stop him from escaping with the Crystal. Rydia explains that Leviathan carried her to the Feymarch, the land of the Eidolons. She lived among the Eidolons for several years, and because time flows differently in the Feymarch, she now appears to have grown so much in such a short space of time.[CR]The final Crystal lies in the Sealed Cave up north, but King Giott tells Cecil to go to the Tower of Babil and try to steal the other seven Crystals while Golbez is distracted in acquiring the eighth. On the way to the summit of the tower, Yang and Cid both sacrifice their lives. Yang destroys the Tower of Babil's cannons, which were about to destroy the dwarven army, while Cid activates a bomb to give the rest of the party enough time to flee Golbez's pursuing airship.Edge swearing revenge against Rubicante[CR]Cecil and his group also encounter Edge, Eblan's prince, who is pursuing revenge against the last archfiend, Rubicante, responsible for Eblan Castle's slaughter and the demise of his parents. Together, they defeat Rubicante and have the seven Crystals in their sight before they fall down several floors through a trap door. They are forced to abandon their plans of reacquiring the Crystals and make their way to the Sealed Cave. After the group beats Golbez to the final Crystal, though, Kain's mind is once again taken over by Golbez, and the dragoon steals the Crystal from them and takes it to Golbez. When the party reports back the news that Golbez now has all eight Crystals, King Giott tells them to go to Mysidia.The MoonFusoya the Lunarian[CR]Cecil and his companions make their way back to Mysidia, where the Elder's prayers summon the Lunar Whale, an extremely technologically advanced ship, from the ocean. With it, they travel to the moon and meet Fusoya, a Lunarian and inhabitant of the moon. Fusoya is the guardian of the Lunarians, charged with preserving the tranquility of their slumber. The Lunarians came from another planet, but were forced to flee after its destruction. They came across Earth, but because the people of Earth were still evolving and had not caught up with the Lunarians, they decided to hibernate until Earth had caught up.[CR]However, one Lunarian named Zemus did not want to sleep, and wanted to destroy all existing life on Earth to claim the planet as their own. He was forced into hibernation with the others, but his will grew stronger in sleep and took a consciousness of its own, reaching out to Golbez and manipulating him to do his bidding. The Crystals function as a source of energy, and all eight combined will be enough to summon the Giant of Babil, a robotic being powerful enough to extinguish all life on Earth. Fusoya also had a younger brother, Kluya. The Lunar Whale belonged to Kluya, and he flew it to Earth where he fell in love with a woman and had two children, one of whom was Cecil. Cecil realizes that the voice he heard at Mount Ordeals was in fact Kluya's.[CR]Fusoya accompanies Cecil and his party back to Earth to stop the Giant of Babil. Yang, Cid, Palom, and Porom, all thought to have been deceased, are alive and along with Edward stagger the Giant, allowing Cecil's party to enter inside to destroy the controls from within. After successfully obliterating the CPU, they are met by an angry Golbez. Fusoya, however, performs a spell to help Golbez break out of Zemus' hold. Golbez reveals that he is also a son of Kluya, and thus Cecil's brother. Golbez was easily manipulated by Zemus as a young child after his father was killed by villagers and his mother died in childbirth when Cecil was born. Golbez took Cecil and left him at the edge of Baron; Cecil was found and raised by the king. Wanting to put an end to all of this madness, Golbez now sets off to the moon to kill Zemus. He is accompanied by Fusoya.Zemus is killed[CR]Kain, now free from Golbez's mind control, rejoins Cecil, Rosa, Rydia, and Edge, and the five head for the moon's core to assist in defeating Zemus. They see Golbez and Fusoya end Zemus' life, but Zemus' spirit is resurrected as Zeromus, fed by Zemus' hate. Golbez and Fusoya are no match for Zeromus, and are easily defeated. Cecil's party then faces Zeromus, but once again, Zeromus is too strong. All seems to be lost until the prayers of Cecil's friends on Earth, led by the Mysidian Elder, bestow strength and vitality on the party, and the party defeats Zeromus.[CR]After the final battle, Fusoya returns to hibernation and is joined by Golbez, who admits that he can't return to Earth after everything he has done. As Golbez leaves, Cecil acknowledges Golbez as his brother. Back on Earth, while Cecil is preparing for his coronation ceremony with Rosa, he hears Golbez's voice bidding him farewell as the moon leaves the Earth's orbit. The final scene is the coronation itself, as all of Cecil and Rosa's friends, except for Kain who is on Mount Ordeals, come to see the couple being crowned as Baron's new king and queen.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Final Fantasy IV includes twelve playable characters.Cecil Harvey as a paladinCecil - Dark Knight / Paladin - The game's central protagonist. Cecil Harvey used to command the Red Wings airship fleet, prior to being banished from the Kingdom of Baron after doubting the king's motives. He soon finds himself trying to stop the Earth's Crystals falling into the wrong hands. Cecil's "Dark Wave" attack as a Dark Knight is missing from the North American 1991 SNES release.Kain - Dragoon - Despite being childhood friends with Cecil, Kain Highwind's true allegiance is unclear. Kain has feelings towards Rosa, but hides them to avoid sabotaging the relationship between her and Cecil. In battle, he is a powerful fighter, with strong attacks and armor.Rydia - Summoner - Rydia, a seven year-old girl, is a summoner from the village of Mist, forced to accompany Cecil following the destruction of her home. Though she is handy with magic, Rydia becomes much more powerful later in the game, when she learns how to command powerful magic spells and summon an array of powerful creatures to aid her companions in battle. Her "Summon" command is localized as "Call", and the Eidolons are referred to as "summoned monsters" in the 1991 North American SNES release.Tellah - Sage - A sage hailing from Mysidia, Tellah knows a great deal of powerful magic spells. He seeks to track down his daughter Anna, who has eloped with a bard. Tellah is growing old, and acknowledges that he might not have many years left.Edward - Bard - Edward Chris von Muir is not only a bard with a harp but also the Prince of Damcyan. While not being the strongest of fighters, Edward is a useful addition to the party. For example, his mystical songs can help to put enemies to sleep.Rosa FarrellRosa - White Mage - An experienced yet kind-hearted mage, Rosa Farrell can learn a number of healing spells to strengthen up the party without having to resort to using up precious items. She is also competent with the bow. Rosa and Cecil have romantic feelings for each other. Rosa's "Pray" ability is missing from the original 1991 North American SNES release.Yang - Monk - Yang Fang Leiden is an extremely respected monk of Fabul, who aids Cecil in his quest. Humble, loyal, and married, he knows how to deal strong physical damage to his enemies that stand in his way. Yang is missing two abilities from the original 1991 North American SNES release: one which enables him to sacrifice his turn to double the power of his next attack; and one which enables him to sacrifice his turn to double his defense for that turn.Palom - Black Mage - Though young and inexperienced, Palom is a talented mage. He comes from Mysidia, and while being noted for his arrogance (he declares himself as "The Mysidian Genius"), this is kept in check by his twin sister, Porom. Palom is missing his "Bluff" ability in the 1991 North American SNES release, which buffed his black magic power.Porom - White Mage - Despite being already proficient in the art of magic, Porom has a great deal to learn. As an apprentice, she wants all the experience she can get. Porom is quite the opposite of Palom, as she has polite and well-mannered compared to her twin brother's confident personality. Porom is missing her "Cry" ability from the North American 1991 SNES release, which flusters the party's enemies and increases the chance for a successful escape.Cid - Engineer - Cid Pollendina is the constructor of the Red Wings airships. He has a daughter in Baron and is the main source of comic relief when he travels with Cecil. Cid is a physical fighter, but can also check an enemy's stats and weaknesses.Edge - Ninja - Edge's hot temper is counteracted only by his thirst for justice. He is the prince of the ancient island of Eblan, and has honed his abilities to a high standard. Edge often flirts with women and thinks rather highly of himself.Fusoya - Sage - Fusoya is a Lunarian and an inhabitant of the moon. First appearing near the endgame, he is aware of why the Crystals are so keenly sought for, and knows some things about Cecil that the protagonist doesn't even know. FuSoYa is missing his whole-party "Regen" battle command in the 1991 North American SNES release.[CR][B]References:[/B][CR]Dante Alighieri's Inferno[CR]Final Fantasy IV features villains named after five of the Malebranches from Dante Alighieri's The Divine Comedy, specifically Inferno. The game's elemental fiends are named directly after Scarmiglione (earth), Cagnazzo (water), Barbariccia (wind) and Rubicante (fire). In the original SNES North American 1991 release, they were spelled "Milon", "Kainazzo", "Valvalis" and "Rubicant" respectively. Another boss encounter features a collection of enemies known as Calcabrina, also misspelled in the 1991 North American release as "Calbrena".Mythology and Religion[CR]As is commonplace throughout the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy IV features references to Norse mythology, Hinduism, Islam and other religions and lore, including but not limited to the following:[CR]SummonsOdin (Norse Mythology)Bahamut (Islam)Ifrit (Islam)Shiva (Hinduism)Asura (Hinduism)Titan (Greek Mythology)Leviathan (Judaism, Christianity)[CR]WeaponryRagnarok (Norse mythology); originally localized as a "Crystal" sword in the original 1991 SNES North American releaseExcalibur (King Arthur)Gungnir (Norse mythology)Murasame (from the Japanese novel, Nans&#333; Satomi Hakkenden)Artemis Bow (Greek mythology)[CR]ArmorMinerva Bustier (Roman mythology)Gaia Gear (Greek mythology)Aegis Shield (Greek mythology)Hades Helmet and Gloves (Greek mythology)Other Final Fantasy Games[CR]The game features several series staples, such as Chocobos, the character Cid, airships, and the Crystals.[CR]The original Final Fantasy II (which first appeared on Nintendo's Famicom) also contains a town named Mysidia.[CR]In addition, the music that plays in the Tower of Babil is almost identical to that which plays in an endgame tower in The Final Fantasy Legend (Game Boy), known originally as SaGa in Japan.[CR]Version Differences[CR]Final Fantasy IV has been released numerous times over the years with various tweaks that distinguish one from another:Final Fantasy IV on the SNESFinal Fantasy IV: The standard version of Final Fantasy IV originally released for the Super Famicom in Japan.Final Fantasy IV Easy Type: A rebalanced version of the game that is easier than the standard difficulty. Certain features and items, such as Cecil's Darkness ability, were also stripped from the game in order to further simplify it. Ailment-specific healing items, for example, were combined into a single, all-encompassing, more expensive healing item. Although it is believed that this is the version of the game originally released in North America as Final Fantasy II for the SNES, Final Fantasy II and Final Fantasy IV Easy Type have certain differences, such as thematic censorship, different removed abilities, and a completely different version of Zeromus.Final Fantasy II: To prevent confusion among consumers, the original North American version of the game for the Super Nintendo was renamed because the Famicom games Final Fantasy II and Final Fantasy III weren't available outside of Japan at the time. This version of the game is largely identical to the Japanese Final Fantasy IV Easy Type edition of the game, but features additional cuts and alterations for the North American audience. Two of the more prominent cuts were removing certain story details about Fusoya being Cecil's uncle and Kain's desire to live in his father's footsteps as a Dragon Knight instead of being pushed into a life as a Black Knight. Some parts of the game were also censored, most notably references to death as well as scenes and dialogue that could have been considered "more PG-13 than PG".Final Fantasy IV (Final Fantasy Chronicles release): A PlayStation port released in North America as part of a bundle with the PlayStation port of Chrono Trigger. It is a translated version of Hard Type, but as a port it suffers from long loading times not present in the Super Famicom/SNES release. There is also some choppiness in scenes that utilize Mode 7 because the PlayStation doesn't support it.Final Fantasy IV Advance: A port of Hard Type for the Game Boy Advance, complete with a rewritten translation and an extra dungeon not found in the original console versions. The North American version of the game is known for suffering from numerous bugs, such as Yang's HP not increasing after level 60, some of the weapons being treated as armor, random extra turns being given to characters in battle, and certain weapons designed to be long-range not counting as long-range attacks. Many of the bugs were fixed for other regional releases.Final Fantasy IV DS: A fully re-done version of the game for the Nintendo DS, complete with 3D graphics, a new script with added scenes and dialogue, and voice acting. The game lacks the extra dungeon found in the GBA release, but does contain extras such as the augment feature, New Game, an event theater to watch cutscenes, and Whyt, a new Eidolon for Rydia who can replace Rydia in battle and whose stats can be raised by scoring well in a collection of new minigames. The DS version also added several fully 3D CGI cutscenes. For more information about the key changes of this remake, see the DS page of Final Fantasy IV.Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection: A hi-res version of Final Fantasy IV for the PSP featuring completely redone graphics and the inclusion of the Lunar Ruins bonus dungeon from Final Fantasy IV Advance. The collection also comes with a graphically remade version of the Wii release The After Years and a new Final Fantasy IV Interlude that bridges the gap between the original game and the After Years.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The Final Fantasy IV Original Sound Version was released on June 14, 1991, and includes 44 tracks from the game composed by Nobuo Uematsu. "Theme of Love" is one of Final Fantasy IV's most well-known tunes.Track ListingThe PreludeThe Red WingsKingdom of BaronTheme of LovePrologueWelcome to Our Town!Main Theme of Final Fantasy IVBattle 1FanfareEnter Fat ChocoboChocobo ChocoboInto the DarknessBattle 2Bomb RingRydiaDamcyan CastleSorrow and LossEdward's HarpMt.

During a relatively early part of the story, Tellah vents his fury at Edward, a bard, and shouts:[CR]You spoony bard![CR]This line became famous enough that it has been retained in all subsequent remakes. It was referenced in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations.[CR]Final Fantasy IV's presence was also felt in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. Culex, a hidden boss in the game who is designed to appear like a Final Fantasy boss, arrives in the Mushroom Kingdom to conquer it, but finds it uninhabitable. on his return home, he encounters Mario and challenges him. His boss theme is the same as the regular boss theme of Final Fantasy IV, while his epilogue tune is also the main theme of Final Fantasy.[CR]Final Fantasy IV: The After Years[CR]The sequel to Final Fantasy IV[CR]Final Fantasy IV: The After Years is a mobile phone and Wii sequel to Final Fantasy IV. It is set seventeen years after the events of the original, and follows Ceodore, the son of Cecil and Rosa. The first two chapters of the game were released in February 2008 in Japan. In June 2009, they were released for the Wii's Wiiware service in North America and Europe. The remaining nine episodes are now available on Wiiware.[CR]The After Years features random encounters and an ATB system like the original, but also introduces some fresh gameplay elements, such as the Age of the Moon and the Band System.[CR]Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection[CR]Final Fantasy IV: The Complete Collection is a PSP compilation featuring Final Fantasy IV and its episodic sequel, The After Years. The collection also features an all-new episode set between the events of the original game and its sequel. This game allows players to start with either the Interlude portion, The After Years, or the original Final Fantasy IV story. The only exception is that the player must complete the first episode of The After Years to open the other episodes, which can then be played in any order.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255 of  Anything Glitch[CR]There are two ways in which you can perform this glitch. For this first method, you need Cecil, the Avenger weapon, and a bow and some arrows. You must also have one blank slot in the inventory. Equip him with the bow and arrows in the field in his left and right hands repsectively. Enter a battle and then enter the items menu. Go to the Equip menu at the top of the list and select the arrows, then select a blank slot in your inventory. Then switch Cecil's bow with the Avenger and then have Cecil win the battle by having only him attack. Post-battle, you'll notice a symbol reading "A2" in Cecil's right hand. Unequip the Avenger and then put something into this right hand (the item to be duplicated), then unequip that weapon to earn 255 (seen as A2) of it. [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255 of  Anything Glitch[CR]There is a second method for this. You will need someone with a bow and arrows and the Berserk spell. The character whose items are to be duplicated must not be the one casting Berserk. Have the non-Berserker equip a bow in their weak hand and arrows in their dominant hand. Have things set up so that this character will go immediately after the Berserker (such as by killing off the other two characters). Enter a battle and cast Berserk on the character with the bow, then quickly make the bow-wielder enter their items menu and unequip the arrows. They will now have "A2" in their hand post-battle. From there, you can do the process detailed as in the previous paragraph to clone whatever you wish.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255 of  Anything Glitch[CR]This glitch will allow you to greatly increase the EXP., items, and GP won from battles. For this to work, you must have a character able to use Life or have the Life1 item. Use the aforementioned item/spell on a low-HP foe and then have the next character in the turn order kill the foe. (Note that it is much more reliable to use Tornado for this.) When the foe dies - regardless of cause, though it must be timed properly if you don't use Tornado - the Life spell or Life1 item will revive the foe. However, the foe comes back with 0 HP and immediately dies. The game will however consider that the foe was killed twice, thus increasing what you earned from it.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255 of  Anything Glitch[CR](Note that this glitch can be executed in several ways: however, to avoid saturation with technical details, I will speak in examples. Also be sure to note that this is only functional on Japanese v1.0 releases: this is, in fact, the only thing that changed between v1.0 and v1.1.)[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255 of  Anything Glitch[CR]To begin this glitch, begin by leaving one of a set of special areas: these include Mist Cave, the west side of Mt. Hobs, the Antlion's cave, and the basement areas of Troia (which must be done by Exit). From there, you must get to the Underworld and then get into a battle once there. The game mixes up various bits of data and loads enemies into the battle improperly to the point that the game must execute its fail-safe for when enemies are loaded very wrongly: that is, the game overrides their attacks such that they only will cast Stone on themselves until they die. This can allow you to easily earn EXP., Gil, and items.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255 of  Anything Glitch[CR]To begin with, you will need Edge. You will also need the equipment that you want to equip (but normally cannot) to not be in the inventory,  but held by someone else, and will also need Active Battle activated  in the Config menu. Enter battle with a monster who has the preferred steal item and have Edge target the enemy using Sneak. The next character will be the one who wants to equip the unequippable equipment: if the turn order is not ideal for this, you must kill off the other characters. In any case, once this character gets their turn immediately after Edge, enter the Items menu: if you managed to do so before Edge stole the item, the unequippable equipment will not be grayed-out. This means you can go to the desired equipment, select it, and scroll up to the Equip menu and equip it. To actually apply stat changes, you'll need to go to the Equip screen for this character then their Status menu page in the field.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255 of  Anything Glitch[CR]Note that you'll need a Tent to execute this glitch. While on the world map, as you move between two tiles, rapidly press X: if you do it quickly enough, you'll enter the menu mid-step. From there, if you use a Tent, you'll fool the game into having its hit detection off by a single tile. This fact will in turn allow you to skip visiting Mist (thereby allowing you to keep Kain, but you cannot get Rydia). You can also now enter Mist from its east side to be able to peruse its relatively-advanced shops.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255 of  Anything Glitch[CR]However, note that if you do use this glitch to bypass Mist, you must also use it later to bypass the events in Damcyan as the battle with Tellah and Edward will glitch, forcing the game to freeze.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255 of  Anything Glitch[CR]If you put Sylph in the top-right slot of Rydia's summon list (all SNES versions), or put Rydia in the very bottom position in your party (on the Wii Virtual Console versions), then when you cast the Sylph summoning spell it will not cost anything.  You must still have enough MP to cast the spell in order to use it.  This spell is great as it does good damage to one enemy and heals your entire party at the same time.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255 of  Anything Glitch[CR]You will only only be able to dupicate items that can be held in the Left Hand or Right Hand. A great way to get loads of Excaliburs to throw. Go into battle. Now select an empty slot in your item list. Now keep pressing UP until you get to the equipment list for the Left and Right Hand. Select the item that you want to duplicate. Now escape from the battle by holding L+R.  Open up the menu and go to the character equipment. Re-equip your item. You will notice it has a "2" next to it. De-Equip it and then Re-equip it, to "split it in half." [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255 of  Anything Glitch[CR]Monster encounters in this game are encoded much as in previous Final Fantasies: they are encoded on a gridular basis so that every single grid tile has its own set of encounters. However, sometimes parts of the overworld can unintentionally cross these gridlines, allowing you to fight later-game monsters than intended for the purpose of quick-leveling or item drop abuse. In Final Fantasy II/IV, you can find such an area due north of Mt. Ordeals, letting you fight monsters from Mythril and Troia.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255 of  Anything Glitch[CR]This glitch will allow you to skip the Sealed Cave dungeon. After Rydia rejoins the party as an adult, and after speaking with King Giott soon thereafter, have Rydia use Warp. You will be returned to the Crystal Room where you can pick up the Dark Crystal and leave to the throne room. When you proceed to the Sealed Cavern, the game will act as if you already earned the Crystal from within the dungeon. Due to the game's plot, there will now be no need to actually attempt to enter the dungeon for the Crystal within. However, note that, if you wish to obtain treasures from within the dungeon, you must go to it with one less party member.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255 of  Anything Glitch[CR]There are a number of spell effects that work oddly with the Stop spell to create odd glitches based on what spell Stop is combined with. To execute the glitch with the named effects, simply cast Stop on a foe who is affected by the named ailment. Note that not all of these will work on every version, and there is a possibility the game may freeze in every instance of this. [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255 of  Anything Glitch[CR]- Stop + Paralyze: This can indefinitely paralyze.[CR]- Stop + Sleep: This can indefinitely keep someone asleep.[CR]- Stop + Gradual Petrify: This can fend off the petrification.[CR]- Stop + Regen: This makes the Regen status permanent until KO'ed.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Adamant Armor[CR]Use Alerts in the L-Shaped room in the Lunar Underground 5th floor to summon Pink Puffs. There is a 1/64 chance that they will drop a Pink Tail. Take this tail to the Adamant Grotto for Adamant, then head for the blacksmith's house, located underground, to get the Adamant Armor.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Developers Room[CR]Yes, there is a hidden Developers' Room, and it's in the hardtype version of FFIV, so here's how you get to it!  [CR]Go to the Dwarven Castle in the underworld. Get to the room where you can buy weapons and armor; there is a path in between both those counters. Walk up into the Rally-ho Pub. There, walk directly to the right (around the table of course) and you'll see an odd blackish section of floor. Walk right through the wall at that point and continue right and down the steps into the hidden Developers' Room!  [CR]There is also a hidden porn magazine in this room as well. Get into the Nap Room (from the entrance to the room, go up and right, then down into the Nap Room). Check out the left side of the bookcase nearby to find Smut, which is the magazine. Select it on the Item menu and the screen will turn purplish as Cecil looks at it... Then after it's over, the screen's back to normal and the Smut is gone.</plot>

			<title_clean>Final Fantasy IV - Easy Type</title_clean>
			<plot>In the kingdom of Baron, powerful airships rule the skies. At the head of this elite fighting force is Cecil, Captain of the Red Wings, As our adventure begins, Cecil and his squadron are ordered to steal a powerful crystal from a rival kingdom. Upon their return, Cecil questions the King's orders and is stripped of his command. To prove his loyalty, he must slay a dreadful monster and deliver a mysterious package to a neighboring town. But when the package explodes, destroying everyone, Cecil and his friend Kain vow to fight the King's dark forces. Will you be able to save the world from their evil plan to control the crystals? Get ready for the most challenging role-playing adventure ever.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 250 of a weapon![CR]OK, this glitch is a way to get 250-255 of a weapon. However, make sure you follow my directions EXACTLY how I say to, or else the trick will not work. [CR]To start the trick, you need the Avenger sword, which you can find in the Sylvan cave in the underground, I think. [CR]First, equip Cecil with arrows in his GOOD hand, and the any kind of bow in his BAD. Get into a battle (preferably an easy one), and make sure that nobody does anything. If a character's turn comes before his, have them parry (press right and the parry option will come up). Once it gets to Cecil's turn, enter the item screen. Grab the arrows he has equiped and bring them down to an empty slot. Without leaving the window, select the Avenger sword and move it up to his BAD hand. [CR]From there, press B to exit the items window and his commands will disappear because the Avenger sword causes the person with it equiped to be berserked. Don't have any other characters do ANYTHING! Just let Cecil beat up all the enemies. [CR]After the battle, go to the Equip screen for Cecil. Move the Avenger sword to an empty slot, and then without leaving the screen move the sword you would like to duplicate 250 times into his GOOD hand (the one with the numbers). De-equip, and re-equip, and voila! You should have a sword with a circle and a number next to it in your inventory. If not, make sure you followed my directions EXACTLY. [CR]This works well for duplicating the excalibur, and having Edge throw it for massive damage. Happy gaming![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 250 of a weapon![CR]This has to be done right after the battle with Golbez in the underworld, right after the battle you get Rydia back. You cast Warp and you return to the Crystal Room with the Crystal returned. Doing this makes you completely eliminate the quest of the Sealed Cave.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 250 of a weapon![CR]Once you have the Sylph spell, simply arrange Rydias spell list so that Sylph is in the top-right corner. Whenever you cast the spell, Rydia will not lose any MP. Note, though, that if Rydia does not have at least 25 MP (the normal casting cost), you will not be able to select the spell for casting.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 250 of a weapon![CR]Unlike the duplicate weapon trick, this glitch DOES NOT work in the PlayStation re-release (Final Fantasy Chronicles).[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 250 of a weapon![CR]The Mage and Bomb summon spells are very random to achive after a battle with either a bomb or mage.  Hunting them down can very time consuming especially with a low encounter rate.  A good way to enhance the chances of receiving it is with multiple kills in only one battle.  You will need a lot of phoenix downs for this.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 250 of a weapon![CR]In a battle with either a mage or bomb (there must at least be two), memorize the party's attack order.  With one member, select to kill the enemy.  The next party member should IMMEDIATELY select a phoenix down and place it on the enemy.  The result will be the enemy is killed and then resurrected by the next party member.   You may repeat this for as many phoenix downs as you have, then finish the battle.  The amount of treasure you earn will be a lot greater, and you will most likely earn a bomb or mage spell in the process.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 250 of a weapon![CR]I'm sure most of you remember that if you use weapons, armor, or accessories made out of any metal or any silver in the Dark Elf's cave.  However, there's a little glitch that can be exploited if you don't feel like using wooden gear or your bare hands to fight.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 250 of a weapon![CR]Simply put, make sure all metallic/silver equipment is unequipped before the start of any random battle.  Then when you get into battle, equip your metal weaponry(and shields, if you want) and you won't be paralyzed for that battle!  Just remember to unequip the items after the battle and before the next battle and you can dominate your way through the Dark Elf's cave!  As far as I know, this works in the Playstation and WonderSwan re-releases, too, but I know for a fact it works in the original FFII and FFIV carts.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Item Duplication[CR]Firsly make sure you have the item you want to duplicate, and enter a battle and select the item option of the person with the item you wish to duplicate. Then Scroll down to a blank space on the item list and press A to place a glove there, scroll back up to the equipped items then press A on the one you'll be duplicating, then press B to leave the screen.  [CR]Next, hold the L and R buttons to run from the battle, press X to see the subscreen, select Equip and the character who has the item, press A on empty spot the item used to occupy, then press A on the actual item that's now in the items list. You will now see that your character has two of the selected item equipped.</plot>

			<plot>The planet is dying. Cold winds blow. Fires rage. Trees are withering. In other words, it's brutal out there. Only you can stop the Dark King from consuming the light from the Crystals of Earth. But don't think it'll be a walk in the park. You're up against the sleaziest of slimebags, the evilest of ecto-scum -- we're talking serious monsters here. This isn't your basic shoot-'em-into-smithereens kiddy game, either. You'll have to think your way out of some tough spots. Think you can handle that?[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Battlefield Reset[CR]When fighting in a battlefield against an enemy that can selfdestruct, make sure all but that one enemy is dead. Also, make sure your hp is low enough for the selfdestruct to kill you as well. Wait for the enemy to selfdestruct and kill both of you. The battle will end, you will gain all the experience, gp, and even the battle count will decrease, and then it will ask you to try again. Do so and repeat the previous steps until you see that you have won the prize for defeating all the enemies. Win the next battle and exit. The battlefield icon will look like one that has been cleared out and the battlefield will now say: Battlefield Round 255 of 10.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Battlefield Reset[CR]In the menu screen, press START and SELECT at the same time.  You should then get a box telling you which version number all the chips in your SNES are.  Afterwards, the text in the menu screens might act a bit wacky.  Just exit the menu and enter it again to fix it. [CR]Weird little trick for Square to put in the game, eh?[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Battlefield Reset[CR]Usable with any battlefield that gives Experience points as a reward.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Battlefield Reset[CR]Fight in the battlefield until you have one battle left. Then, go anywhere else, and fight enemies until your experience needed for the next level is within the range that the battlefield gives. (i.e. If the battlefield gives around 200 exp. per battle, get your needed exp. to within 200.)[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Battlefield Reset[CR]Then, go back and finish the battlefield. You will gain the level with the exp. gain from the enemies, get the exp. reward, then gain another level.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Battlefield Reset[CR]This glitch will completely skip getting the fire crystal and/or getting Reuben for the first time.To start, you need your items to be in this order for consumables, Seeds, Cure Potion, Refresher and Heal Potion last. Best way to get this order set up is to get the Seed in Bone Dungeon, getting the Cure Potion right after killing the Flamerus Rex. Get the Refresher in the Ice Pyramid's first room, waiting to get the Heal Potion in the room where you get the second chest armor (It's the right chest of the bottom two.) Okay, now once you beat the Ice Golem, get the coin and make way to Fireburg and go into the Hotel.Use up the last of your seeds so none are left and talk to the npc behind the counter on the right, they sell seeds, set it to buy 0 (ZERO) seeds and accept, open your menu and you'll see the zero seeds, use one and you'll see your Cure Potions turn into the Sun Coin, the final coin to get through Doom Castle.Okay, next thing we'll want to do is talk to the person sitting at the table just to the left and up a bit, they're selling Cure Potions, you want to buy 19 and then open your menu again, actually look at your items, you'll see you've lost both coins you've collected at this point from the first two dungeons, but now, where they were, you now have the last two coins.All you have to do from here is leave fireburg, go back to the focus tower, and enter the next area.Reuben will still pop out of your ass for the little scene at the bridge, but...eh, broken game is broken.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Battlefield Reset[CR]On American versions of Final Fantasy: Mystic Quest, there is a particular glitch regarding the Life spell. Like in most Final Fantasies (and the EU/JP versions of this game), it is intended to be able to do extreme damage to undead enemies. However, a few flags got mixed up in the US versions of the game: in this version, you can use Life to kill non-undead enemies, although you can't damage undead enemies at all with this spell.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Battlefield Reset[CR]When you lose a partner and gain a new one, the new partner will retain resistances from your previous partner if you never turned off the game in between.  Stats are also affected, but do not remain exactly like the previous partner.The new partner will continue to have the incorrect stats and resistances until you restart the game.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Defeating Doom King Easily[CR]Once the battle with Doom King has begun, cast Cure on him, and you'll do massive damage to the boss. You'll do about  10,000+ to him. That's an easy win against the final boss, dont you think?[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Defeating Doom King Easily[CR]Go to any town, and if you find a treasure box, open it. Go out of town, then go back in. Open the box again and the item will be available. This can be of great help when you are stocking 99 of each item. </plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Galuf battling Gilgamesh while using the Dragoon Job.[CR]Final Fantasy V is the fifth entry in the long-running Final Fantasy series by Square-Enix, released on December 6, 1992. It follows many of the traditions of the series while experimenting with new ideas. As opposed to the previous game, which featured nearly no character customization, Final Fantasy V had an open-ended "job" system which allowed characters to be customized with different roles, and even use one role's abilities while in another one. The execution was similar to the one that Final Fantasy III had, although less rigid.[CR]Release[CR]As originally released, Final Fantasy V only came out for the Super Famicom in Japan. Due to worries from the project team that the game wouldn't be accessible to the average gamer, the translation of Final Fantasy V was shelved, and Final Fantasy VI was translated into American and European regions as "Final Fantasy III" instead. English-speaking countries did not see an official release until the PlayStation port, Final Fantasy Anthology, was released nearly seven years later, on September 30, 1999. Another version, this time ported to the Game Boy Advance, was released on November 6, 2006. It has also seen a release in Japan on Nintendo's Wii Virtual Console in January 2011 and on PSN as a PSOne Classic on April 6th. A European and North American release has been confirmed as a PSOne classic.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story begins as the winds across the worlds begin to slow, bringing ships to a halt. King Tycoon, on the back of his dragon Hiryuu, sets off to the wind shrine to investigate the matter. When the dragon arrives, the crystal shatters, stopping the wind. As this happens, a meteorite plunges into the ground near Tycoon castle, and close to the spot where Bartz and his chocobo, Boko, are relaxing. Bartz and Boko set off to investigate the meteorite, where they encounter a young girl named Lenna, under attack by some monsters. Bartz saves her, and the two investigate further. They encounter someone else at the site, an old man named Galuf. Unfortunately, his name is the only thing he remembers. As the three talk, Lenna tells them that she was traveling to the wind shrine, where her father was. Galuf realizes that he must go to the wind shrine! Of course, he doesn't know why. With that, the three of them set off for the wind shrine.The Water Crystal[CR]The meteorite proves to be quite the obstacle, requiring the trio to travel by sea. They recruit the help of pirate captain Faris Scherwiz, who takes them to the shrine. When they arrive, the situation is bleak. King Tycoon is nowhere to be seen, and the crystal is shattered. The shards of crystal magically react, and an image of the king appears. He tells them they are chosen warriors who are tasked with protecting the crystals from an ancient evil.[CR]Further research reveals that the evil King Tycoon spoke of is the great warlock Exdeath. Exdeath had once tried to destroy the world, but was sealed using the crystals. Now, these crystals were being used for their power, and it was being drained, weakening the seal on Exdeath. If Exdeath escapes and the crystals are destroyed, it would mean certain doom, unleashing a great evil and making their world uninhabitable. The four warriors now have their work cut out for them, they must save the crystals of fire, water, and earth from the fate of the wind crystal.Bartz, the main character and his chocobo Boko.[CR]Just after encountering Faris, the party notices something odd. Everyone in his crew finds him very attractive, and Bartz does too. An awkward situation. It turns out, there is reason for this: Faris is a woman! Later on, Lenna discovers that Faris is her once thought to be lost sister, the princess of Tycoon![CR]They travel to Walse, Karnak, and Carwen, and ultimately fail to save any of the crystals. Each one shatters as the team arrives, however, they harvest their power in hopes of saving the next crystal. While in Karnak, attempting to save the fire crystal, they meet Krile. Krile has come from another world, looking for Galuf, who is her grandfather! Krile is the key to Galuf's memory, and her arrival brings a flood of knowledge. Galuf is from another world, and with his new memory, he and Krile depart to their home.[CR]Bartz, Lenna, and Faris return to consult with the geniuses Cid and Mid at the library of the ancients. What should they do next? They resolve that they must travel to Galuf's world, and save it from Exdeath. Exdeath wants to destroy that world, not this one, and they feel they must help. With the help of Cid and Mid, they travel across worlds.[CR]The party arrives at Exdeath's castle, where an intense battle is taken place. The three end up as captives of Exdeath, and are locked up. Galuf comes to their rescue, and the team makes haste. They run across the big bridge, and enounter the great Gilgamesh, who vows to stop them. They take him on and defeat him, and as they escape, the castle's barrier is activated, sending them flying across the planet. Galuf reveals that he is king of Bal, a great city in this world, and was once one of the great warriors who sealed Exdeath. a shock to Bartz and the gang. They set off for Bal, and get there with Krile and her wind drake's help.[CR]Unfortunately, the wind drake is dying, and the only cure is dragon grass. The four warriors set off to find some. They meet up with an old comrade of Galuf's, one of the great warriors, Kelger. Kelger reveals to Bartz that his father, who had once left him, was one of the legendary warriors who had once fought with Galuf and Kelger. They travel further, and obtain dragon grass, and heal the drake.Boss Battle[CR]In order to progress further, the team seeks the wisdom of the great sage Ghido. Ghido had warned of the destruction of the crystals before, and could likely recommend a course of action for defeating Exdeath. Misfortune strikes, however, and when the party arrives, Ghido's island sinks into the ocean thanks to Exdeath. Still determined, they seek another way to reach Ghido. The team meets up with the other of the original four warriors, Xezat, and his navy fleet sailing to attack Exdeath. With Xezat's help, they infiltrate and take down the barrier surrounding the castle. Unfortunately, Xezat sacrifices himself in the process. They obtain a submarine, and set off for Ghido's cave.[CR]They traverse the underwater cave, and meet the old turtle sage Ghido. Ghido tells them that Exdeath was once a mage named Enuo, who had control over the void. When he was defeated, his evil was sealed in the trees of the Forest of Moore, where after 1,000 years, his evil broke the seal and was reborn into the world as the being known as Exdeath. The party then sets out to the forest to try and find something to help them destroy Exdeath.[CR]They travel to and through the forest, and reach the tree. Exdeath, bent on stopping them, shows up to spoil the party. He immobilizes them, and all hope seems lost. Krile arrives in the nick of time to save them, however, she proves no match for Exdeath. Determined, Galuf breaks free of Exdeaths spell, and takes Exdeath on head to head. Galuf fights until Exdeath retreats, when Galuf collapses. Bartz, Krile, Lenna, and Faris rush to his side, but he passes on. His spirit passesA regular random encounter[CR]on his power to Krile, who joins our warriors, now out to get Exdeath once and for all.[CR]The group heads straight for Exdeath's castle, climb up, and face him in battle. They defeat him, but it is too late. Exdeath accomplishes his goal, and two worlds - Bartz's world and Glauf's - fuse together. The group once again seeks Ghido's counsel, and he advises they collect all of the legendary weapons. The group travels far and wide, breaking the seals on the weapons, and taking each one. Once this task is completed, they head for the rift. They meet Gilgamesh one final time, who gives them his friendship. They go further into the rift, where Exdeath has gained the power of the void, and reveals his true form: a monstrous tree. He shows his true form, Neo Exdeath, and the final battle begins.[CR]Jobs[CR]The main gameplay feature that Final Fantasy V is remembered for is its open-ended "Job" system. Unlike most games in the series, each character can be assigned to perform any role the player desires, whether that be spellcaster, dual-wielding ninja, or hard to kill knight. At the start of the game, six classes, some based on classic Final Fantasy archetypes ( Black Mage, White Mage, Thief) are given to the player, and a total of 22 are gradually unlocked over the course of the game. Each of these Jobs comes with various advantages and disadvantages; spellcasters are typically weaker, but their ability to cast magic can make them very useful, while classes such as Thief are more adept at subtle advantages (like stealing from enemies) rather than sheer damage dealing.[CR]As characters gain the traditional experience levels, they also gain AP, which serve as a sort of "Job experience point" system. As a character levels up their experience in a Job, they unlock various abilities that can then be used while the character is using another class, an example being casting Black Magic while the character is a White Mage, thereby allowing one character to serve both offensive and defensive roles. Characters are limited as to how many abilities they can have equipped at once, however, requiring strategic choices by the player to get past different points in the game.[CR]A few of the character types introduced in Final Fantasy V have become staple elements of future games. The Blue Mage is the most prominent, with his ability to learn attacks that enemies have used on him being present in just about every game in the series since, and the concept of Time Mage has lived on in most games since, providing a category for spells like Slow and Haste which were previously placed with Black and White Magic, respectively.Main characters as white magesKnightMonkThiefLancerNinjaSamuraiBerserkerSorcererWhite MageBlack MageTime MageSummonerBlue MageRed MageTrainerChemistGeomancerBardDancerMime[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Disc 1Soundtrack cover art[CR]1.

Also, note that you will need the ability Throw (Ninja), as well as Steal or Mug (Thief). With the first character being a Ninja or Thief, have them be able to use Throw and Steal (or Throw and Mug). Unequip this character of whatever is in their hands; whatever is unequipped by them, or can be equipped, should then become the first (top-left) slot in the items menu. Enter a random battle where the monster(s) have items you wish to steal an infinite number of items from.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255-Item Duplication Glitch[CR]First have the Thief/Ninja from before equip the first item in your item inventory: whether it is a weapon or shield is irrelevant. Then have the character with the Throw command throw the first item in your inventory, which should be a blank. (If the initially-thrown item cannot be Thrown, such as a shield or armor, Throw this blank twice, but otherwise only do it once.) After doing so, Steal/Mug the target of Throw to steal an item, then Throw the item (if possible). After, end the battle in any desired way. In the field, return to the inventory and you'll notice that you'll have "55" (255) next to the name of the stolen weapon, or 99 if the item was non-Throwable. As long as this item is never moved from this slot - through manual sorting or the Sort command - or other copies ever bought, you can indefinitely sell this item for massive amounts of money (although you'll be selling them one at a time). And, of course, there's also the benefit of cloning unique equipment so that multiple characters can equip the same piece.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255-Item Duplication Glitch[CR]This glitch is able to occur when the two worlds of the game have merged after you go through Ghido's Cave and done the events in the Library of the Ancients. At the latter, if you use Teleport after all the cutscenes there are done, you'll find yourself at Ghido's Cave rather than the Library. This will allow you to travel around the world on Boko as you can now head towards Tycoon Castle. You can also skip the Pyramid of Moore sequence for the time being: while you do have to do it eventually, you are able to skip it for now and thereby further optimize your party.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255-Item Duplication Glitch[CR]The most important benefit, however, lies in the ability to now access the Mirage Village early to buy powerful equipment, magic, and items. In addition to the Mirage Village, you can also access a number of areas early, such as the Phoenix Tower and the Sealed Castle (where you can earn three of the legendary weapons), and also regain the Black Chocobo.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255-Item Duplication Glitch[CR]If you have a mystic knight on your party, cast Fire 3 and in the next round hit Carbuncle with it. It will not show any damage, but it will kill him.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255-Item Duplication Glitch[CR]The Mix "Kiss of Blessing" can be made with a Maiden's Kiss and a Holy Water, and in turn grants Image, Haste, and Berserk to the target. However, due to poor coding, the Berserk effect will be unblockable: this means it can affect anyone, even bosses, who are normally immune to Berserk. This in turn is highly abuseable because Berserk will force the afflicted foe's battle routines to simply "Attack", getting rid of any particularly annoying side-effects or highly powerful moves, and also make it easier for one to prevent damage by simply throwing up Protect.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255-Item Duplication Glitch[CR]However, note that it is unwise to do this in the solo battle between Galuf and Exdeath. Aside from this, any boss battle is made simpler: in fact, even the final boss battle can be skipped as you will only need to kill the first form and not the second form of the boss.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 255-Item Duplication Glitch[CR]In this game, there is a particular Blue Magic spell known as Vampire: it is essentially a Drain spell, in which you damage the target to heal your own HP. If you use it on yourself, though, you are instantly healed to full HP.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Brave Sword or Chicken Knife ?[CR]Before venturing into the Cleft of Dimension, return to the Town of Mua.In the southwest, a door that was previously locked is now open.Through the door is a hidden path that will lead you to a man.He will offer to give you a Brave Sword or a Chicken Knife.The Brave Sword will get stronger as you win battles and the Chicken Knife as you run from battles. [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Brave Sword or Chicken Knife ?[CR]In Kelb town, enter the Inn. You'll find a man sitting on a table talk to him then sit on the chair on the LEFT (NOT in front of the man)! He'll give you some kind of wine then he'll give you an after meal gift of 8 Potions! You can repeat this to get 24 potions.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Brave Sword or Chicken Knife ?[CR]Take your airship slightly south of the Town of Karnak and submerge underwater. Enter the cave you see and talk to the man inside. He claims to be a psychic and will tell you how many battles you have fought, the number of enemies you've killed, your party's average experience, the percentage of the game's treasure you have collected, and the number of times you have saved your game.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Alternate Tycoon Castle Scene[CR]In world one when you get the Hiryuu ( Dragon ) you have access to Tycoon Castle. If you go, there's a scene involving Leena and Faris where Leena suspects Faris may be her long lost sister, Sarisa, and Faris denies it. But, if you wait  until after you get the airship it's an entirley different scene involving Leena's childhood.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Alternate Tycoon Castle Scene[CR]Before the battle with Catastrophe, equip a Wall Ring on one of your characters, and cast Float on that same character.  Then, go into the battle.  Whenever one of your characters is Floating, Catastrophe will always use Gravity100 to ground that character.  However, because that character has a Wall Ring, the attack will be reflected back at him.  He will continue to use Gravity100 for the entire battle, allowing you to use any attacks you need to beat him without the fear of being killed.</plot>

			<title_clean>Final Fantasy VI</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Title screen of Final Fantasy III (US)[CR]Final Fantasy VI (originally known as Final Fantasy III in North America) is a role-playing game developed and published by Square. It was released on the Super Famicom on April 2, 1994. Six months later, on October 11, 1994, it was released as Final Fantasy III on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in North America. Final Fantasy VI was later rereleased on the Sony PlayStation (its first European release) and Game Boy Advance. The Playstation versions added load time pauses before each battle, but it is still a good game despite this flaw. Both of these rereleases were developed by TOSE and published by various publishers.[CR]Final Fantasy VI is generally considered by fans and critics alike to be one of the best console role-playing games (it has a 94% rating on GameRankings), let alone Final Fantasy games, ever made. The game was met with wide critical acclaim, being praised for its varied and complex characters, interesting story, and graphical excellence.Development[CR]Final Fantasy VI was the first Final Fantasy game to not be directed by Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, instead being co-directed by Yoshinori Katase and Hiroyuki Ito. The composer for the game was famed Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu. Yoshitaka Amano created the character design for the game, which were then converted into sprites (taking small liberties from time to time, such as changing hair color) by the graphic design team headed by Tetsuya Takahashi (head graphic designer), Hideo Minaba (background graphics), Kazuko Shibuyo (object graphics), and Tetsuya Nomura (who designed some characters).[CR]The game also utilized the Super Nintendo's unique Mode 7 capabilities. When exploring the map, the world scrolls in a pseudo-3D fashion, common to Mode 7 style graphics.LocalizationThe Japanese version's final battle screens[CR]When released in North America, Final Fantasy VI had many changes from the original version. First and most noticeable is the name change; from Final Fantasy VI to Final Fantasy III. Despite the name change, the game is now commonly referred to as Final Fantasy VI, as to avoid confusion. There were no major gameplay changes, like previous games in the series, but much of the script was changed. The game's translator, Ted Woolsey, said that the Japanese version contained much "playfulness and sexuality" that couldn't be carried over due to Nintendo of America's strict guidelines.[CR]As is common in games, most of the names changed, for a variety of different reasons. Some names were changed because they broke the six character limit (Stragus to Strago), while others were changed to seem more exotic (Tina to Terra). Since the game came out before the ESRB ( Entertainment Software Ratings Board) was a standard, many changes had to be made due to sexual or violent content. The text files had to be shortened because of the limited space in the cartridge. It took Ted Woolsey only 30 days to complete the translation all by himself.[CR]Many of the sprites in the Japanese version of the game were bordering on nudity, so these were edited. The woman form of the Chadarnook was edited to cover up more of the skin, as was the Critic, Goddess, and Siren sprites. The sprites used in the final battle also differ; the Japanese version is much larger than the American version.Other VersionsFinal Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game[CR]Final Fantasy VI has been re released in various forms on a variety of systems after its original Super Famicom/SNES release. First, there was a technical demonstration based on the original Final Fantasy VI, called Final Fantasy VI: The Interactive CG Game. In the game, players controlled Terra, Locke, and Shadow in various battles by drawing patterns with a mouse, each pattern corresponding to a different move. The game was used to demonstrate the uses of SGI ( Silicon Graphics, Inc.) and a possible graphical direction for Square's next RPG. The technology was later put to use in Final Fantasy VII.Celes Chere in a CG trailer available in the PlayStation version[CR]Final Fantasy VI was also released three separate times for PlayStation: it was included in Final Fantasy Anthology (released on October 5, 1999) and Final Fantasy Collection (released only in Japan on March 11, 1999), and was also released as a standalone title (only in Japan and PAL regions). The game was left relatively unchanged, save for the addition of CG opening and closing cutscenes, and added load times before each of the game's many randomly triggered encounters. Other notable things included were a bestiary and artwork library that were accessible from the title screen. Various other things were added, such as new opening and closing effects to battles, the option to quicksave (although all saving still had to be initiated manually), and bug fixes (as well as new bugs being created). The standalone edition of the game had a limited edition that shipped fifty-thousand copies and came with an alarm clock. Final Fantasy Anthology has an 80% rating on Metacritc and an 85% on GameRankings, gaining it the status of "generally favorable reviews."Title screen of Final Fantasy VI Advance[CR]Final Fantasy VI Advance was released on the Game Boy Advance on November 30, 2006 in Japan, February 5, 2007 in North America, and June 29, 2007 in Europe. This version is more extensively changed than the PlayStation ports, but without the load times before each of the game's many randomly triggered encounters. New gameplay features, redone graphics, and a retranslated script are among the most notable things included. Four new Espers were included in the game (Leviathan, Gilgamesh, Cactuar, and Diabolos), as well as two new locations: the Dragons' Den (which included a new boss, the Kaiser Dragon) and the Soul Shrine (in which players could battle enemies continuously). Three new spells are included in the game, and bugs from the original are fixed. A bestiary and music player are also included in the game. In addition, the boxart and game-related art has been redone as well, again by Yoshitaka Amano. One scene, in which Celes is beaten, has been removed from the game, presumably due to events in Japan at the time of release. The game was relatively well-received from both critics and fans alike; it holds a a 92% average rating on Metacritic and a 91% average on GameRankings.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]An example of the overworld[CR]The gameplay of Final Fantasy VI is similar to that of its predecessors and of other 16-bit Japanese RPGs. Player characters move about the game&#8217;s fictional setting, completing a story-fueled series of objectives: reaching a certain location, defeating a certain enemy, retrieving a certain item, solving a puzzle, figuring out what to do next, etc. The gameplay is often broken up by story and dialogue sequences, which advance the story through generally non-interactive conversations and events. Over the course of the game, the player-controlled party grows to include a handful of unique characters; this group acts as the primary perspective from which players view the unfolding plot. As they battle enemies (which are encountered at random and are unavoidable) these player characters gain EXP (experience points), which allow them to gain levels. Every time a character gains a level, his or her stats (attributes upon which combat capability depends) are raised, allowing the character to fight more powerful enemies more easily.[CR]There are four main screens in the game.[CR]In the overworld screen, the player party traverses an expansive land, moving between various locales (towns and dungeons). More parts of the overworld and more locales become accessible as the player makes progress through the game. The party is susceptible to randomly triggered battles in the overworld.[CR]Towns and dungeons are accessible from the overworld. In this screen, the player party moves about smaller-scale areas, interacting with NPCs and environmental objects. Towns generally include shops and inns, whose goods and services are bought with GP (currency). Towns are populated by numerous NPCs, with which the player can converse. Dungeons are more dangerous, as the party is vulnerable to enemy attacks while exploring them, due to randomly triggered encounters, and no shops or inns are found within. (Although Tents can be used at save points to replenish the party's health and magic, serving the same purpose as an inn.) Often contained in a dungeon is one of many powerful boss enemies, most of which must be fought in the course of the game. Dungeons are usually larger and more complexly designed than towns. Towns and dungeons are the primary settings for cutscenes and plot events.[CR]In the battle screen, the player controls the party as it fights against an enemy or enemies. The player enters the battle screen when a random or scripted battle is commenced, and exits by winning, fleeing, or losing the battle. (Losing a battle results in a game over, meaning that all the player's progress since their last save point is lost, and the player is sent back to the title screen without even being offered a chance to try that battle again). In battle, the player does not directly control character movement; instead, the player selects battle commands from menus unique to the individual party members.[CR]The menu screen is accessible from the overworld and town/dungeon screens. Here, the player can use items, manage party members&#8217; equipment and abilities, view their stats, change game settings, and save their progress. (which has to be done manually)CombatA typical battle screen.[CR]Final Fantasy VI's battles (which are most often random) utilize the Active Time Battle system first implemented in Final Fantasy IV. Each character has his or her own action gauge, which fills up at a rate dependent on the character's speed stat. When the gauge is full, the character can perform actions chosen from his or her command list. Such actions include performing a basic attack, casting a magic spell, using an item, and drawing upon the unique ability of the character.[CR]Magic, as in all Final Fantasy games, can be used for a range of purposes. Primarily, spells are used to inflict damage, bestow status conditions (both positive and negative), and heal. To cast a spell, a character must use MP, which can be restored similarly to HP. If a character's current MP is lower than the MP cost of a spell, he or she will be unable to cast it. MP, like HP, is a stat; as it rises, the character's maximum MP count will rise.[CR]As in many Final Fantasy games, the combat screen is separated into one large rectangle on top, in which all the action takes place, and one smaller one at the bottom of the screen, in which the player inputs commands. Certain non-interactive cutscenes also take place in the combat screen, with characters displayed as battle sprites.[CR]When the party wins a battle, it gains EXP, GP, and (sometimes) AP (see the "Equipment" section below). Defeated enemies sometimes also drop items or equipment.EquipmentBrowsing through items at an item store[CR]There is a lot of equipment in the game, providing for great lengths of customization. The right hand, left hand, head, and body can all be customized with a wide variety of weapons and armor. Weapons determine the nature of characters' physical attacks, while shields and armor boost their stats (primarily defense and magic defense). Generally, one hand holds a weapon, one hand holds a shield, the head holds headgear, and the body holds body armor. However, the Genji Glove and Gauntlet relics (see below) allow characters to break the rules regarding weapon-equipping.[CR]Relics are items that have effects less traditional than those of weapons and armor. Two can be equipped at once by each character, allowing them to bestow myriad potential bonus combinations. Examples of relics include the Sniper Sight (which ensures a 100% hit rate of basic attacks), the Black Belt (which grants a 50% chance of counterattacking against enemies' physical strikes), and the Alarm Earring (which prevents back attacks and pincer attacks). Relics can protect against various status conditions, bestow positive status conditions, change the nature of attacks or abilities, and boost stats. There are also relics that offer out-of-battle bonuses; for example, the Sprint Shoes double walking speed in towns and dungeons.[CR]Espers add a deep customization element to the game's magic system. Although they are not introduced particularly early in the game, they are an essential part of the game's character customization. Espers collected in their Magicite forms are the primary means by which characters learn magic spells. Each one has a unique set of spells, and each spell has a corresponding rate multiplier (a spell's multiplier usually varies between the different Espers that teach it). When a character has equipped an Esper (each character can equip one at a time), battling will further his or her learning of the Esper's spells: the number of AP (ability points) earned at the end of battle is multiplied by each spell's rate multiplier and added to the spell's growth percentage, which represents the character's learning progress. When the character's growth percentage for a spell reaches 100, he or she learns it. When the Esper is unequipped from the character, all its growth percentages (and availability of learned spells) remain; even if a percentage is lower than 100, the character can later continue adding to it by equipping another Esper (or the same Esper) with the given spell.[CR]Espers also feature as the game's summons. Each equipped Esper can be summoned once per battle to perform its unique spell; these summon spells are generally more powerful than most commonly learned magic. No AP growth is needed to perform summons.[CR]It should be noted that, due to the workings of the Magicite system, every character in the game (save Gogo and Umaro, who cannot equip Espers) can learn every spell, even though Terra and Celes are the only ones who can learn magic through leveling.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The game's story begins 1,000 years in the past during the War of the Magi. Espers had power, and men wanted that. What was necessary to obtain it was to kill the Esper and collect the remains, called Magicite. It was total war, very nearly apocalyptic in its scope. Society needed 1,000 years to return to a semblance of what it was before hand. With the Espers now in self-imposed exile, the war came to a close.Terra, Biggs, and Wedge search for an Esper during the opening credits.[CR]The game opens with Terra, an amnesiac girl aiding the Empire in searching the village of Narshe for an Esper (specifically, the Esper 'Tritoch'). After dispatching a few guards, the group comes upon the Esper. The guards approach it slowly, but Terra reacts strangely to it, killing the guards. When she awakes, she is under the care of an old man who claims to be part of a rebel group known as the Returners. He explains that Terra has been controlled by a Slave Crown, forcing her to do the Empire's bidding. He agrees to assist her, when all of the sudden, Imperial Soldiers come knocking at the door. The old man quickly tells Terra to flee, showing her the back way.[CR]The player is then introduced to Locke Cole, a cocky, self-assured thief (although he prefers 'treasure hunter'). He aids Terra in the fight against the Imperial Soldiers, as well as enlisting the help of several Moogles. After the battle, Locke vows to protect Terra no matter the cost, and proceeds to do so at the best of his ability. After assisting in protecting Terra from Imperial Soldiers, he is tasked with leading Terra to the hideout of the Returners.[CR]Along the way, the small party stops at Figaro Castle. There, they are introduced to the "ladies' man" Edgar Roni Figaro. Edgar is charming, and attempts in sweet-talking Terra, although she is unlike other women that Edgar has courted, as she seems incapable of love. Edgar is seemingly an ally with the Empire, but in reality he is an essential leader of the Returners. After being introduced to Edgar, Kefka comes in search of Terra. Kefka lies that the girl is "of no importance" to the Empire, but everyone present sees past Kefka's ploy.[CR]Edgar bravely lies, saying that Terra is not in the castle. In response, Kefka sets his castle on fire. As he is laughing manically, the party manages to escape, and then the castle dives beneath the sand (moving over to an area near Kohlingen). Kefka is humiliated and outraged, especially after the party manages to dispatch his Magitek soldiers. The party makes their way to Mt. Koltz, where Sabin Rene Figaro is introduced. Vargas (Duncan's son) attacks the party, due to the fact that he believes his father will give the fighting dojo he owns to Sabin. A brief scene plays out in which Sabin disposes of Vargas, who was intent on murdering Sabin in order to gain the dojo. After a brief reuniting "ceremony," the party sets out once again for the Returners' headquarters.The Returners' headquarters[CR]Upon reaching the Returners' headquarters, the leader, Banon, requests Terra's assistance in dethroning the Empire. The player is given the choice of whether or not to accept the offer, but either way Terra will end up aiding the Returners. After Terra accepts, a battle plan is laid out. Unfortunately, a Returner bursts and announces that the town of South Figaro has been attacked by Imperial forces. Locke goes to investigate, while the rest of the party escapes on the Lethe River. After a battle with Ultros, however, the party is separated from Sabin, whom is thrown off to an unknown destination.[CR]The player then has the choice to choose between Locke's scenario, Sabin's scenario, or Edgar and Terra's scenario. All must be chosen eventually, but the order is up to the player. In Edgar and Terra's scenario, the party merely fights their way through several enemies and eventually makes it to Narshe.[CR]In Locke's scenario, Locke is in South Figaro. The town is crawling with Imperial Soldiers, so Locke steals some clothes to impersonate a merchant. He uses this disguise to infiltrate one of the buildings that the Imperial Soldiers are using as headquarters. Here, he steals some clothes from an Imperial Soldier, and traverses throughout the house. In the back, he finds Celes, a former general for the Empire who has been infused with artificial magical abilities. She has been labeled as a traitor, although trusting her throughout the game is always risky, and is referenced constantly. She agrees to join the Returners. The two manage to make it back to Narshe as well.[CR]Sabin awakes near a house somewhere in the overworld. He meets Shadow, a ninja, whom is willing to accompany him, for a fee. They travel to the city of Doma, where they encounter an Imperial force. Kefka is there, and he impatiently wants to poison Doma's water supply as to speed up the occupation process. After General Leo leaves, Kefka follows through with his plan, despite direct orders from Leo not to go through with it. Everyone in the city except for Cyan dies. Cyan angrily leaves and begins to blindly attack at the enemies, hitting Sabin in the process. He apologizes, and the team agrees that they are there for the same reason; to dispose of the Empire. They proceed to escape by using the Magitek Armor that is in the camp (it is notable that this is the last time that the player can use Magitek Armor). After traveling for a while, the party comes upon a forest.Sabin and Cyan try to escape the Phantom Train[CR]In the forest, they find a train. Hesitantly, they aboard the train (despite the warnings from Cyan). Once on board, it is revealed that the train is the Phantom Train; it passages the dead into their next life. After much battling, the party manages to make it off the train. Cyan then witnesses his wife and son boarding. Sadly, he cries for them, and blames himself for what happened in Doma. After making it to the small town of Mobliz, the party is introduced to a young boy known as Gau. He is rather insane, as he lives in the Veldt, a strip of land inhabited only by feral animals. The party befriends him, and he gives them his "treasure," an underwater breathing apparatus. They use this to travel underwater. The party emerges in the town of Nikeah. In Nikeah, there is a port, which can take the party to Narshe. They board the boat, and manage to make it back to Narshe.The exterior of Figaro Castle[CR]After reuniting in Narshe--along with new members Cyan, Gau, and Celes--the group prepares to defend the frozen Esper encountered in the beginning of the game. After holding off the Imperial forces long enough, however, Terra transforms into a strange pink form, and flies off. The party attempts to track her down, eventually finding her in the town of Zozo.[CR]Here, she is being cared for by the Esper Ramuh, who tells them about the Espers, Magicite, and then implores them to infiltrate the Magitek Research Facility, where his friends are being tortured and drained of their power. To reach the facility, however, an airship is required. Setzer, a renowned thief, owns the only airship in the world. He has threatened to kidnap Maria, the star of an opera. Celes has an uncanny resemblance to Maria, so she poses as Maria.[CR]Setzer holds up to his promise and kidnaps "Maria," but the party comes along as well. Setzer finds this rather humorous and agrees to assist the party. After retrieving the Espers, including one named Maduin (who is Terra's father), the party returns to Zozo. The power of the Magicite that the Espers have transformed into shows Terra her past. Her mother stumbled into the Esper world long ago. One Esper took pity on her, Maduin, and the two fell in love. They had a child, Terra. Soon, however, Emperor Gestahl, Kefka, and the Imperial Forces make it into the Esper world. To wipe them out, the Espers do a magical spell to cleanse the world of any humans. Unfortunately, Terra and her mother are taken out as well. Emperor Gestahl notices Terra, and adopts her to be his warrior. After this flashback, Terra gains the ability to switch between her Esper and human forms.[CR]After reuniting with Terra, the Returners decide that it is time for a final attack against the Empire. The Returners request Terra's assistance in asking the Espers for help. Terra does so, but the human world causes the Espers to attack violently, similarly to when Terra first transformed into an Esper. The Espers completely annihilate the capitol city of the Empire, Vector. Emperor Gestahl is astounded at the destruction caused by the Espers, so he requests an alliance between the Returners and the Empire. Locke and Terra are grouped with Shadow, Celes, and General Leo as they search for the Espers to lay out the terms of peace.Emperor Gestahl makes peace with the Returners[CR]Upon arriving at the town of Thamasa, the party finds that no one has any knowledge of Espers or magic, and the village's inhabitants act very hostile towards the party. The party discovers an elderly mage, Strago, who has knowledge of the Espers and magic (although he refuses to admit it). He eventually befriends the party and reveals that the village's inhabitants are all descendants of mages that fought in the War of the Magi. He recommends that the party go get some sleep. During the night, he rushes in shouting that one of the houses is on fire, and his granddaughter, Relm, is trapped inside. The party manages to rescue her, and the two join the party to search for the Espers. Soon enough, they find the Espers, and the peace terms are laid out by General Leo (who is unaware of the evil plans of Gestahl and Kefka). This peaceful gathering is quickly interrupted by Kefka. He absorbs the power from all of the Espers, and after resistance from Leo, promptly murders him.[CR]The Returners are reunited, and by now, it is clear what Kefka and Emperor Gestahl's evil intentions are. They plan to resurrect the Floating Continent. To do so, they must go into the now open Esper world and collect the remains of the Warring Triad. They easily do so, and the island that the Esper world is located on rises into the sky: the Floating Continent.[CR]Three statues are in place on the Floating Continent that provide perfect balance for the entire world. If moved even the slightest, the world could be reshaped and destroyed. Obviously, Kefka and Gestahl have evil intent. After fighting their way to Kefka and Gestahl, the party is all knocked unconscious except for Celes (whose allegiance is shaky). Kefka offers her a sword and commands her to kill the party. She refuses, and instead stabs Kefka. Kefka is angered by this, and he begins to use the magic that the statues are granting him. Gestahl is opposed to this, but is quickly disposed of by Kefka. Kefka then moves all of the statues around, causing what is best described as the end of the world.[CR]Fortunately, the game does not end there. The second part of the game, the World of Ruin, begins with Celes awaking from a year-long coma. After awakening, she finds herself on an island under the care of Cid, who has become a fatherly figure to her. Cid reveals to Celes that he has become gravely ill and at that moment, the game leaves his fate in the player's hands. The player can choose to have Celes nurse Cid back to good health by catching and feeding him "yummy" or regular fish. Conversely, Cid can die by feeding him rotten fish or if Celes does not tend to his illness. If Cid dies, Celes will find a raft that he built so she could sail to freedom, but not before attempting suicide (which is referenced more in the Japanese version of the game). If Cid lives, he will show Celes the raft he was building and give it to her so she can leave the island. Regardless of whether Cid lives or dies, Celes will eventually set out to find all of her friends.[CR]The World of Ruin is mostly non-linear (as opposed to the World of Balance), and after acquiring a certain amount of required party members, the player can proceed to Kefka's Tower, where he rules with an iron fist. Each character has a unique story during the World of Ruin, and while some are optional, it is definitely interesting to see where they have gone. In addition, each character has an optional side-quest that maximizes their power. Optional characters Umaro and Gogo and be obtained during the World of Ruin as well. After destroying the three statues housed inside, the party makes their way to Kefka. He has drained the Warring Triad of their power, so now he has godlike strength. He launches into a monologue, enraged that the world can still cling to hope, citing the World of Ruin as a reason why the party should just give up hope. After each of the party's members gives a personal example of why he or she still has hope, the final battle begins.[CR]After the destruction of Kefka, it is revealed that all the Magicite that was in him helped keep magic in power. Destroying Kefka means the end of magic, meaning the potential destruction of Terra. As Terra helps the party escape in her Esper form, her father comes and tells her that if she can cling onto her human side, she may survive. The airship Falcon manages to catch her as she falls, and she survives: a human. The world is saved, Kefka has been defeated. A montage of clips from various portions of the world plays, showing how the citizens are rebuilding the world after the horror of Kefka's reign.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]All of the playable characters except for Shadow and Gau[CR]Fourteen characters are fully playable in the game. They range from a little girl with a talent for painting to a full-grown yeti. While the plot initially forces the player to use certain characters at certain times, later sections of the game leave party creation largely to the player. Dialogue at certain plot points is entirely dependent on the player's chosen party composition. In this way, the game takes a significant step towards a more rewarding role-playing experience.[CR]Each character has a back story significant to his or her development, if not to the main plot. The depth of the cast is commonly praised as a highlight of the game, and some character subplots are arguably more compelling than the main storyline. In the World of Ruin section, most characters have optional side-stories that delve into their histories and their psyches more deeply than the main story. For instance, in Cyan's side-quest, the party explores his subconsciousness, eventually freeing him from a captor demon. He meets the ghosts of his wife and child, and they encourage him to not hold himself responsible for the events that transpired in Doma. Each of these side-quests addresses a previously touched-upon attribute (personality trait, life event, etc.) of its central character.Terra BranfordTerra Branford[CR]Terra (Tina in the Japanese version) is a girl with mysterious origins whom the player are first introduced to in the beginning of the game. She is with a group of Imperial Soldiers as they search the town of Narshe for an Esper, which appears to have been recently uncovered in the mines of Narshe. The soldiers Terra is with discuss where she came from and one mentions that she makes him uncomfortable. The soldiers (and Terra) are in a powerful suit known as Magitek Armor that gives the wearer incredible defense, strength, stamina, health, and even powerful magic attacks. After the group finds the Esper, Terra reacts strangely to it and the group of soldiers with her disappear.[CR]Later in the game, it is revealed that Terra is the daughter of an Esper named Maduin and a human mother named Madonna. Madonna somehow ended up in the Esper realm and Maduin fell in love with her. When Imperial Soldiers attempt to invade the Esper realm, Madonna and her baby girl are sucked back into the human realm, where Terra is raised by Emperor Gestahl. She is said to have destroyed fifty Imperial Soldiers in one exercise, so Gestahl controls her through an item called the Slave Crown (which is later removed by The Returners).[CR]In the World of Ruin, Terra is found in the town of Mobliz, caring for all of the children who lost their parents when the Light of Judgment obliterated their town. Terra fears that she isn't powerful enough anymore, but when she annihilates a monster that comes to destroy the children, she gains courage and encourages the children to live for hope. She then joins the party to keep Kefka from causing the world anymore pain.[CR]At one point in the game, Terra learns her special ability: Morph. This allows her to transform into an Esper and boosts her magic and physical attack. Her Esper form is a glowing pink figure with long hair. She can switch back and forth between it.Locke ColeLocke Cole[CR]Locke (Lock in the Japanese version) is a young thief. However, whenever he is referred to as a thief--be it by a close friend or a stranger--he becomes enraged and claims that he is a 'treasure hunter.' His special ability is Steal, which allows him to take items from certain enemies. A Relic, the Thief Glove, can turn this attack into Capture, in which Locke attacks and steals at the same time. In the beginning of the game, Locke vows to protect both Terra and Celes, and attempts to keep that promise at the best of his ability.[CR]Locke was in love with a girl from Kohlingen named Rachel, who normally accompanied him on his treasure hunts. On one hunt, Rachel fell and suffered an injury that caused amnesia. She forgot that she loved Locke, but he stays anyway. He is eventually too heartbroken to stay any longer, so he leaves. During his absence, the Empire attacks, and Rachel is killed. Her father says that her final words were Locke's name. Locke is so hard on himself that he searches far and wide for a way to bring her back to life. He finds a Magicite known as Phoenix that is supposed to heal people from the dead. Since it is damaged, the effects are temporary, but Rachel tells Locke not to be too hard on himself, and that she loves him.Cyan GaramondeCyan Garamonde[CR]Cyan (Cayenne in the Japanese version) is a loyal servant of the king of Doma. Cyan's special ability is SwdTech (short for 'Sword Technique'), a powerful attack that has eight levels (that must be upgraded by doing various things). The eight levels are selected via a time bar that slowly goes across the numbers. The SwdTech attacks do a variety of things, from multiple hits with Cyan's sword, to a one hit kill. Cyan typically speaks in Old English, saying things such as "thou art" or "sayeth." This trait is poked fun at constantly throughout the game.[CR]When Kefka poisons Doma's water supply, everyone close to Cyan perishes (including his wife, Elaine, and his son, Owain). Angry at the Empire, he joins the Returners, where he later meets Gau, his best friend. In the World of Ruin, Cyan takes pity on a girl whose boyfriend isn't responding to her letters (due to his death), so he lives on top of Mount Zozo, writing letters to her.ShadowShadow[CR]Shadow (real name Clyde) is a mysterious mercenary and assassin who would supposedly "slit his mama's throat for a nickel." He appears frequently throughout the game, and plays an important role during the climax of the game. He is always accompanied by his dog, Interceptor, who is a "merciless killer" as well (although Interceptor takes a liking to Relm). Shadow's special attack is Throw, in which he can throw a wide variety of items at the enemy for varying amounts of damage. Occasionally, Interceptor will also counterattack the enemy.[CR]Shadow appears a few times during the first half of the game, sometimes offering services (for a fee of course). During the climax, he stays behind to help save the world, and if the player stays with him, Shadow can be found in the Cave in the Veldt, where he will join the party permanently.[CR]A little can be found out about Shadow through dream sequences by sleeping with him in the party at an Inn. He was originally a thief named Clyde, who traveled with friend and fellow thief Baram. During a heist of one million GP, Baram gets injured and requests that Clyde kills him. Clyde runs, leaving him to an uncertain fate. He them settles down in Thamasa with a woman named Madonna, where he has a daughter (hinted to be Relm). He eventually leaves and adopts the name Shadow.Edgar Roni FigaroEdgar Roni Figaro[CR]Edgar is the king of Figaro and an important member of the Returners. He likes to think of himself as a lady's man, but most of the time he comes across as being more immature than actually having a chance with women. He is the older brother of Sabin. Edgar's special ability is Tools, which allows him to use Tools found in the adventure, such as a Drill that causes an amount of damage, or a Debilitator which causes a certain magical weakness in the enemy.[CR]When Edgar's father died, neither Sabin nor Edgar wanted to inherit the crown, so they decided to flip for it. In one of the most famous scenes in the game, Edgar flips a coin, and it is decided that he will inherit the crown. Later in the game (when Celes uses the same coin to trick Setzer into letting the party use his airship), it is revealed that he nobly used a double-sided coin so that his brother wouldn't have to rule Figaro.[CR]In the World of Ruin, Edgar disguises himself as a thief named Gerad, and keeps the disguise until he breaks into Figaro Castle. He then reveals that he is Edgar, and fights alongside the party.Sabin Rene FigaroSabin Rene Figaro[CR]Sabin (Mash in the Japanese version) is the aforementioned younger brother of Edgar Roni Figaro. He left his inheritance to the throne to train in martial arts under a man named Duncan. Sabin's special ability is Blitz. When selected, a control code must be inputted to do a certain attack. For example right, left, right would be the control code for the move Pummel. Sabin can learn more Blitzes throughout the game, which are increasingly complex.[CR]Sabin wins the coin toss with Edgar (the one that Edgar rigged with a double-sided coin), so he leaves his inheritance and trains under a world famous Duncan Harcourt. Duncan's son, Vargas, becomes jealous when he realizes that Sabin is superior in martial arts, and that Duncan might leave the dojo to him. Vargas attempts to murder Sabin, and then escapes to Mount Koltz, where he is defeated by Sabin. He then proceeds to reunite with Edgar, and join the party.[CR]In the World of Ruin, Sabin is found in Tzen, holding up a building to keep the child inside from burning alive. After rescuing the child from inside, Sabin will join the party. However, if the time runs out, then Sabin is permanently dead.Celes ChereCeles Chere[CR]Celes is a Magitek Knight, in that she is genetically fused with magic from birth. Her special ability, Runic, allows her to absorb the next magic attack and turn it into magic points. She is one of the only other playable characters that can learn traditional magic without the aid of Espers.[CR]Celes is one of two Imperial Generals (the other being Leo). She is accused of treason, and then tortured. After being rescued by Locke, she decides to join the Returners. Throughout the game, her loyalty is questioned constantly, but it remains true that she is on the same side with the Returners. She proves this when Kefka gives her a sword to attack the party with, but instead she attacks Kefka.[CR]During the World of Ruin, she awakens from a year long coma under the care of Cid. Whether Cid lives or dies, she will leave the island with a raft provided by him and begins her search for all of her friends. She is the first character to be introduced during the World of Ruin.Strago MagusStrago Magus[CR]Strago (Stragus in the Japanese version) is an old wizard living in the village of Thamasa. His special ability is Lore. He can learn attacks from enemies that the party has fought before, and then use them in battle. Not every spell can be learned in Lore, however. Strago is a descendant of the Mage Warriors, hence his natural magic abilities. His ancestors fought in the War of the Magi. Apparently, Relm is not Strago's actual granddaughter, but a 'friend's daughter.' It is hinted at during Shadow's flashbacks that he is the actual father of Relm.[CR]After talking to Strago in Thamasa, everyone in the town becomes more friendly. The innkeeper lowers the price to sleep there from 1000GP to 1GP. Despite Strago denying any connection to magic or the Espers, it is eventually revealed that he indeed can use magic and has a knowledge of Espers. During the night, he asks the party to save his granddaughter, Relm, from a burning building. After rescuing her, Strago will join the party, and eventually Relm will as well.[CR]In the World of Ruin, Strago is first found in the Cult of Kefka. If Relm is in the party, however, he snaps out of his trance, and joins the party. Upon returning to Thamasa, one of Strago's friends fakes and injury and claims that it came from the beast Hidon, a monster that Strago spent almost his entire life chasing. His curiosity renewed, he goes to search again. After finding and defeated Hidon, Strago is the happiest he's ever been, and Relm thanks his friend for it.Relm ArrownyRelm Arrowny[CR]Relm is a ten year old (although she is much smarter than an average ten year old) from Thamasa. She is an incredible artist, causing her special ability to be Sketch, in which she paints a picture of the enemy that the attack is used on, and then using its own attack back on it. If the Relic Fake Mustache is attached to Relm, Sketch is replaced with Control, which allows the player to control the enemy that the attack is used on. It is hinted throughout the game that Shadow is Relm's actual father.[CR]After Strago joins the player's party, Relm feels left out and follows the party into the Esper Cave. She helps out by sketching Ultros, and showing him that he actually is an ugly octopus. During the World of Ruin Relm can be found in one of two places. She can be found in the Cave in the Veldt if Shadow wasn't rescued, or she can be found in the mansion of Owzer, where she is being forced to paint. The painting she is making is possessed by a demon, and the party has to defeat it to get Relm back in the party.Setzer GabbianiSetzer Gabbiani[CR]Setzer is an infamous gambler who appears to be an enemy character at first, but then turns out to be benign. His special attack is Slot, in which Setzer uses a slot machine to choose from a variety of attacks. If the Relic Coin Toss is equipped to him, Slot is replaced with GP Rain, in which he throws coins at the enemies.[CR]When Setzer is first introduced, he announces that he plans to kidnap Maria, an opera singer who is going to star in the performance &#8220;The Dream Oath: Maria and the Draco.&#8221; Celes then agrees to impersonate Maria, since she is her exact double. After being captured by Setzer, she bets her hand in marriage in trade for the use of Setzer's airship, the Blackjack. She uses the same double-sided coin that Edgar used to lose to his brother. Amused that he was beaten at his own game, Setzer joins the party and agrees to help the Returners.[CR]In the World of Ruin, the Blackjack has been destroyed. Depressed, Setzer is found in a cafe. The party convinces him to join by showing their hope that the world will go back to normal. Setzer then uncovers the location of the Falcon, the only other airship in the world that belonged to his deceased friend Daryl.GauGau[CR]Gau is a unique character that is found living among the animals in the Veldt. His special ability is a combination of two commands: Leap and Rage. After leaping, he will learn a skill from the monster that is being fought. By using Rage, a monster can be selected, and its attack will be used. Leap can only be used in the Veldt, but Rage can be used anywhere. Gau's father is an insane old man living by the Lethe River. Gau's mother died, and Gau's father thought that Gau was possessed by demons, so he left the baby in the Veldt.[CR]Gau is first found living in the Veldt. After encountering him, Gau takes a liking to Cyan (and makes fun of his old English accent). To gain his trust, he must be fed Dried Meat. Gau guides the party to a helmet that can be used to breath underwater.[CR]In the World of Ruin, Gau can again be found in the Veldt, but only three or less characters can be in the party.MogMog[CR]Mog is a moogle who, unlike other moogles, can speak English. He lives in the caves of Narshe along with the rest of the moogles. His special ability is Dance, which changes the background and uses one of four attacks randomly. Mog is somewhat like the &#8220;mascot&#8221; of the game, as he appears on most of the merchandise in relation to the game.[CR]Mog is first seen when he helps Locke fight off the Narshe Guard while Locke escapes with Terra. When Mog joins the party, he is kidnapped by a mercenary named Lone Wolf, who gives the player a choice between a treasure that Lone Wolf offers, or Mog. Mog can be found in the Caves of Narshe in the World of Ruin.[CR]While Mog is the only moogle that can join the party on a permanent basis, many of his moogle friends are playable in battle during an early part of the game.[CR]Optional/Secret Characters[CR]GogoGogo[CR]Gogo is a mysterious person whose gender is unknown. Gogo is completely hidden from view by the brightly colored clothes that Gogo wears. Gogo's special (and only) ability is Mimic, in which Gogo uses the same attack that the previous character used.[CR]Gogo can only be found in the belly of a monster called the Zone Eater in the World of Ruin. After making it all the way to Gogo, Gogo finds the party worthy and agrees to join.UmaroUmaro[CR]Umaro is a yeti who resides in the mines of Narshe. Like Gogo, Umaro is completely optional. Umaro always has the status of Berserk, so he can't be controlled by the player. He can't be equipped with any items besides Relics. Umaro's only attack (unless Relics are attached) is a powerful physical attack.[CR]Umaro is found in the mines of Narshe in the World of Ruin when Mog recommends that they should seek his aid. Once Umaro is found, he must be fought, and the Mog will reprimand him for attacking the party and demand that he joins the party.[CR]Other Notable Characters[CR]In addition to the aforementioned playable characters, many other important characters play integral roles throughout the game. These non-playable characters (NPCs) are essential to the story's progression, and the game in a whole. The characters below are the most important, story-wise, to the game.KefkaKefka[CR]Kefka (he is Cefca Palazzo in the Japanese version) is the main antagonist of the game. One of the most notorious of all the Final Fantasy villains; he isn&#8217;t a living incarnation of sin, or a supreme god-like being come to plunge the world into utter darkness. He is just an evil, evil man; one part coward, one part clown, one part mage, and one part nihilistic megalomaniac bent on world domination. His infamous cackle is one of the first things verbally spoken in a Final Fantasy game.[CR]Kefka was born and immediately abandoned. He was raised in a Thamasa orphanage in which he was beaten often by the orphanage head. He developed a cold, quiet personality due to his early experiences. Kefka eventually migrated to Vector and entered the Imperial academy where he graduated at the top of his class. Cid immediately recognized his talents and took him on as an apprentice, putting him in prime position to be the first volunteer for the Magitek Knight program. He was genetically fused with magic through an imperfect program, but for years showed no signs of it affecting his sanity whatsoever.[CR]He went on to become incredibly successful within the Empire, taking command of the Magitek Knights at only 23 years of age. It was then that he met Celes Chere, an orphaned citizen of Tzen, and took a liking to her. Celes became his apprentice and he pulled several strings to ensure that she became a Magitek Knight herself. Kefka's imperial career peaked at age 31 when he was made Imperial Prime Minister, a position second only to Emperor Gestahl himself. Kefka gained fame as a brilliant tactician and strategic savant. It was at this time that Kefka's sanity began to deteriorate, most likely due to imperfections in the original magic-infusing process he underwent from Cid.[CR]At a banquet celebrating Celes' promotion to Rear Admiral, Kefka finally cracked with a violent outburst, and slid quickly into insanity afterward. Once shy and taciturn, Kefka began dressing in garish clown costumes and wearing makeup. Memories of his teenage and adult life began to fade away, leaving only his horrid childhood. Thus he became more cruel and more hateful and eventually developed a bloodlust and an obsession with destruction. Gestahl noticed this and removed him from the military.[CR]However, Gestahl was still thankful to Kefka for his years of service beyond expectation and stellar military record, so Kefka was placed at the position of Court Mage. His former position was filled by General Leo, which sparked Kefka's intense jealousy and hatred of the man which culminates during the events of the game. Kefka's reputation among imperial soldiers is on display in the camp outside Doma castle during Sabin's scenario. He has a reputation as a coward, yet many of the imperial soldiers still fear him due to his being prone to wild fits of rage and violence.[CR]Kefka is responsible for many of the game's events. He is the one who demands that a Slave Crown be put on Terra's head. He also is responsible for the poisoning of Doma's water supply; after General Leo takes too long to formulate an attack plan, Kefka decides to take matters into his own hands and poisons the water. He is also at the Magitek Research Facility, where he physically and mentally abuses Espers to suck them dry of their power. In a ploy later in the game, Emperor Gestahl puts Kefka in prison, claiming that his poisoning of Doma was unnecessary and cruel. After it is revealed to be an evil Imperial plot, Kefka comes to Thamasa where he turns the congregated Espers into Magicite.[CR]Using that power, Kefka and Emperor Gestahl revive the Floating Continent, where statues that keep the world in balance reside. After the party reaches him, he freezes them all (except Celes) with power that he is getting from the statues. He then orders her to stab the party, and gives her a sword. Refusing, she stabs him instead. Kefka is annoyed and enraged, but not fatally wounded. He orders the statues to kill them all. Gestahl, afraid that Kefka is going to upset the gentle balance of the statues, shouts at him to stop. Kefka refuses, and then kills Gestahl and merely kicks his body off the edge of the Floating Continent. He then moves all of the statues around, reshaping the World of Balance into the World of Ruin.[CR]In the World of Ruin, Kefka is technically the "god" of the land. He rules with an iron fist from atop his perch in Kefka's Tower. If so little as one person opposes him, he destroys their entire town with the "Light of Judgment." The effects of this are seen in several places, especially in Tzen and Mobliz. Followers of his have joined a cult called the Cult of Kefka. Members walk around mindlessly, and one villager says that there is no hope for them. However, Strago is seen with them, and he can be revived.[CR]After reaching the top of Kefka's Tower, Kefka can't believe that the party can have so much hope in such a ruined world. They all use examples from their personal lives (and quests in the game). This angers Kefka, and he takes on his god form, which has several stages with multiple forms in each stage. After defeating him, the end of magic in the world is witnessed. Terra, being part Esper, was believed to be one of the casualties at first, but then she lands on the airship, alive and well.Emperor GestahlEmperor Gestahl[CR]Gestahl (he is Gastra in the Japanese version) is the ruler of the Empire. Gestahl has ruled the Empire ever since its beginning, and is obsessed with harnessing magical energy for aid in his military conquest. He once managed to infiltrate the Esper home world, but was quickly ejected from it (along with Terra and her mother). When the Espers realize that he is attempting to come into their home again, they break free of the gate, and--being unable to control their power at first--they completely obliterate the capital city of Vector. Amazed at their power, the Empire lay down their arms, and Kefka is thrown in jail for his crimes. It is, however, merely a ploy to get into the Esper home world. General Leo, the most noble general of the Empire, is kept out of the secret, however, so when he tries to protect the Espers, he is killed by Kefka.[CR]Gestahl underestimates Kefka's own insanity, and ends up being murdered when he tries to stop him. He is shamed by Kefka when his dead body is disrespectfully knocked off the Floating Continent.Cid Del Norte MarguezCid Del Norte Marguez[CR]Cid is a recurring character in the Final Fantasy franchise. In this particular game, he is the head researcher of the Empire. His work led to several inventions, including Magitek Armor. He is referred to as a grandfather figure to Celes several times in the game, and when she joins the Returners, he begins having doubts about Emperor Gestahl and Kefka's plans. He helps the party by warning them about a trap in Vector and by helping them escape the Magitek Research Facility.[CR]After the World of Balance is destroyed, Cid (and many others, including Celes) is stranded on a small island. It is subtly referenced that the others all committed suicide by jumping off a large cliff on the island (and Celes attempts to as well, once Cid dies). He cares for Celes for a year while she is in a coma, falling ill while he does so. Once Celes awakens, he dies, but not before revealing a raft that Celes can use to escape the island.General Leo Sharret CristopheGeneral Leo[CR]General Leo is one of the two head Imperial Generals (the other being Celes). Leo is more noble than other Imperial leaders, such as Kefka and Gestahl. He was assigned to capture Doma, but when he had to leave, Kefka took over and poisoned the water. He later apologizes to the only remaining survivor, Cyan. During the fake peace treaty between the Empire and the Returners, the fact that it isn't true is kept away from Leo. When the Espers meet to negotiate peace, he does the talking, and convinces them to have peace.[CR]After Kefka reveals the plan as being fake, Leo bravely defends the Espers and the party. However, Kefka quickly destroys him using the powerful magic that he absorbed from the already dead Espers.[CR]General Leo was subject to a famous rumor in the '90s. Much like Aerith Gainsborough of Final Fantasy VII, many fans claimed that there was indeed a way to bring Leo back from the demise he fell to at Kefka's hands. These were, however, proven incorrect as it is now confirmed that there is no way to bring back the fan favorite in the World of Ruin aside from altering the game's code.UltrosUltros[CR]Ultros (he is Othros in the Japanese version) is a purple talking octopus who appears at many times during the game. He is a humorous boss character who seems to be a comic relief character. He has a friend named Chupon who is also fought occasionally.[CR]In the World of Balance he is fought four times. He is first encountered on the Lethe River, where he spouts out many of the catchphrases he is famous for. In the World of Ruin, he ends up owing too much money to the owner of the Colosseum. He works as a receptionist for the Colosseum, and his friend Chupon works as a monster when no other monster will fight.BanonBanon[CR]Banon (Bannan in the Japanese version) is the leader of the Returners, a rather large group of rebels who are determined to overthrow the corrupt Empire. He is playable for a small part of the game (when the party is on the Lethe River). His special ability is Health, which heals the entire party without using any magic points. After the destruction of the World of Balance, he is not encountered again.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]The music of Final Fantasy VI was written by Nobuo Uematsu, who was well-known for his work in previous Final Fantasy games. He composed a theme song for every playable character. In addition to these themes, the soundtrack contains a traditional battle theme, multiple boss fight themes, songs for special events, and songs for several of the towns and other locales. A few tracks exceed ten minutes; these include "Dancing Mad", the seventeen minute-long final boss theme, and the "Ending Theme", which combines all of the individual character theme songs.[CR]One of the game's most famous songs is "Aria di Mezzo Carattere", a song that is played during the well-known opera scene. The sound chip of the SNES (SPC700 format sound chip) didn't allow for actual voice, so Uematsu created a synthesized voice that sang in rhythm to the song. Later in the SNES' life, some developers figured out how to do actual voice, however. In Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale, "Aria di Mezzo Carattere" is sung in Italian by Svetla Krasteva.[CR]There were many albums of Final Fantasy VI's music released. The original soundtrack was released on three discs in both North America (as Final Fantasy III: Kefka's Domain) and Japan (as Final Fantasy VI: Original Sound Version). Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale was an album that contained orchestral arrangements of Final Fantasy VI's music. Piano Collections: Final Fantasy VI featured music from the game preformed on piano by Reiko Nomura. Final Fantasy VI Special Tracks was an album that consisted of unused songs or remixed music. In addition, many of Final Fantasy VI's songs have been adapted by other bands (such as Nobuo Uematsu's own band The Black Mages, and the band Machinae Supremacy).Final Fantasy VI: Original Sound VersionFinal Fantasy VI: Original Sound VersionOmen (4:15)The Mines of Narshe (2:48)Awakening (1:41)Locke's Theme (2:01)Battle (1:59)Victory Fanfare (0:39)Edgar and Sabin's Theme (2:32)Kefka (2:43)Mt.

This will last until the character is healed by some means, such as a Potion or Cure in the field. There are several ways in which to do this.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]The most feasible method of doing so requires the use of Doom and Jump. When a character afflicted by Doom has Jump, have them use Jump as their Doom counter nears zero. If the counter reaches zero while the character is in the air, and after that point but before the execution of the actual Jump attack the battle ends, then the character will be invulnerable.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]Another feasible method requires the use of the Zombie and Petrified statuses and cures for these. When a party member is Zombified, they should then be Petrified. Then you should cure their Zombification through a Holy Water and their Petrification through any desired means. This will also induce the glitch.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]This glitch will allow you to obtain the Blackjack at an early point in the game, should you so desire. To execute this glitch, you must first save the game in the overworld at the first possible opportunity: this point (which can be shifted, but is ideally done early) is the point in the game where you'll have the Blackjack. From this point on, you must play the game without saving until you reach the Floating Continent: at this point, you must travel along it until you can get onto the Blackjack. Get on it and fly around for a while in it without landing - 10 minutes is sufficient - and then return to the Floating Continent. There, get a Game Over.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]You will then restart gameplay from the point of the initial save, with one key change: you are aboard the Blackjack! Several features will be restricted to you, such as entering the interior and re-entering the airship after landing it. This has a number of benefits despite this. For example, you can fly to an area in the game to skip all events up to that point (Zozo being the latest allowed). You can also bring temporary characters - such as Leo or Banon - to other, early points in the game by flying.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]Put Gau and Relm in the same party.  Have Gau jump on an opponent.  Fight until he comes back, but before he does his little speech, have Relm sketch him. If your game is glitchable, then there is a chance at switched up character sprites and/or many items added to inventory after the battle.  I recieved 255 MagicBoxes and 255 Atmas Weapons this way the 5th time I did it.  (Note this only works on the early carts.  Will not work on all carts.)[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]Equip Celes with a Cursed Shield. If she absorbs (with runic)a spell the shield makes her weak against (fire is what i used) she gets back double the mp of the spell.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]When fighting the Wrexsoul in Cyan's dreams at Doma in the World of Ruin, there is a glitch involving his Gi Nattak attack. In this attack, the Wrexsoul will possess one of your four characters for a time until he kills them. If, in that time, you defeat all of the enemies allying him, you will automatically win the battle despite not having killed Wrexsoul himself. (Note: You will not gain any of the rewards normally associated with Wrexsoul's defeat.)[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]To execute this glitch, you must put Reraise on an undead enemy: this can be done through Rippler to trade Reraise from someone, at least most reliably. Then you must use  an instant-death attack or spell on the same foe: the foe will die, then return to life, and then die again because Reraise auto-revived it and Life is Death for the undead. This causes the game to consider that the foe was killed twice, doubling the received rewards.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]To begin with, sell everything that the intended character you wish to put something on can equip. Next, put the desired "equip anything" item in the final bottom-rightmost slot of the items menu, slot #256. This item can be literally ANYTHING you want, even things that cannot be equipped, such as the Drill item. After doing this, press Optimize and the item will stay there and can be equipped by the person with no equipment in any particular area of their equipment. For example, the aforementioned Drill can be taken on as a helmet. Depending on the item, a huge variety of stat changes can occur: once again, the Drill actually makes your Defense and Magic Defense go to 255, meaning almost every attack only deals 1 damage![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]Normally, two pieces of equipment - the Force Shield and Cursed Shield - are supposed to grant status ailments in battle. The Cursed Shield is the one you'll want to most use with this glitch, since it only grants bad ailments, whereas the Force Shield grants the positive one in Shell. If you equip the Cursed Shield in the middle of battle - not before, DURING - you will instead be granted immunity to all of the ailments it gives, which is most of the ailments in the game![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]On all versions of the SNES cartridge, the evade% stat has no effect.  [CR]All algorithms use MBlock% to calculate dodging/blocking an attack, magical or physical. [CR]128% is where MBlock% is maxed at effectiveness (higher isn't worse, it just isn't any more effective) [CR]Therefore, equip your characters to 128 MBlock% or higher and you'll be nearly invincible (block or dodge any unblockable attack.)[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]Let us assume you have a tile you wish to bypass: this tile can be a tile which triggers an event - such as a boss - or you simply a wall you wish to walk through. If you open the menu and quickly press the direction in which you desire to move as it loads, you can walk in the direction chosen,  but the game's hit detection will fail, allowing you to walk into and through walls with repeated use and to also bypass various event battles.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]The most famous instance of this glitch is known to many fans as the "Moghan glitch", in which Locke is able to bypass the guards in South Figaro and head to South Figaro Cave without Celes and in turn instead have Moghan. However, this glitch is also abusable in a number of other instances.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]When you have Vanish and Relm, go into battle, have one other character cast vanish on a desired opponent then have Relm Sketch that opponent and QUICKLY run away, check your items and voila! *Note, may not work on all carts. 1/1000 chance of freezing the game.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]Normally, Jump is only intended to double the damage earned from spear-class weapons; however, this can be extended to any weapon so long as the wielder can hold two weapons. If you equip two weapons, one of whom is a spear, the second weapon's damage also is doubled by Jump. Other exploits can be derived from Jump's accumulation of active weapons' properties; for example, if someone uses Mug while someone is Jumping, all Jumps from there on will also have the effects of Mug.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]Typically during a pincer battle - a battle in which enemies are on both sides of the party - there is supposed to be only one singular row, rather than the front and back row. Despite this, you can still select the Row option in battle: everyone will initially be in the front row, and now in the back row, quickly halving the damage each take, even though there was no true position change.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]To prevent Organyx from breaking, you can put it in a character's right hand, then also equip them with the Dragoon Boots but without the Dragon Horn. The sword will now never break because it was encoded improperly for this situation, where it is meant to check the left hand here.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]In a battle, have Cyan use Retort, then cast Imp on him. Then use an attack that kills him without triggering Retort, such as magic, or killing him in one hit. Now revive him and use the Fight command with anyone. Cyan will counterattack every move that is made, including his own. In other words, Cyan will attack his enemies over and over again, uninterrupted, until they are all dead.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 0 HP Character Glitch[CR]First start by getting one of your groups onto a save point.  Now cycle through the groups until you arrive back at the one on the save point.  Switch groups one more time and go to the party screen and the "Save" command should be useable (and you can even use Tents!).  Even after walking around and getting into a battle, the Save command should still be available.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Easy Level Ups[CR]Note: you must have a turbo controller to do this trick[CR]&lt;br/&gt;When you make it to the Lete River, set your window commands to "Short" and switch Banon's "Health" and "Attack" then switch the commands back to "Window" so you can have Banon's Health as the default command.  When you get to a point where you have a choice of going "Straight" or Left set your controller to turbo and tape down the A button.  Leave your game on overnight and you will likely be around level 50-60.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Easy Level Ups[CR]First you need the Vanish spell and the Doom spell. (X-Zone could also work) Cast Vanish on the enemy and then cast Doom on the vanished target. This also works on about 95% of bosses![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Easy Level Ups[CR]As the world is collapsing on the Floating Continent, and you have six minutes to get off, make your way to the very end where you can jump down to the airship. Instead of jumping, wait and do not move. When there is five seconds left on the clock Shadow will appear and jump down to the airship with you instead of dying. [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Easy Level Ups[CR]When you're supposed to catch some fish for Cid, be sure to catch the fast ones that moves around in the water and give those to Cid so he can live. If you catch the slow ones and feed them to Cid, he'll die because the slow ones are the sick fish and the fast ones are the healthy ones.</plot>

			<title_clean>Fire Emblem - Monshou no Nazo</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Fire Emblem: Monshou no Nazo is the third game in the Fire Emblem series and the first released on the Super Famicom on January 21, 1994. The game is comprised of both a remake of the original Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ryu to Hikari no Tsurugi and a sequel storyline that once again focuses on Prince Marth of Altea. Monshou no Nazo was released on the Japanese Virtual Console in December of 2006. In 2010, a remake of Monshou no Nazo was released in Japan for the Nintendo DS. Unlike Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon, the DS remake of the first game, Shin Monshou no Nazo was never released outside of Japan.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Monshou no Nazo begins with a truncated retelling of the original game's story.[CR]The first part of the game, Book One, retells the story of Fire Emblem: Ankoku Ryu to Hikari no Tsurugi. However, the story is condensed, and so not all of the events and characters that appeared in the original Famicom release appear in this version. The first game's DS remake, Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon, retells the original game's story in its entirety.[CR]In Book Two, Hardin, prince of Aurelis and ally of Marth in the original storyline, ascends to the throne. Hardin's military begins to occupy neighboring countries by force, and Marth and his army are used to conquer smaller countries under orders of General Lang. Marth soon discovers that the forces of darkness are at work again, corrupting Lang and Hardin, and that Medeus is still alive. Marth retrieves the Fire Emblem once again (this time from Linde, who was entrusted with it by Princess Nyna), and embarks on a quest to retrieve the twelve shards of the Star Orb in order to revive it. Branded a traitor by King Hardin, Marth and his forces are hunted down all the way to the desert of Khadein. There, Marth learns that a depressed Hardin was manipulated by Gharnef and only the Light Orb can save him. Marth journeys through the icy mountains to obtain the Light Orb, required to defeat and free Hardin.[CR]With the Light Orb, Marth and his allies stage a final assault on Archanea to liberate Altea and save Hardin and Elice. Though he is able to rescue Elice, Hardin cannot be saved, and he dies. Following Hardin's death, the location of Medeus and Gharnef is revealed. After defeating Gharnef for the final time, Marth confronts Medeus, who has now taken the form of a dark dragon.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As a partial remake of the original Fire Emblem, Monshou no Nazo introduces a number of gameplay elements that weren't present in Ankoku Ryu to Hikari no Tsurugi. For example, mounted units such as cavaliers and pegasus knights could dismount and move on foot. Book Two also introduces Zodiac items that are scattered around the continent. Characters in possession of Zodiac items at the time they level up experience altered stat growth depending on which item they have equipped.[CR]Anime Adaptation[CR]Monshou no Nazo was adapted into a two-episode anime that spans the earliest chapters of the game. The plot chronicles Marth's escape from Altea, his defense of Talys from pirates, and the rescue of the cleric Lena from mountain bandits. The anime was published on VHS in North America by the distributor ADV under the title Fire Emblem in both English dubbed and subtitled formats.[CR]		</plot>

			<title_clean>Fire Emblem - Seisen no Keifu</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu (Genealogy of the Holy War) is the fourth installment in the Fire Emblem franchise, the second to be produced for the Nintendo Super Famicom and was released only in Japan on May 14th, 1996. It was later released on the Japanese Virtual Console service on the Wii in January of 2007. It was followed by Fire Emblem: Thracia 776, which is chronologically set during a gap in time in the middle of Seisen no Keifu's story.[CR]Seisen no Keifu was one of the last games produced by Nintendo to be credited to Gunpei Yokoi, who resigned from the company after the failure of the Virtual Boy.[CR][B]Storyline:[/B][CR]Seisen no Keifu adopts the usual narration style used in the precedent titles, with the difference that the time from one chapter to the other is much larger than usual. In fact, sometimes, when reaching a new part of the story line, the player learns that several years have passed since his last mission.[CR]The title has an extremely large and intricate storyline, even by Fire Emblem standards. This is one of the reasons for the title's fame and fortune. The storyline is, in fact, particularly tragic, and the characters portrayed easily inspire sympathy and compassionate feelings, especially in the case of Sigurd.[CR]The prologue of Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu begins with Prince Kult, the son of King Azmur of Barhara Castle, making the decision for the Grandbellian army to subdue the Kingdom of Isaac, in response to an invasion of Darna by barbarians of Rivough, Isaac. This is an unforeseen occurrence because the kingdoms of Grandbell and Isaac have been peacefully getting along with each other for many, many years. Lord Sigurd (or Siglud) of Chalphy remains in Chalphy castle while his father Byron (or Vylon) is away. He believes he has nothing to fear, because there are no invasions or threats from the other countries in the continent of Jugdral; unfortunately, Sigurd's assumption is proved incorrect. Prince Gandolf of Marpha, Verdane, and his army invade Grandbell, seizing Jungby Castle, the closest castle to the Grandbell-Verdane boundary. Noblewoman Aideen (Adean), alongside only a few knights that stay at the castle to protect her at Jungby Castle. The Jungby knights are crushingly defeated by Gandolf and his army, except for Mideel (Midayle), the strongest of all Jungby archers, who (despite his skill) is defeated by Gandolf himself. Shortly thereafter, Gandolf leaves Grandbell for Verdane and takes Aideen as his hostage.[CR]Sigurd is informed about what has just happened at Jungby and decides to gather the remaining Chalphy knights(Noish, Alec, and Arden) to travel to the Kingdom of Verdane to rescue Edin. While on the road to Jungby Castle, Sigurd is joined first by Azel of Velthomer, who sneaks out of Barhara Castle and drags Lex of Dozel into joining Sigurd, and then his sister Ethlin, her husband (Sigurd's brother-in-law and best friend) Cuan from Lenster, and their loyal and most valuable knight, Fin. Sigurd first met Cuan at the Royal Academy of Barhara, alongside Eltshan. Cuan says that he is always with Sigurd, especially in times of war. Noish and Alec go to where Azel and Lex are and help them save the villages north of Jungby. All together, they battle Demagio, who Gandolf leaves to guard Jungby, and easily retake the castle.[CR]In Jungby Castle, Sigurd finds Mideel alive and recuperating. He tries to make Mideel rest, but instead, Mideel joins Sigurd's conquest to rescue Edin. Alvis of Velthomer walks over to Sigurd, who is now on the road to Evans Castle in Verdane, and gives him the Silver Sword from King Azmur. He also tells Sigurd to look after his half-brother Azel. In Evans Castle, Mideel defeats Gerald with his arrows, but Aideen is not in the castle. Lord Filat, King Azmur's messenger, arrives to Evans Castle to inform that Sigurd has been entitled "Holy Knight of Grandbell." With strengthened pride and honor, Sigurd goes deeper into the Kingdom of Verdane.[CR]Sometime later, Edin, whom Sigurd and Oifey fail to find in Jungby Castle, is taken by Gandolf of Marpha to Marpha Castle in southern Verdane. King Bator was a pacifist, until Sandima arrived. Until he took the throne of Verdane, the Kingdom of Verdane was a nightmarish land, filled with chaos. He brought peace, order, and freedom to Verdane and it seemed likely to last for many years with his three sons: Gandolf, Kinbois, and Jamka. Matters degenerate after a mysterious magician, Sandima, shows up. Sandima's influence largely causes King Bator to order Grandbell's invasion of Verdane, and he grows more and more aggressive. Gandolf and Kinbois lose heart and do whatever Sandima wishes, but Jamka, alone, does not give into Sandima's influence. The Verdanian people become aware of the loss of peace and the kingdom, engulfed in the flames of war, wishes to have its pacifist king back.[CR]Sigurd and his forces reside in Evans Castle, the most northeastern castle of Verdane, bordering the Kingdoms of Grandbell to the east, Verdane, and Agustria the Lords' Dominion to the west, but officially located in Verdane. King of Eltosian (Eltshan) of Nodion, the castle west of Evans, comes to meet with Lord Sigurd to ask him why he is present in Verdane. Sigurd say that the Verdanian army took Aideen hostage with no signs of releasing her and that he was forced to take up arms. After Sigurd speaks with Eltosian, Eltosian says that he will watch and protect Evans Castle from Agustrian raids. Therefore, Sigurd and his forces leave for Genoa Castle to the south of Evans, feeling that Nodion's army will protect them.[CR]Meanwhile, in Marpha Castle, located west of Genoa Castle, Gandolf and Jamka stay in the castle with their hostage Aideen. However, Jamka falls in love with Aideen behind Gandolf's back and decides to free her, to Aideen's surprise. He sends her out of Marpha castle with Dew the thief, who he caught some days before this chapter of the game. Dew agrees with Jamka to protect Aideen until she reaches safety. They flee from Marpha Castle and head to Evans Castle together, through the deep Verdanian forests. Along the way, they meet Sigurd and Mideel, and decide to join their army. But immediately after they flee Marpha Castle, Gandolf finds out that Edin is missing from Marpha Castle and sends the Marpha army to capture her and Dew. A division of Sigurd's army that is not heading for Genoa easily crushes this army.[CR]Meanwhile, in Genoa Castle, at the approximately the same time, Kinbois feels threatened by Sigurd's army. He decides to attack Sigurd's army himself. He is so afraid to leave his castle empty that he forces Ayra, a mercenary whom he just hired (after she fled from her native country, the Kingdom of Isaac, to escape Isaac's conflict with Grandbell), to guard Genoa Castle. Ayra is not too willing to do so, but Kinbois threatens to kill Ayra's young fraternal nephew, Shanan, if she shirks her duty. Therefore, she is forced to do as Kinbois wishes and begins to fight against her will. However, she threatens him back, saying that she will kill him should he double-cross her. Kinbois and the Genoa army then go after Sigurd's army.[CR]After a reunion with Aideen, Sigurd's army crushes both the Marpha and Genoa armies. They go south to Genoa, where they meet Ayra, who fights Sigurd's army alongside the remaining Genoa axe fighters. While his army holds off Ayra, Sigurd immediately enters Genoa Castle to rescue Shanan. He takes Shanan with him and talks to Ayra. Ayra sees that Kinbois is in the grave and that there is no more to fear. She reciprocates Sigurd's trust and (tentatively) decides to join Sigurd's army for rescuing Shanan. Shortly thereafter, Cuan apologizes to Ayra and discusses with her the political situation between the Kingdoms of Isaac and Grandbell. Cuan's father King Lenster has a high opinion of Ayra's father King Mananan, who was assassinated by Lord Reptor on the Grandbellian fronts. At the time, Mananan is journeying to Barhara to explain to Prince Kult about the situation with Rivough.[CR]Meanwhile, right as King Eltosian of Nodion expects, Eliot of Heirhein and his army attempts to seize Evans Castle. The board guard informs Eltosian of Eliot's invasion. Eltosian argues with Heirhein, telling Eliot that he is running in direct violation of the Agustrian ruler's orders. Despite this, Eliot still attempts to invade Evans. Eltosian and his army of powerful Cross Knights crush Eliot's army, sending him back to Heirhein. Feeling like Nodion Castle may soon be in further danger, Eltosian and his army leave Evans and return to Nodion.[CR]Sigurd continues to travel deep south into the Verdane and enters Marpha castle, where Aideen was held hostage. Gandolf is present at Marpha to fight Sigurd, but only a handful of soldiers are remaining at the castle. Therefore, the capture of Marpha is quick. Prince Jamka is not present at the time of the subjugation, and Aideen believes that he came to the city of Verdane to convince his father Bator to seek peace for Verdane. As Sigurd walks around Marpha city, he meets a beautiful young maiden named Diadora, who knows his name. She says to him that she was held hostage by Gandolf and had spoken to Aideen. At first sight, Sigurd loses his heart to Diadora, but Diadora leaves before he is able to ask her name. An old man steps in and informs Sigurd that she is a maiden of the Spirit Forest, and that she is actually forbidden to associate with anyone outside the forest. He also says that the villagers believe that any man from outside the forest that comes too close to her will be greatly cursed. However, Sigurd does not believe in the legends of the Spirit Forest and he attempts to reunite with her, regardless of the curse.[CR]Meanwhile, Prince Jamka is in Verdane Castle to speak with his father Bator about making a peace treaty with Grandbell. His father, still under Sandima's curse, refuses to listen to Prince Jamka. Sandima orders Jamka to depart from Verdane Castle immediately with the remainder of the castle's army and attack Sigurd's army. Jamka reluctantly accepts Sandima's orders. As soon as he exits Verdane Castle, Sandima assassinates King Bator, rendering him useless. Manfroy, Sandima's mystical leader and the head of the Loput Sect, shows up and tells Sandima to attempt to clean up the mess in the Kingdom of Verdane. He also asks Sandima if he has found Cigyun's daughter, whom he needs in order to resurrect the Dark Lord Loputousu. Sandima says that he is still searching for her. Cigyun's son Alvis is already found, but they need the daughter.[CR]Prince Jamka is still unhappy about attacking Sigurd's army, because he knows that is not what his father really wants. However, at the battlefield in the forest, he reunites with Aideen, who tells him that Sigurd did not come to Verdane to invade the country, but that he merely came to rescue her. She convinces him that he should listen to his own emotions and do what he believes best. Shortly thereafter, Jamka joins Sigurd's army.[CR]As Sigurd's army continues their way to Verdane Castle, they traverse a deep forest. Near the north end, Sigurd meets Diadora, whom he saw at Marpha Castle. She says that she attempted to forget that they ever met each other, but that could only make her more miserable. Sigurd says he requites her love, and that he does not believe in the forest legends, and that he desires to marry her at Evans Castle. Diadora joins Sigurd's army as they continue to go northward to Verdane Castle.[CR]Sandima can use a lethal, long range dark spell called "Fenrir." However, Diadora casts Silence on Sandima, rendering his spell useless and victory easy. As Sigurd subjugates the castle, they find the near-death King Bator. For his last words, King Bator says to Sigurd that the evil that is spreading across the continent of Jugdral is the work of the Loput Sect, a dark sect that is bent on destroy everything that is good and on accelerating the resurrection of the Dark Lord Loputousu. After this, he dies in Sigurd's arms. Sigurd and his army then go back to Evans Castle, where he marries Diadora.[CR]King Imuka is mysteriously assassinated. Sigurd receives orders from Barhara to take possession of Evans Castle. Months later, Eltosian goes to Agusty Castle to tell King Chagall how cruel war is and how burdensome it is on the citizenry. Chagall shortly casts Eltosian into the Agusty dungeon, accusing him of making him a fool. Then Manfroy arrives, telling him what is needed to resurrect the Dark Lord Loputousu: the children of Cigyun.[CR]Meanwhile, in Nodion, Lachesis and her guardian Eve receive word that Eltosian was imprisoned in Agusty. Eltshan leaves three cross paladins to protect his sister Lachesis. One of the paladins says that if Heirhein army finds out that Eltosian is apprehended, they will attack Nodion immediately. In Anphony Castle, Macbeth believes that they have a free reign now that Chagall has taken the throne. He is excited Heirhein army has taken up arms, and he then deploys thieves to strip the villages in the central Agustria forest near Mackilly Castle of all of their valuables and destroy them.[CR]In Evans Castle, Sigurd receives word that Eltosian is captured, and tells Diadora that he is heading for Nodion to save Eltosian. Diadora wants to fight alongside him, and promises that she will not leave his side. A division of Heirhein army, led by Boldor and his son Elliot, attacks Nodion and attempts to capture Lachesis. However, Sigurd and his army rescue and recruit Lachesis. Sigurd tells Lachesis that King Azmur approves of Grandbellian invasion of Agustria and that Azmur is aware of the assassination of King Imuka, as well as Chagall's plans invade Grandbell. Sigurd's army then moves on to kill the remainder of the Heirhein army, including Boldor's henchman: Phillip. Sigurd ultimately conquers Heirhein. Chagall goes to Anphony and informs Macbeth about this, saying that Macbeth's avarice costs him Heirhein. Meanwhile, Levin and Sylvia receive word that Macbeth sent bandits to destroy the villages in the central villages. Levin intervenes to fight the bandits, saving the villages, as Sylvia dances to guide him in this mission.[CR]Shortly after Sigurd conquers Anphony, Filat arrives to Anphony and tells Sigurd about the rumors going around in the Royal Court of Barhara. Rumors include that Sigurd, Cuan, and Eltosian are conspiring against Prince Kult of Barhara, and that Sigurd hiding Shanan the Prince of Isaac proves this. Filat tells about the late Victor, the Duke of Velthomer, father of Alvis and Azel, and notable philanderer.[CR]At Mackily Castle, a dark mage announces the assassination of Prince Kult, part of Manfroy's plan to find Cigyun's children. Chagall deceives Ferry to seize Evans Castle. Ferry and her squad go en route to Evans Castle, but Levin arrives ther firste. Levin talks with Ferry and convinces her to join Sigurd's army. Ferry was to come to Agustria to take Levin back to Silesia, but she wants to stay with Sigurd instead. Sigurd's army then heads to Mackily Castle and stops the army of mercenaries, archers, and mages.[CR]At Agusty Castle, after Sigurd subdues Mackily Castle, Chagall sends Zain and his army after Sigurd's. Lachesis then tells Chagall that he is not her king and then wounds him with her lances. However, Eltosian puts Chagall in medical attention and Chagall recovers, only to know that it comes out to be a mistake. Six months later, the leadership that they have been trusted with is broken all too soon. Eltosian and his cross knights are stationed in Silvail Castle. The Orgahil pirates start to raid the villages near Madino Castle. At Agusty Castle, Seliph is born. This time, Diadora cannot leave the castle, and Shanan watches the two. By the end of the battle, Sigurd seizes Madino and to meets Claud of Edda and Tiltyu of Freege. Claud suspects that Sigurd's father Byron is accused of assassinating Prince Kult. Meanwhile, Diadora leaves Agusty Castle to meet Sigurd, leaving Seliph in Shanan's care. Before she can reach Sigurd at Madino Castle, Manfroy appears before her eyes. Manfroy then wipes Diadora's mind, captures her, and leaves her for Alvis to find in order to resurrect the Dark Lord Loputousu.[CR]Chagall forces Eltosian to fight against his will and betray Sigurd. He leads the Silvail cross-knight army against Sigurd's army. Lachesis comes to Eltosian and convinces him that betrayal is not the way of a knight. Eltosian returns to Silvail, but he is publicly decapitated by the Silvail guardsmen under Chagall's orders. Trabant arrives at Silvail, Chagall having hired the Thracian army to wipe out Sigurd's. However, the mercenaries fail and Trabant flees the country, leaving Chagall to be defeated once and for all. Shortly after Sigurd conquers Silvail, Prince Shanan, carrying baby Seliph, comes to Sigurd at Silvail and informs him of Diadora's fate. At Madino, Ethlin gives Cuan the Gaeborg. Brigid joins Sigurd's army, and flees from pirates until a division of Sigurd's army fights them off. Aideen meets Brigid for the first time since childhood and gives Brigid the Holy Bow Ichaival after revealing to her her true identity. Claude speaks with Sigurd and tells him that King Mananan, father of Ayra and grandfather of her nephew Prince Shanan, was assassinated by none other than Tiltyu's father Duke Reptor when journeying to tell the truth about the siege on Darna. After Sigurd conquers Orgahil, Langobalt and his army march to Agusty Castle, and Sigurd is deemed a traitor to Grandbell. Ferry's sister Mahnya arrives at Orgahill to take Sigurd and his army to Silesia.[CR]Sigurd and his army arrive with Mahnya to Silesia, a country covered with snow. They arrive at Sailane Castle. Ferry and Levin are suspicious of the skirmish there, as Silesia is engulfed in war. Cuan, Ethlin, and Fin leave Sigurd and return to their home kingdom Manster. Levin's uncles Maios and Daccar protest the idea of him ascending to the Silesian throne, throwing the country into civil war. A Loput sectarian marches with a wind mage brigade, while Deet'var travels with her pegasus knight brigade.[CR]Soon after conquering Thove castle and killing Maios, Daccar, another one of Levin's uncles, summons Pamela to launch an attack onto Silesia Castle and hold its Queen as a hostage. However, Mahnya, the older sister of Ferry, gathers her brigade to counter-attack the upcoming attack from Pamela. Andorey, the brother of Aideen and Brigid and the father of Scorpio, comes with his army of archer knight to kill Mahnya and her pegasus knights. Sigurd's army can do nothing to prevent Mahnya's death. Silesia Castle is soon taken over by Daccar. Andorey and his army go back to Grandbell. Queen Rahna orders the people of Silesia Castle town to flee to the mountains near Sailane. After Sigurd retakes Silesia Castle from Daccar, Levin talks with his mother Rahna and obtains the holy scroll Holsety. Meanwhile, Daccar hires an all-female mercenary group led by Swordmaster Reimia to take down Sigurd.[CR]Things are getting worse and worse for Sigurd and his friends, so he decides that it is time to finish all. He and others, now in Zaxon castle, go stop Langobalt, Lex's father, and the other remaining Dukes from going through with their conspiracy. Vylon has traveled there, too, in order to give Sigurd the Holy weapon of Baldo, the Tyrfing, before dying. Shortly after, Langobalt falls and Sigurd conquers Lubeck Castle. Shanan and Oifey flee with Seliph, along with several other children of the army, to Tilnanogue in the northern country of Isaac. Ayra informs Sigurd that she has finished fulfilling her promise to her late brother Mariccle, and she plans to stay with Sigurd (at least until the Battle of Barhara).[CR]Meanwhile, Cuan and Ethlin return form Lenster to aid Sigurd in his cause. Unfortunately, the Thracian Dragon Knights followed them, and even with the Gaeborg in Cuan's hands, they inevitably die. After this event, Trabant takes Altenna and the Gaeborg and returns to Thracia. The other members of the Thracian army are slain by Sigurd's army. After he conquers Phinora, Sigurd hears news about the deaths of Cuan and Ethlin. Afterward, his army ventures across the Yied Desert. Reptor's army waits for Sigurd, not moving until his army is close enough to attack. Once they do, however, the Velthomer army turns against Reptor. Once Reptor is defeated, then the battle is over.[CR]Alvis summons Sigurd and his army to perform an assumed victory celebration. However, the Battle of Barhara (aka the Barhara Massacre or the Barhara Incident) commences. The casualties in the Barhara Incident are unclear. The event is discussed in Fire Emblem: Thracia 776, and that game confirms some of the survivors; Aideen, Bridget, Fury, Lachesis, Tiltyu, and Sylvia survived. Aideen retires to Tilnagogue Castle sanctuary and conducts church services. It is rumored that Bridget becomes Eyvel. Fury returns to Silesia, but by the time of Seliph's tale, she dies of natural causes. Lachesis sends her daughter Nanna to Fin in Lenster. She is heading to Isaac in search of her son Delmud, but she can not stand the heat of Yied Desert and dies there. Tiltyu flees to Silesia and gives birth to Tinny, Arthur's younger sister, and gives them both necklaces. She suffers from post-traumatic stress after the Barhara Incident. She eventually returns to Freege and starts crying everyday, unable to withstand the loss of her friends, losing contact with her son Arthur, and enduring abuses from Hilda. Her mind and body can no longer withstand it, and she dies of illness. Sylvia survives the Barhara Incident, but her whereabouts are unknown. Ayra's case involving the Barhara Incident is very unclear and highly debated. She is presumed dead during the game ending. However, many Japanese sources differ on her case, and many Fire Emblem fans believe that she is actually still alive and that she retired to the Isaacian countryside, tilling her father's fields.[CR]The death of Sigurd, along with the discovery of Diadora bearing Narga blood, act as catalysts that transform Alvis into Emperor. He successfully creats a peaceful regime in Grandbell that lasts for 17 years. He also has two twin children, Julius (Yurius) and Julia (Yuria), from Diadora. However, after 17 years of peace, things started to change. With the resurrection of the Loput Church, the Grandbellian Empire becomes an authoritarian regime, the people living in total oppression. The ruler of Issac, King Danan, is talking to his general Harold about a group of rebels. Harold says that he has found the rebels hideout and has sent an army to capture and execute them. Meanwhile, at the rebel's hideout, Skasaher (Ayra's son) sees the army and rushes inside to tell his twin sister, Lakche. Lakche wants to fight the army but Skasaha is hesitant to fight. Seliph comes in and says that Skasaher does want to fight; he's just worried about Seliph. Seliph says not worry and the three prepare to go to battle. The priestess Rana wants to come too, but Seliph tells her to stay here. However, he changes his mind when he sees how much she wants to come. Shortly after the battle begins, Oifey, Delmud, and Lester arrive and join Seliph's cause.[CR]Upon conquering Ganeishire, the group finds Levin and Princess Julia. Levin leaves Julia with Seliph and his companions to attend other matters, while Kinga Danan orders his sons Johan and his younger brother Johalva to attack. Neither of them really want to attack because Lackche fights alongside the rebels. Eventually, Lakche convinces one of the brothers to join. Almost immediately after conquering Ganeishire, Ferry's daughter Phee, a pegasus knight, and Arthur, a mage and son of Tiltyu arrive near Sophara. Phee set out looking for her brother, Sety and Arthur left to look for his sister Tinny. They both decide to join the rebels and help their cause. The group marches on to defeat King Danan in Rivough. Danan is the son of Langobalt, meaning he inherited Major Neir blood. His first son, Brian, also holds this blood, allowing him to use the Holy Axe Swanchinka. After defeating Danan, the rebels march on to look for their leader, Prince Shanan.[CR]After Seliph liberates the Kingdom of Isaac from Danan's reign, they begin to cross the Yied Desert from Rivough Castle. Meanwhile, Fin, Leaf, and Anna defend nearby Lenster. Phee flies into Lenster to help them out, while Seliph, Lakche, and Skasaher meet with Shanan, who, along with Patty, joins Seliph's liberation army. Patty infiltrates Yied Shrine and seizes the Balmunk, which was transferred from Isaac Castle after the Isaacian-Grandbellian War, and gives it to Shanan.[CR]After Seliph reclaims Chalphy, he has to face the other Dukedoms of Grandbell, along with Price Julius and Archbishop Manfroy. Meanwhile, Julius finds out that Alvis was killed and Manfroy explains that he would have turned against him anyway and that he is no use of them. Julius then talks to his sister Julia, who says that she misses her brother and that the introduction of the Loputousu book changed Julius. Julius then gives her to Manfroy and goes to each of the Dukedoms to tell them to get ready to face Seliph's army. During the battles, Levin explains to Seliph that Julius is the reincarnation of the Dark Lord Loputousu and that he is planning on reviving the Loput Empire. He also gives background information of how the dark Empire had started and who Loputousu really is.[CR]Seliph prepares to take action on the Dukedom of Edda first. He faces the Grauen Ritter along with Brian of Dozel, who swears to avenge his father. However, Seliph's army eventually defeats him. When Seliph captures Dozel, Levin tells him about who the gods are and how the 12 crusaders were created, along with information and history about the last Holy War. He also explains to Seliph that Julia is his younger half-sister and that she was the one who inherited the blood of Narga from Empress Diadora.[CR]After Seliph conquers Dozel, he is caught in an ambush between the Gelben Ritter (led by the sinister Queen Hilda of Freege) and the Beigen Ritter (led by Andorey's son, Scorpio of Jungby). When Seliph defeats Hilda's army, he meets someone by the name of Felipe who explains to him that he was an attendant of Emperor Alvis and that he was ordered to protect the children from the child hunts. He also explains that Princess Ishtar volunteered to help out with the children secretly. Seliph is surprised by this and that he was told that Ishtar is a caring person and helped the children escape from the start. Seliph then asks Levin where Julia is. He thinks that she is either in Velthomer or Barhara and that Seliph will have to get her himself. After Seliph captures the House of Freege, Ishtar tells Julius to have her send the Weissen Ritter after Seliph. Julius is not too pleased about Ishtar's idea however. She explains that she wants to do it for the pride of the Freege family and avenging their deaths. Although Julius is not sure about Ishtar sending her troops, he lets her go and tells her that he is not forcing her to do anything. Meanwhile, Manfroy sends a possessed Julia after Seliph's army.[CR]When marching toward the capital city of Barhara, Seliph has to deal with the Weissen Ritter (led by Princess Ishtar), Barhara (guarded by the Dark Prince Julius along with the 12 Dark Warlords), Ishtar's army, Julia and Velthomer (guarded by the evil Archbishop Manfroy of the Loput. Sect). Eventually a small army of the Thracian Dragon Knights, led by Prince Arion, gets involved within the final battle. Altenna meets up with him and tries to convince him that what he is doing is not the right way to go. He eventually agrees, not for Seliph, but for his (adopted) sister. Meanwhile, Ishtar sends the Weissen Ritter, along with a trio of difficult-to-defeat Falcon Knights to attack Seliph's army. After they are all defeated, Seliph then faces Ishtar. Tinny is upset that she has to face Ishtar because she is a cousin who has been so kind to her. In the end, though, Seliph's army defeats Ishtar.[CR]Seliph then encounters a possessed Julia, seeing that she is placed under a spell by Manfroy. Levin explains to Seliph that they should go and kill Manfroy first and then try to talk to Julia. Seliph finally encounters the wicked Archbishop Manfroy, who explains that the spell he placed on Julia was the same as the one placed on Diadora and that everything was all part of his sinister plot to resurrect the Dark Lord Loputousu. Seliph blames Manfroy for causing grief and sadness to his parents so that he could succeed in his evil ambitions in resurrecting the dark lord. Seliph kills Manfroy and brings Julia back to her senses. When Seliph captures Velthomer, he, along with Levin, learn from Felipe that Alvis had the light tome of Narga locked up to keep Manfroy and the Loput. Sect. from getting their hands it. They learn that the only way for it to be unlocked is to use the Diadora's Circlet that Alvis gave to Julia to protect her from Julius. Julia feels so much power when using and feels that she has a strong relationship with her mother.[CR]Seliph and Julia rush back to Barhara to face Julius in the final battle. Seliph is unable to defeat Julius alone due to the effect of the dark tome of Loputousu, which severely weakens most warriors. However, with the help of Julia's Narga tome, they defeat Julius and the evil within him. The battle between the dragon of darkness and the dragon of light seems to take forever, but Seliph and Julia manage to defeat Julius and release Loputousu from his body. Loputousu's last words are that Narga has ruined everything for him. He appears in the form of a black dragon after Julius is killed and eventually disappears from the world. Seliph then successfully takes the throne of Barhara, becoming the emperor of Grandbell, with Julia by his side.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Building upon the basic gameplay of the games that preceded it, Seisen no Keifu introduced a long list of innovations, many of which became standards for the entries that followed. Some of these improvements are listed below.[CR]Arguably the most important new feature introduced is a robust character relationship system that affects both elements of the gameplay and story. Playable characters can converse with each other in the middle of the battlefield, possibly forming strong relationships or even falling in love with each other. Characters with strong bonds also raise each other's stats when fighting together on the battlefield. For example, if one character attacks an enemy while close to his/her lover, the character has a much higher chance of landing a critical hit, which deals three times the normal damage.[CR]As an additional feature, characters of opposite sex who had fallen in love during the first half of the game could generate children that became playable characters in the second part of the story, taking characteristics such as stats and growth rates from both parents. Given its heavy tie to the storyline, this feature was dropped in subsequent titles in the series. Later games used the Support System, a system that carried the same ideas that the Love System started. However, Fire Emblem: Awakening brings back the marriage concept, as it too features a storyline that makes it possible to play as a second generation of characters descended from the original cast.[CR]Seisen no Keifu is also the first game in the series to feature the Weapon Triangle System, an important strategy concept that gives each weapon a Rock-Paper-Scissors like property. The game similarly introduced the trinity of magic among Fire, Wind, and Thunder magics seen later in Path of Radiance and again in Radiant Dawn.[CR]However, some ideas presented in this game were not used in future entries. When characters fight in the arena, they do not die (as they do in other games), but rather lose the match and go back to battle with one hit point remaining. Also, weapons can be repaired, with more powerful weapons requiring more gold to repair. Each character also carries their own gold supply, as opposed to the use of a more standard collective pool of gold from which all characters could draw.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Lackche with Balmunk[CR]First, you need Lackche to have major Odo blood by pairing with Holyn, or she will not be able to wield it. To start the glitch, equip Shanon with the Balmunk, and get killed. Have Corple use the Valkyrie Staff, and press L or R on Shanon. Shanon's Balmunk should change to an Iron Lance. Now Save your game, and reset. Load your game back up, and go to the Shop in your castle. Balmunk should be for sale. Now have Lackche buy it. Normally she wouldn't be able to buy it, but if you did the above steps it should work. </plot>

			<title_clean>Fire Emblem - Thracia 776</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Fire Emblem: Thracia 776 is the fifth official installment in the Fire Emblem franchise and is the third and final title in the series to be released on the Super Famicom, only in Japan. On August 28th, 1999, the game was made available with the purchase of a special DX version. It was then released through the Nintendo Power download service on September 1st, 1999. It was finally released in a classic cartridge form on January 21st, 2000, making it one of the very last Super Famicom games ever produced. The game was a relatively bold success both critically and in sales.[CR]The game is considered a midquel of Fire Emblem: Seisen no Keifu because the plot unfolds between Chapters 5 and 6 in the precedent game's storyline. Consequentially, many characters from Seisen no Keifu appear in the game and many are playable, such as Leif and Finn.[CR][B]Storyline:[/B][CR]Thracia 776's story unfolds in the middle of Seisen no Keifu's story, making it parallel to the past game's events. Prince Leif of Lenster, having been hidden from the Grandbell Empire for most of his life by his father's loyal knight Finn, finally decides to take a stand and raise an army after his childhood friends Nanna and Mareeta are captured by the empire. From that point, he raises an army to regain his homeland. The events at the end of the game directly tie into Chapter 6 of Seisen no Keifu.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Thracia 776 brought back concepts from Monshou no Nazo, such as smaller scale battlefields and the ability of cavalry to dismount while inside buildings. However, it also retained the skill system from Seisen no Keifu and brought many of its own mechanics into play, most of which have since been implemented in later Fire Emblem games. These include Fog of War maps, which impeded the player's vision range and could be temporarily ailed with the torch item, as well as secret chapters unlocked under certain conditions. All of these maps were fog of war and often contained useful characters or items not present otherwise.[CR]Thracia 776 also introduced a "Capture" command, which allowed characters to take enemy units in order to obtain items, which were often needed due to the lack of funds in order to buy weapons from stores and a "Rescue" system, which allowed units to load characters with less build and rescue them in a similar manner to capturing. While both brought interesting new strategies to the game, only the former survived and now exists in all Fire Emblem titles from that point with the exception of Shadow Dragon.[CR]The game is the only one in the series to feature the fatigue meter, a bar which was tied to each character and raised each time he or she entered battle. Once filled, that character was not allowed to participate in the next mission, forcing the player to differentiate the units they brought into combat as well as avoid unnecessary conflict. An item is available in the game that helps alleviate fatigue, but is prohibitively expensive.[CR]Thracia 776 is infamous for its sadistic difficulty, even among fans of the series. This difficulty mostly stems from a combination of the Fatigue system, relatively high enemy troop strength, relatively weak allied unit strength, as well as certain chapters that rush multiple groups of enemy troops at the player simultaneously. Ironically, the final boss of the game is considered to be laughably weak, which can be considered one mercy in an otherwise brutal game.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Transferring Gold from a save file to a new file[CR]Load a save file. Enter battle, then when at the map screen, open the map menu and select Suspend to suspend your game, then press Start to return to the Title Screen. After that, start a new game at an empty file slot.Normally, when you start a new game, you will have no gold on this new file. However, if you start a new game as explained above, after suspending a previously existing save file, the new game will have the exact amount of gold the pre-existing game file had.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Fire Pro Joshi All-Star Dream Slam (also known as Zen-Nippon Joshi Pro Wrestling Kounin: Fire Pro Joshi All-Star Dream Slam) is an all-female wrestling game from Human Entertainment and uses their 16-bit isometric Fire Pro Wrestling engine. The wrestlers are all taken from the Zen-Nippon Joshi Pro Wrestling ("All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling") circuit, an exclusively female wrestling promotion that lasted for many years in Japan.[CR]As with prior Fire Pro Wrestling games, the mechanics behind the moves, pins and submissions rely more on timing and rhythm than button-mashing. Each bout is depicted with an isometric perspective, and various configurations of single-player and two-player controls are available for one-on-one matches and tag teams. The game features 18 pre-generated wrestlers and six create-a-wrestler slots.[CR]	</plot>

			<plot>Ornic Senki is a remake of  First Queen. The game retains the basic gameplay and the story of the original. Some scenes and dialogues were added (for example, the intro features a detailed account of what happened in different kingdoms after the Ornic invasion, which was absent in the original version). The battle system remains the same, but the player has more options to customize the party AI. Also, instead of choosing locations from a menu and being able to view the world map only before major battles, the player is actually navigating the world map now, physically moving to the dots that represent locations. [CR]The remake features new musical compositions and sound effects, as well as more detailed 16-bit graphics.</plot>

The manga tells of the running track that will make the young hoodlum Hanamichi Sakuragi who joined the basketball club in Shohoku high school just because initially interested in the sister of the captain Akagi but later this sport will conquer him so much that he becomes a real basketman.[CR]The game is essentially an arcade sports title basketball basically. The main screen there will be little choice given the presence of only three modes: Story mode and classic friendly tournament. In the first we follow the events of the television series whose plot differs slightly from the original one: using Shohoku then we will qualify for the national championship. The second and third but I think there is a need for further explanation.[CR]Executable field operations would also be different, you can also feint shots and blow up their opponents markers. Then successfully accumulating a sequence of 'affirmative action' row (steps succeeded, baskets made or avoided), will fill a horizontal bar at the top of the screen and, as he did a little 'in the playroom with the SNK Street Hoop, pressing simultaneously the three keys will not dorsal (except B), you can make a super nice shooting with supplemental animations depending on the player used.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Sakuragi with his old hairstyle[CR]In the choice of exhibition teams, when you move the cursor to Shohoku, and press A while holding LR, Sakuragi gets his old hairstyle (known as "Regent perm").[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Access the game ending/credits[CR]When you enter "we are strong" (see the screenshots section for more details) as password, you get to the ending (credits).</plot>

			<title_clean>Front Mission</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Front Mission is the first video game in the Front Mission franchise. Released on February 24, 1995, the game was a unique title in the turn-based strategy and RPG markets in Japan. Set in a near-future version of the planet Earth in the late 21st century, Front Mission's storyline weaved a complex tale of military, political, and technological conspiracy, all centered around a major conflict set in a fictional Pacific Ocean island known as Huffman Island. A central focus of this was the inclusion of mecha known as "wanderpanzers" (German for "walking armor") or "wanzers" in short. This tale was the first of many that would later be revealed as small parts of an overarching serialized storyline running through numerous Front Mission titles.[CR]Front Mission received a direct port for the Bandai WonderSwan Color on July 12, 2002 in Japan. This port came with no new features other than the ability to speed up the battle sequences. One year later, a remake of the game titled  Front Mission 1st was released for the Sony PlayStation on October 23, 2003 in Japan. This remake had many changes and additions, the most notable of which was a second campaign to play the game through. Front Mission 1st would later get an enhanced port on the Nintendo DS, with even more changes and additions to the game. This version of the game was the only one to be localized into English and was released in North America on October 23, 2007.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story of Front Mission is set on a near-future Earth in A.D. 2090. In the early 21st century, a global recession and other worldwide crises forced many nations to set aside their differences and form large regional entities known as supranational unions. These large super-states heralded in what was called the "globalization revolution", as many people around the world were willing to move past national boundaries to work for the greater good of mankind. However, it would not be long before new wars and conflicts were fought between the supranational unions and their member states.[CR]In 2070, a war breaks out between the Oceania Cooperative Union (O.C.U.) and the United States of the New Continent (U.S.N.). This war was triggered by territorial and natural resource disputes on a new Pacific Ocean island known as Huffman, as both super-states had colonized the island a few years prior to. After the war ended in 2072, a border was formed by the Mail River located in the center of Huffman. An uneasy peace was kept in the following years, but this would not last long.[CR]By 2086, a series of disputes across Huffman Island known as the Huffman Crisis leads both the O.C.U. and the U.S.N. to begin war preparations. Tensions began to rise and by 2089, the two super-states started to recruit mercenaries from all over the world to guard their borders at Mail River. An attack on a U.S.N. munitions plant in the Larcus District on June 3, 2090 becomes the catalyst for what would later be known as the 2nd Huffman Conflict.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Devising a strategy[CR]Front Mission is a turn-based strategy game, designed to resemble to Intelligent Design's  Fire Emblem series. The camera is angled isometrically on a grid-based map where characters are placed. Each round plays out beginning with the player acting first, followed by the opponent. Players move all of their characters in their turn. When characters engage in combat, the game shifts to another screen. Players choose the weapon they wish to use or the action to take if on defense. Then, in turn, each wanzer will take their action. Each wanzer has 4 health bars, two small bars for each arm, and two large bars, one for the body, and one for the legs. If an arm is destroyed, whatever the wanzer was carrying in that arm becomes unusable. If the legs are destroyed, the wanzer's movement is greatly limited. Finally, if the body is destroyed, the wanzer becomes inoperable.[CR]In between combat, players can customize their wanzers. The game's stores offer a variety of wanzer parts to beef up your robots. There are a variety of weapons, bodies, legs, CPUs, and other items with which to customize. Each wanzer is limited by the supply of power it has, and it's weight. You cannot overload a wanzer with too many weapons, as it will surpass the allowed power. There are upgrades to power, but it is never unlimited. There are a variety of weapons in the game, melee, short-range, and long-range. Wanzers can simply punch with their arms, use hand-mounted melee weapons, shotguns, flamethrowers, machine guns, rifles, and the long range missiles. Each arm can carry one weapon, and a long range weapon or a shield can be place on the shoulder. There are also a number of options for your wanzer's legs and movement. The most common options are legs, but wheels, treads, and hover types are also available.[CR]Missions in the game are varied from taking out all opponents, certain opponents, escort missions, defense missions, and more.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] The Ziege Gun[CR]In Mission 15,move to the top left-most corner of the map.  You will find a weapon called the ''Ziege Gun'', which can either be sold for 15000 Huffmann Dollars,or equipped.  It has 1x99 damage,and gives 700 exp. on a miss. </plot>

			<plot>The year is 2064, when the great solar power satellite, ATLAS is overshadowed by the invention of fusion power. The government alliance that had supported the building of ATLAS now find themselves facing economic crisis as the balance of power shifts. In this world of conflict and change, the Walking Panzer, or Wanzer, (a form of mecha) becomes the standard armored unit for wars and petty battles across the globe. For the small nation of Bergen, a coup d'etat is underway, staged by Colonel Ark. Seeking to establish complete control over the government and the NORAD units stationed there, Ark's first step involves the capture of President Orwen. Tipped off to the rebellion, Orwen seeks to flee from Bergen, looking for safe passage out of the seaport of Port Ertothal. A young Wanzer pilot, Albert Grabner, is assigned escort duty to the president by loyal elements of the army stationed there...[CR]Gun Hazard is a side-scrolling version of the Front Mission series. Gameplay is more than a little similar to Cybernator or Metal Warriors. The player moves between different stages on an area map. Once inside a level, the player controls Albert and his wanzer as it moves left, right across the screen. The wanzer is able to jump, and attack with a primary and a special weapon. At any time during a level, Albert can eject from his heavily armed wanzer to explore. Although vulnerable when outside, Albert is able to reach areas the wanzer cannot, in addition to being a smaller target and being able to jetpack indefinitely.[CR]Additionally, Albert can recruit other characters through the normal course of the story, some of whom can be designated to support roles. These support characters when set can provide a variety of different cover fire abilities for Albert during his missions. They too gain experience and levels. Different weapons and armor can be found or bought. Essential components include the Booster ability which allows the wanzer to hover and increase it's jumps, as well as the Dash ability which allows quick left-right movement by the wanzer. Money and experience are earned through the completion of level objectives as well as the kill count of enemy wanzers.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 2nd Player Play as Partner Code[CR]It is possible for a second player to play as the computer-controlled partner.[CR]During play while you have a partner,  press Down + L + R + Start on the second  [CR]controller.</plot>

			<plot>The year is 1999. A boy named Gen lives together with his mother in a small Japanese city. One day he goes to the nearby mountains and discovers an underground cave. In this cave, he encounters a strange bat-like creature guarding what appears to be a huge diamond. When Gen approaches the diamond, the floor crumbles, and all he can see is a group of aliens descending on the Earth...[CR]Gen is awakened by a man in a military uniform. He quickly gets up, and notices a calender. The year is 2009! Ten years have passed, of which there is no recollection in Gen's memory. The world has changed a lot during those years. Aliens have invaded the Earth, many cities are destroyed, and he find himself amidst the members of an underground resistance movement. Now he has to travel all over the world, help the humans in their struggle, and discover the secret of the invasion.[CR]The game is a console-style RPG with randomly encountered enemies whom you fight in turn-based combat viewed from "over-the-shoulder" perspective, similar to Phantasy Star IV. Gen and other party members develop special powers called "chakra", which can be leveled up just like the characters themselves.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Galaxy Robo is a sci-fi strategy game from Copya System and Imagineer. The player directs a group of mech pilots, each riding distinctive bi-pedal suits and other vehicles. The game is structurally similar to Fire Emblem: the player moves all their units for their turn, either fighting enemy units or performing other tasks, and then control switches to the opponent. When two units meet in combat, a cutaway cutscene shows the aggressor landing (or missing) a hit, and the unit statistics underneath tell the player how much damage was caused.[CR]The game was a Japanese exclusive. It was one of a handful of games to use the SNES Mouse peripheral.</plot>

			<plot>Home version of the 1979 arcade game of the same name. The aim is to launch missiles from the bottom of the screen at enemy spacecraft located at the top. To get there, the missile must pass through a asteroid belt flying across the screen and avoid the shots being fired down from the spacecraft. It is the players job to control the missile. Once launched it can be moved left and right and can be sped up by using the boost to speed it's way out of trouble. Points scored depend on the location of the hit on the enemy spacecraft. The speed at which enemy spacecraft move increases as the number of them decreases. Once all spacecraft have been destroyed, another wave starts, the speed decreases again and the process repeats. A life is lost when a missile is hit by a shot or collides with an asteroid.[CR]Three game modes are available, B&amp;W and Color recreate the graphics and behaviour of the original arcade game in black &amp; white and color respectively whilst Neo mode updates the game with improved graphics and slightly different behaviour. There's also a turn-based two player mode. Other options include changing the number of lives available at the start of a game and the number of points needed for an extra ship.</plot>

			<title_clean>Ganbare Goemon - Yuki Hime Kyuushutsu Emaki</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Legend of the Mystical Ninja is the fifth game in the Ganbare Goemon series. It is the first game in the series to appear on the SNES, and the first to be localized for and published in America.PlotOkay, so the plot is a bit strange.[CR]The game takes place in a cartoonish representation of feudal Japan. The story follows Goemon and Ebisumaru's ( Kid Ying and Dr Yang in the non-Japanese releases) journey across Japan to rescue Princess Yuki, who had been kidnapped by the Otafu Army. Along the way, they fight past all manner of ninjas, monsters, ghosts, quiz-show hosts, villiagers, and robots.Gameplay[CR]The game is divided into multiple Warlock Zones, each one representing a different area around Japan. Each zone is split into two sections:The first section is a pseudo-3D villiage area where the protagonists fight against the various locals while  shopping for health items and powerups. These sections also host the game's  minigames, where players can take a break from the main game and earn extra cash and bonus items. The second section is a 2D side-scrolling platforming level. These levels contain the majority of the combat, and end with a climactic  boss fight.[CR]Minigames[CR]Game Center, hosted by Konami Girl[CR]The Legend of the Mystical Ninja has numerous minigames within the villiage areas in each stage. Some are within the Game Center area, while others are located in various homes and shopping centers in the level. Most of the games have a fee or opening wager to play, but usually have a way for the player to win cash or special prizes.Gradius[CR]Located in the Game Center. This is the first level of Konami's classic side-scrolling shooter, Gradius.Tear Down The Wall[CR]Located in the Game Center. Tear Down The Wall is a Breakout-style game where the player bounces a ball on a paddle to destroy bricks at the top of the screen.Hockey[CR]Located in the Game Center. An air hockey game for two players.Mole[CR]Located in the employment office. This is a Whack-A-Mole game played with the SNES controller. Moles pop up from eight holes on the play field, where each hole corresponds to a button or direction on the SNES D-pad. Players get more money for each mole struck.Paint[CR]Located in the employment office. In this game, the player controls the direction of a constantly-moving paint roller. The task is to paint as much of the canvas as possible without hitting a wall or overpainting any area. One dollar is awarded for every space that the player paints. One or two players, $80 entry fee.Goblin[CR]Located in the employment office. In Goblin, the player must toss a ball into a basket that constantly moves from side to side. The force of the throw is controlled by how long the throw button is held down. Players get money for the balls they get in the basket. Sixty-dollar entry fee.Quiz[CR]In the Quiz Show game, players are asked trivia questions about the game by Quiz Master Shimopy. There is an entry fee of $100, with the chance to win $300.DiceRoll the bones[CR]In some houses around the game, there is a woman who will offer to play a game of dice. In the game, three dice are rolled, and the player guesses whether the outcome will be 10 or lower, or 11 or higher. The player places a bet which they can double if they guess correctly, or lose if they guess wrong.Fortune-Telling[CR]The fortune-teller offers to read Goemon's future for a $50 fee. He will tell the player that something good, something bad, or nothing will happen. Based on his vision of the future, immediately upon exiting his house the player will encounter five Geishas (which can be collected for $50 each), five spear-toting villagers, or nothing at all.MazeOne of the many game-house barkers[CR]Up to two players can pay a $100 entry fee to explore a first-person labyrinth. Prizes hidden in the depths of the maze include bombs, scrolls, and cash that if found, are worth more than the fee taken at the door.Lottery[CR]Buy a ticket and participate in the game lottery. If the symbols that appear in the lottery match the symbols on the ticket, the player can win a cash prize.Memory[CR]For two players or play against the computer. Flip over two matching cards and win cash prizes. Increase the purse by matching a random special card.Horse Races[CR]The horse race track appears in the carnival area of the game in the third Warlock Zone. Players may bet as much as they like on different horses, and winnings are dependent on the odds of the fastest horse.[CR]Codes and Trivia[CR]The Konami Code[CR]In one of the houses in the game, the man living there will advise the player that if they "use the command Up Up Down Down L R L R B A...nothing will happen." True to his word, the famous Konami Code has no effect in Legend of the Mystical NinjaInfinite Hamburgers[CR]This code uses the game's password save system to activate. By entering the password vxZ lh:@Y nn3 1 $T KK hG:!&lt; ! X@ r the player will start on the third stage with an infinite supply of hamburgers, essentially granting infinite health.[CR] Konami Man[CR]The character with the winged hat who appears above the entrance to the Maze minigame is Konami Man. He was Konami's official mascot at the time The Legend of the Mystical Ninja was created. Konami Man was the star of a Japan-only Nintendo Famicom game called Wai Wai World.[CR] Deleted Scene[CR]The Japanese version of The Legend of the Mystical Ninja contained a storefront in the Amusement Park zone that was not present in the American release. Even though it is mentioned in the instruction manual as "Sammy Rye's Circus Side Show," it does not appear in the actual game. For a fee, Goemon can enter the side show and see four clones of Ebisumaru do a short dance.[CR] Takosuke[CR]On the bridge leading away from the Amusement Park zone on Awaji Island, the player encounters Takosuke. This huge red octopus is another of Konami's characters, who appears in the Parodius series. In the vignette that follows this level, Takosuke can be seen in the background, climbing the Konami headquarters building on Awaji.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Last Level +[CR]From the menu select "Continue" and then "From Logbook Entry" and enter this as your logbook to start on the last level with full health, a weapon at level three, all items, and all jutsus.  From here, simply keep heading up and left through the hallways until you get to a cell with a white wall.  Hit different parts of the wall until you hear a sound like you're making contact.  Keep hitting that spot and a door will open up.  Enter and you're on the last side-scrolling mission stocked to the gills.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Last Level +[CR]From the menu select "Continue" and then "From Logbook Entry" and enter this as your logbook to start on the second to last level with full health, a weapon at level three, all items, and all jutsus. From here, keep heading up and go through the doors to the castle. You'll meet the king who will tell you to go find the secret passage.  Exit, go down one screen, go left until you see three statues.  Beat the middle one until it breaks.  Enter and you're on the second to last side-scrolling mission stocked to the gills.  (Because there's no 'heart' nor 'triangle' character on my keyboard, I've used  to mean 'heart' and  to mean 'triangle'.  Make the appropriate substitutions when entering the code.)</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ganbare Goemon 3: Shishijyuurokubei no Karakuri Manji Katame is the third Super Famicom Ganbare Goemon game (of five) and the twelfth overall. The plot concerns the Wise Man, the lecherous genius who built Sasuke and the other ninja mechanical dolls (Katakuri), who discovers a means to travel to the future to hit on modern Japanese girls. While in the future he is taken hostage by a familiar-looking nun and it's up to Goemon, Ebisumaru, Sasuke and the newly playable Yae to chase through time after him. Goemon's enormous robot doppelganger Impact also makes an appearance.[CR]The game is the first in the Goemon series to do away with the stage structure of earlier games, in which the player would have an "adventure stage" where Goemon and co. explore overworld sections and then an "action stage" which had more overt 2D side-scrolling platformer gameplay. The overworld is now a lot larger and interconnected, and entering certain areas lead to their action stages.[CR]	</plot>

			<plot>Fourth title in the Ganbare Goemon series of platform/adventure games which cast you as the heroic Goemon and his gang of wacky adventurers as he fights evil all over Japan. This sequel however, takes the action to outer space as the gang attempts to rescue Goemon Impact (Goemon's giant mecha) from a strange planet.[CR]The game is based around a stage-select hub from which you select which character you want to play as and then attempt to clear the game's many side scrolling stages in standard action platformer fashion, navigating the obstacles and defeating all enemies you run into with your weapons. Since each one of Goemon's allies got stranded on a different planet, you must take control of each one of them in order to clear the stages and recover the special ability unique to each character that must be later put to use to release Goemon Impact. As in other games of the series there are also loads of mini-games and unique gameplay sequences triggered in boss fights, bonus stages and special situations. These involve shooter sequences, racing &amp; sport games and other assorted diversions.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Alternate Colors[CR]Once you gain the ability to switch between the characters, you can get new coloring for them.  Just hold down the attack button while switching.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Fatal Fury (also known as Fatal Fury: King of Fighters, and known in Japan as Legend of the Hungry Wolf: The Battle of Destiny), is a 2D fighting game developed and released by SNK for arcades (using the Neo Geo MVS hardware) and the Neo Geo AES on December 20, 1991.The first fighting game released for the Neo Geo (and the first fighting game developed by SNK), Fatal Fury was designed as a spiritual successor to the original Street Fighter (by its creator, Takashi Nishiyama). Developed around the same time as Street Fighter II (and released a half a year later), Fatal Fury introduced a special "dual line" system (where most stages allow players to fight between the foreground and the background areas). It also introduced the concept of team fights (as a second player joining in must help the first player defeat their opponent before the versus match begins) and mid-match stage changes (changing either the time of day or the weather). The game would later receive numerous sequels throughout the Neo Geo's life cycle.Set in the fictional American city of South Town, Fatal Fury follows American martial artist Terry Bogard, his younger Ninjitsu brother Andy Bogard, and their Japanese Muay Thai kick boxer friend Joe Higashi as they enter the "King of Fighters" tournament (which is not to be confused with the tournaments in the King of Fighters game series) to seek revenge on its sponsor: underworld crime boss Geese Howard.[CR]The game was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (removing the dual line system, team fights, and bonus rounds) and the Genesis (removing two opponents) during 1993, both by Takara. These ports made the other characters playable but removed or changed some of the other features (both versions removing the standard bonus rounds and team fights, the SNES version removing the dual line system, and the Genesis version removing some opponents) Other ports during that era include the Sharp X68000 (on May 21, 1993 for Japan only) and the Neo Geo CD (by SNK on September 9, 1994). The original version was also included in two compilations: Fatal Fury: Battle Archives Volume 1 (for the PlayStation 2) and SNK Arcade Classics Volume 1 (for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and Wii) compilations, and was digitally released for the Wii (via the Virtual Console on September 21, 2007), PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Portable (both via PlayStation Network on December 21, 2010, later made available for the PlayStation Vita).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Fatal Fury plays like a traditional fighting game. The player has three attack buttons: Punch, Kick, and Throw. Each character have special moves whose input commands are shown during the course of the game (after every bonus round) as opposed to being given in an instruction card in the game's cabinet.The game introduced a unique and novel fighting game concept to the franchise: that fighters can fight on two different areas (known as "lines" or "planes") instead of just one. This allows characters to dodge attacks and projectiles completely rather than block them. While this was heavily expanded in later games, this game does not allow the player character to freely move among the lines. Instead, the player character can knock the opponent to the other area and follow up with a quick roll or a jump kick. Some stages have only one area, with the other area blocked off by obstacles (in which knocking the opponent into the obstacles bounce them back to the main area).After every two matches, the player is allowed to participate in a bonus round in which they arm wrestle a machine by mashing the Punch button as fast as possible.Fatal Fury is the only fighting game in the series where if a second player joins in the middle of a fight, the fight is not interrupted so that the two players could battle.

The player must learn their tactics and defeat them while preserving as much of their health as possible, as they will often have to fight several bosses in a row without being able to heal. There's also the occasional action sequence, such as a vaguely shoot 'em up part that leads to a tough fight against a colossal enemy.[CR]The game was featured on the 13th season of the popular gaming Japanese TV show GameCenter CX.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hidden Options Menu[CR]Enter the following at the title screen.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Genocide 2 is a side-scrolling action game featuring a 12m mech charging through a number of locations wielding a laser sword. It was originally released in 1991 for the Sharp X68000 with the subtitle Master of the Dark Communion, and was later ported to the Super Famicom in 1994 with the prefix "G2" (thought to be a reference to the Terminator 2 movie, colloquially known as T2). [CR]It is the sequel to Genocide, which was also released first on the Sharp X68000 and later received a PC Engine CD-ROM conversion.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]While the world struggled to recover from the war of the first game, the multinational corporation CONEX appeared to rebuild the world's infrastructure. However, their true plan was global conquest, and now the only man who can stop CONEX is the same pilot who saved the world the first time around.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player takes control of the mechanical suit called the Tracer. It attacks almost entirely with its sword, but also has an onboard flying weapon called the Betty. The Betty can fly in multiple directions and block bullets as well.[CR]Most stages in Genocide 2 are linear, but some also require the player to search the area for targets to destroy. At the end of most stages is a boss fight.[CR]Version Differences[CR]The SFC version of G2 skips the 68000 version's prologue level, flips the order of stages 1-1 and 1-2, and removes several minor enemy types. It also added a cooldown to the Betty.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Option Codes[CR]Enter the Options screen and press the following buttons:</plot>

			<plot>Ghost Chaser Densei doesn't take any dramatic departures from the standard scrolling-brawler plot-line. A city twenty minutes in the future must be saved from a terrorist organization, and between salvation and you is a long, straight line full of goons who must be punched. Aside from receiving orders from your boss before each level, and the quick conversation with a boss or rare NPC, the story won't attempt to get in the way of beat-downs.[CR]There are three playable characters in Ghost Chaser Densei: the martial artist Makai, the mace wielding cat-girl Iyo, and the autonomous robot Belva. Each has unique moves as well as the basic abilities of attacking, jumping, blocking, throwing, and using a special if attack and jump are pressed together. Unlike most brawlers these special moves deplete a recharging special bar, not your health. Makai can throw fireballs and do a flying kick in midair, Iyo can triangle jump and preform a spinning piledriver, and Belva can double jump and preform a grapple special. Characters also have a team up special if playing in two player mode. Enemies range from armored soldiers to lizard men to robots, but most break down into the same hierarchy: weaker types will rush at you while stronger types will shoot projectiles then rush at you. Each level ends with a unique boss with multiple short and long range attacks.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Change Costume Colour[CR]Let your character die, then push L and R when selecting and hold until your character reappears.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Change Costume Colour[CR]On the Main Menu screen, move the cursor to the number of players you will be using, push L, R, &amp;gt;, &amp;gt;, &amp;lt;, &amp;lt;, and then L and R together and hold.

			<title_clean>Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu is part of a long line of identically titled games based on the anime and manga of the same name, which is usually localized as Legend of the Galactic Heroes. It is, however, the first and only game of the series to be released on the Super Famicom. The anime/manga series is known for its massive fleet-based skirmishes, its profuse amount of classical music and the Death Note-esque tactical rivalry between the two protagonists, Reinhard and Yang Wen-li: two military geniuses on either side of a centuries-old conflict.[CR]The SNES version is far more like a simulation than most games of this type, with players directing their fleet and combat from a computer console. The goal is effective macro-level management of the large number of ships under the player's command, rather than focusing on any one ship and its encounters.</plot>

			<plot>Ackman is not what one would call a good person. His job is to murder and steal souls for the Demon Lord. The angel Tenshi has taken it upon himself to put an end to Ackman's nefarious ways, and sends an army of angels and hired assassins to take out Ackman for good. It's just as well, because Ackman was getting bored without anyone to kill.[CR]Go Go Ackman is a scrolling platformer starring the titular Ackman. Ackman can punch and charge up a ranged wave of energy, and he can also jump on some enemies to stun them before running into them and turning them into a sliding projectile. Ackman can hold up to three bombs that can clear the screen of enemies, and can also hold a weapon, either a sword, boomerang, or pistol, but it will be lost if Ackman is hit. Levels are linear, but do allow some exploration to find weapons and items hidden off the beaten road.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] View the ending[CR]At the Banpresto logo screen, press A+B+X+Y.</plot>

			<plot>Yet again Tenshi is hard at work on finding a way to kill off Ackman for good. But, what's this, it seems there's been a shake up in the chain of command, and now Tenshi is wanted by the Angel Police! Will Tenshi be able to clear his good name? Who's really pulling the strings here? And, most importantly, does Ackman care about any of this at all?[CR]The last of the Ackman games, Go Go Ackman 3 makes very few changes from Go Go Ackman 2, although Tenshi is now a playable character. Both Ackman and Tenshi can be switched between at special points in a level, but they share the same health meter and weapon. Unlike Ackman Tenshi can fly, but as he is an angel he can not collect the souls of enemies he kills. Souls have changed too, and are now used as currency in shops where Ackman can buy temporary powerups or healing. Finally Ackman has lost the ability to slide enemies along the ground, but he can now move while holding a stunned enemy.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Level Select[CR]At the title screen while holding Up, L, and R at the same time, press Start to access the Level Select screen.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Gon is a side-scrolling platformer starring the tiny dinosaur Gon. Like the manga the little dino hails from, the game is completely devoid of narration or dialogue. The story is told through contextual scenes - such as Gon getting annoyed by an ape that steals his fruit and chases after it - and continues to provide excuses for Gon to travel the globe in search for food.[CR]Gon is invincible, due to his incredibly thick skin and skull, so instead the game eventually ends when Gon gets so agitated by the local fauna (by taking too much damage, for instance) that he destroys the planet. The player is extended the option to restart from the last checkpoint if this should happen.[CR]The game is exclusive to the Super Famicom. Gon would next appear in a video game with the 1998 PlayStation version of Tekken 3 where he cameos as a hidden fighter.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Level Passwords[CR]At the start screen select password and enter the following</plot>

			<title_clean>Goofy to Max - Kaizoku-jima no Daibouken</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Goof Troop is an action-adventure game created by Capcom, and released in 1993 for the Super Nintendo. The game is based on the children's cartoon of the same name by Disney. One of the game's key features is that two players can play cooperatively as Goofy and his son Max.[CR]Goof Troop was designed by Shinji Mikami, who later became famous for his work on games like Resident Evil 4 and Viewtiful Joe.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Max and some pirates[CR]Goofy and Max, the game's protagonaists, are heading out to fish on an absolutely gorgeous day in Spoonerville. As the two relax along the seashore, they witness a massive pirate ship sailing towards Spoonerville, with their friends Pete and P.J. aboard. They realize that their friends are aboard against their will, and they must have been kidnapped. Goofy makes a heroic attempt to pursue the boat, but ultimately is unable to catch the pirates before they arrive on their home island.[CR]Goofy and Max make haste to the Pirate island, and upon arrival encounter a group of pirates. Once they defeat their attackers, they learn that the pirates have mistaken their friend Pete for pirate captain Keelhaul Pete, who was swallowed by a massive whale long ago. Goofy and Max set off to save their friends from these delusional pirates.[CR]Unfortunately for Goofy and Max, Pete and P.J. decide that they enjoy being pirate royalty. The longer that Goofy and Max take to reach them, the more Pete wants to stay captain of these pirates.[CR]Goofy and Max, after much adventuring, find themselves at the pirate's ship. They find who they think is Pete, but when Goofy attempts to save him, he knocks him cold on accident. Upon furtherIn a cave[CR]investigation, Goofy and Max realize they have found the real Keelhaul Pete, who had recently been spat out by the whale! Goofy and Max venture into the pirate ship, still looking to save their friends. Keelhaul Pete appears again, hoping to put an end to their quest. Goofy and Max prove a formidable opponent, however, and once again knock him flat on his back. Goofy and Max arrive just in time to save Pete and P.J. from the jaws of a large gator, who Goofy finds suspcious, as the Gator is eating before supper time. Trapping Keelhaul Pete to make sure he causes no more trouble, Goofy and company leave the ship to finally relax and do a little fishing.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Goof Troop takes players through five various areas on Spoonerville Island. Players begin on a beach, followed by a village under siege, then move on to a spooky haunted castle, a mountain valley, and finally end up on a Pirate Ship where their friends Pete and PJ are being held captive.[CR]Players have a variety of options when taking on enemies by throwing items such as barrels or pots. There are also other items with more novel uses, such as a grappling hook to grab on to far off items or a bell that will catch the enemy's attention. The grappling hook comes especially in handy for crossing obstacles. Only one player can have each item at any particular time, and players must work together to get the best use out of all the game's equipment.A maze of a bridge[CR]If players come into contact with an enemy or fall prey to other hazards in the game, they lose a life. Once enough lives have been lost, they must use a continue to get back in the game. Goofy and Max can pick up red diamonds for extra lives, or special white diamonds to gain an extra continue.[CR]One of Goof Troop's main aspects are the numerous puzzles throughout each level. There are many puzzles that include kicking sliding blocks in order to press switches to open passages. Players must also search for special keys to open doors to bosses. Many of the game's items come in handy for the game's puzzles.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When reviewed by Electronic Gaming Monthly the game received scores of 7,8,8 and 8 adding, "...I can't stand games that have beaten enemies reappear when you enter the room again. Also, the game is just too easy! It seems strongly geared toward the younger playing audience". Mike Weigand disagreed, "...this game requires enough skill and brains to keep you busy, plus it keeps you coming back for more".[CR]		</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Power Instinct (JP: Gouketuji Ichizoku, or "The Gouketuji Clan") is a competitive fighter game featuring eight different fighters, and one unplayable boss character. The fighters are competing to take control of the eponymous clan, who honors combat prowess above all else. The two daughters of the Clan, Otane and Oume, are favorites to win the tournament, but several other challengers across the globe intend to win the contest for their own reasons.[CR]Power Instinct is the first game in the Power Instinct series. It debuted in the Arcades in 1993 and was released on the SNES and Genesis the following year.CharactersOtane Goketsuji: An elderly woman and scion of the Gouketuji clan. Was threatened and abused endlessly by her older sister, Oume. Trained in secrecy for many years to surpass her, to the extent that she now has superhuman ability.Angela Belti: A physically imposing Italian strongwoman who follows her heart into dangerous situations.Annie Hamilton: A young English woman with a fondness for animals, which also feature in her specials.Keith Wayne: A cocky American martial artist and ex-gang member. He enters the tournament for his own pride, but falls in love with Annie and is determined to win her over.Reiji Oyama: An overly serious Japanese fighter who is focused purely on combat. Meant to be a parody of other overly serious martial arts, like Street Fighter 2's Ryu.Saizo Hattori: A mysterious ninja from Japan who keeps his face, and emotions, carefully hidden.Thin Nen: A Chinese Shaolin monk with mystical powers whose greed is insurmountable.White Buffalo: A Native American warrior who appreciates nature.Oume Goketsuji: An elderly woman, physically similar to Otane. Is considered one of the most powerful human beings alive due to her martial prowess and Goketsuji clan connections. Bitterly despises her younger sister Otane and is the final boss for the game (and is thus unplayable by any conventional means).[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Play as Super Otane[CR]After the code is entered select the 2nd player to go to the stage select screen, and press start.</plot>

			<title_clean>GS Mikami - Joreishi wa Nice Body</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Based off of Shiina Takashi's popular manga series of the early 90s, Ghost Sweeper Mikami: Gokuraku Daisakusen ( GS&#32654;&#31070; &#26997;&#27005;&#22823;&#20316;&#25126;!!, GS Mikami Big Paradise Operation), this platformer puts the player in control of Mikami Reiko, a somewhat shallow exorcist working in Tokyo. The game's title, "Joreishi wa Nice Body" ( &#38500;&#38666;&#24107;&#12399;&#12490;&#12452;&#12473;&#12496;&#12487;&#12451;&#65374;) means "the master exorcist with the nice body".[CR]The story of the game is quite simple: One day Mikami receives a strange package from Yakuchin at her office which has an unusual statue, allegedly of the goddess "Aegis", in it. A note enclosed says several ghosts have stones that are supposed to be set in the statue and that the statue, when complete, is worth an incredible amount of money. Mikami decided to go ahead and fix it, hoping to get some sort of compensation in the deal. But the statue might not be all it appears....[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls Mikami, moving her left or right with the D pad; she can also crouch. Jumping is performed with the B button, while attacking is performed with the A button; holding up and attack makes Mikami perform an overhead swing. In addition, special floating platforms will be encountered periodically throughout the game; they are noticeably marked with a spirit seal and candles. Mikami can grab on to these by jumping and pressing up and attack; while hanging on, pressing up again will cause her to do a flip kick (which can hit enemies) and vault to the top of the platform. There are also several types of magic and items to be found in the game. Two of them are bomb-type items which the player can use by pressing the X button, should they have any in stock.Magic[CR]Mikami can find several types of magic in the game. They add an additional effect to her basic attack.The raikou magic item.Raikou: Mikami will shoot a bolt of lightning straight forward when she attacks.Kamaitachi: Mikami fires a short-ranged crescent slash whenever she attacks.Hyouchuu: Mikami fires two spikes of ice as slight angles both upwards and downwards when she attacks.Platform creator: This un-named ability is automatically given to Mikami in stage 7; it is necessary to complete the state. Mikami shoots out ofuda that generate platforms.Items[CR]The following are the items Mikami can find.Cake: Restores a point of Mikami's life.Ofuda: The classic spirit sealing paper strips. This allows Mikami to perform a sealing bomb attack, which destroys all enemies on screen.Seireiseki: A spirit-stone earring. This allows Mikami to perform a spirit stone bomb, which also destroys all enemies on screen. It has a different visual effect than the ofuda.Mystery mark: A question mark that makes Mikami invincible for a brief period.1up: A Mikami doll that nets the player an extra life.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Mikami Reiko: An attractive, 20 year old ghost sweeper. She manages to pick up things very quickly and as a consequence is skillful at a wide variety of activities; however, she's somewhat arrogant, boastful, and definitely greedy! Despite all this, she's a good person inside.[CR]Yokoshima Tadao: A 17 year old high-school student who Mikami employs at her office as a general dogsbody. He is stupid, incompetent, unlucky, and perverted. But he'll work for much less than minimum wage![CR]Okinu-chan: The ghost of a girl who died sacrificing herself 300 years ago. After being forced to haunt a mountain for a long period of time, she forgot how to rest in peace, so she became another employee of Mikami. She's of a pure and honest character, and is friendly and helpful and often finds the modern world quite wondrous.[CR]Medusa: A demon woman of the dragon clan who is behind everything in this game. She can turn her hair in to snakes, but isn't a "medusa" in the conventional sense. In the manga, she is generally trying to assassinate Shouryuuki the dragon princess.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Many of the stages and chapters are references to events from the manga, or feature cameos of other characters.Stage 1![CR]Stage 1: The haunted bullet train! The first stage starts out on the streets of Tokyo, with Mikami eventually boarding the expected ghost train. Zombies roam the streets along with various ghosts, and ghostly passengers on the train would prefer not to be disturbed... don't get groped! The boss turns out to be an evil spirit that has possessed the train; the green car turns in to a mass of ectoplasm as it attacks Mikami! Mikami gets the first jewel for defeating this abomination against railways everywhere.The stage 2 boss.[CR]Stage 2: Mikami goes to a haunted mansion high in the mountains. Of course, this journey can't be a relaxing walk! The mountain path is treacherous as bridges give out and various ghostly and monstrous beings attack Mikami along the way. Arriving at the mansion heralds the boss fight; in this case, the vengeful spirit of a Licca-chan doll long abandoned. Beat the doll and get the second jewel![CR]Stage 3: Mini-Mikami! Mikami is shrunken by a magical dart shot by a spirit from the Jungles of Southeast Asia. Riding the back of a random cat, she gives chase across the rooftops of the city, avoiding bees, suspicious clouds of gas, etc.. until she catches up at a construction site. Defeat this flea-bitten goblin and get the third jewel.Stage 4.[CR]Stage 4: Dance with vegetables! This haunted green-house is full of chonchons and, of course, haunted vegetables. There are tomatoes here that would make Fozzie Bear cower in terror! Meiko, another character from the manga, makes a cameo near the end of the stage. The boss is the ghost of an angry dog, but he's not evil, simply protective of where his master's house once stood.Stage 5.[CR]Stage 5: Magic broom riding! Mikami soars through the skies over the city, battling past many a flying goblin and witch. The boss is the vampire Count Bloodeau, the evil father of the friendly dhampir Pietro!Stage 6.[CR]Stage 6: An amusement park under construction that has been taken over by Piper, the clown ghost. Various rock-theme ghosts and undead construction workers haunt this place. Beware the floor, it's a sea of rats! But that should come as little surprise, for Piper himself is truly.... don't let his tiny minions play their horns, or Mikami will be turned in to a child! With this, only one stone remains![CR]Stage 7: Yokoshima's dream world. Gravity changes periodically in this strange reality full of bunny girls and fairies. A special ability is awarded in this stage, the "platform creator" magic. Usage of it is necessary to scale some of the high walls and pits in this stage. The boss of the stage is Nightmare, who makes Mikami battle her high-school self. If Nightmare himself is forced in to combat, he's actually incapable of doing anything except cowering and trying to escape. With Nightmare's defeat, the final gem is obtained![CR]Mikami finally completes the statue... but wait! The whole thing was a trap by Medusa! The final battle awaits![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Level Passwords[CR]At the title screen go to ''option'' and ''password'' then enter the following chain.</plot>

			<title_clean>Hameln no Violin Hiki</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Violinist of Hameln is an action platformer developed by Daft and published by Enix for the Super Famicom platform.[CR]Loosely based off some of the earlier chapters of the manga series Hameln no Violin Hiki, this amusing action platformer covers the adventures of Hamel and Flute up to the point where they first encounter Sizer. The game's sound track features a number of famous pieces of classical music (eg. Mozart's symphony number 25 in G minor).[CR]The Violinist of Hameln was released in Japan on September 29, 1995 and it was never brought to any other country. An unofficial English translation patch was released by J2e Translations on January 21, 2001.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player controls Hamel, accompanied by Oboe and Flute. Hamel moves around the levels via jumping and gliding with the use of a cape. Combat consists of musical note attacks that corespond to directional pad inputs. In addition, Hamel must interact with Flute to solve the many puzzles along the way. The player can pick up Flute and throw her as a projectile or can force her to dress in a variety of silly humiliating costumes that have special abilities. The various costumes (assigned via a pause screen) have special abilities: the ostrich costume can walk over spikes, the frog costume jumps extremely high, the curling iron slides along the ground and quickly decimates enemies. When thrown, Flute can break various types of stone obstacles that are otherwise indestructible. Any enemies struck by Flute generate coins when destroyed, so throwing Flute is a good way to build up money generating anywhere from zero to five coins based on how much damage she has absorbed.[CR]Flute is technically invincible, but If the player gets Flute to the end of the stage unharmed they are awarded a bonus of two stars. The player can make Flute stay in place briefly and then call her to catch up with Oboe. If Flute ever falls in to a pit, Oboe will rescue her, but the player will not receive the star bonus for the stage.[CR]Items[CR]There are a wide variety of items to be found in the game, some items are found in the world and som must be purchased.Star: Get four of these in a stage to go to a bonus stage after crossing the goal.Music Note: Increases Hamel's attack power by one level.Fruit: Restores one point to Hamel's life gauge.Mysterious fruit: Completely refills Hamel's life gauge.Hat: An extra life.Coin: There are coins worth 1, 5, 10, and 50 coins per pickup.Hourglass: Adds more time to the timer.Key: Needed to open locked doors.Heart: Extends Hamel's life gauge by one point.Magic Wallet: Can only be purchased in town. Prevents gold from being lost when the player dies.Shield: Can only be purchased in town. It protects Flute from three hits.Magic Mantle: Can only be purchased in town. Hamel takes 3/4 damage, making him slightly more resilient.Time Sand: Can only be purchased in town. Automatically refills the timer completely should it run out.[CR]Curling Iron: Slides when thrown and can fit through narrow gaps.[CR]Costumes[CR]The various costumes that can be equipped by Flute.Ostrich: Can walk over spikes and has a high rate of speed.Frog: High jump.Robot: Can walk over spikes and jumping on its head causes it to punch, destroying enemies or breaking walls.Sunfish: Floats vertically, following currents of the wind.Penguin: Swims quickly in water. Jumping on Flute will cause her to headbutt enemies, but only while she's in water.Orangutan: No action but is necessary to impress some townsfolk.Duck: Swims on the surface of the water and can jump out of water in a forward direction. Jumping on the duck will cause it to temporarily submerge, allowing Hamel and Flute to pass under some obstructions.UFO: Floats around in an erratic manner. It rises when Hamel jumps and moves forward when he stands on it. In addition, it electrifies whenever it touches enemies. Can be purchased in town or found in stage three.Monkey: Advances forward, jumps over pits, and can climb walls.Frisbee: Toss Flute to have her fly forward a bit, then boomerang back and ricochet off objects.Monster: No action but is needed to trick some enemies in to thinking you're on their side.Elephant: Advances forward slowly. Jumping on Flute's head while she's in this costume will cause her to squirt water out of her trunk to put out flames.Eagle: Flies forwards. The player can maneuver it somewhat by pressing up and down on the control pad.Jennifer the Octopus: Allows Hamel and Flute to travel underwater.Nuclear Bomb: This costume can only be purchased in a shop for an extremely high price. When thrown, Flute detonates causing incredible damage to all enemies on screen. She can be thrown repeatedly.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]HamelHamel.[CR]The hero. He plays a giant violin with magical powers inherited from his mother, Pandora. He ruthlessly abuses and exploits Flute mostly because he thinks it's funny, but he's actually a good person deep inside. He is the son of the Demon King Kestra.FluteFlute.[CR]The heroine, a country girl from the village of Stocatto. She travels with Hamel after he saves some children from Tuba's soldiers. She doesn't realize it, but she is actually the princess of the great kingdom of Sforshando, hidden away as a baby to protect her from the Demon King's armies.OboeOboe.[CR]A talking crow who is Hamel's constant companion and, in essence, his conscience (although he gets ignored a lot). He thinks of Hamel as his son. In reality, he was originally one of Kestra's four top commanders and leader of the Demon Hawk army, but he's been stuck in crow form for going against his master.RaielRaiel.[CR]A childhood friend of Hamel's and a rival. He plays a magical piano that summons spirits; he seemingly has no trouble carrying it most of the time, but when it's pointed out that it ways over 500kg it will crush him. His nose bleeds whenever he sees anything "feminine".SizerSizer and Ocarina.[CR]The current leader of the Demon Hawk army. She wields a scythe which is also a flute, and has a mysterious relationship with Hamel.[CR]Areas[CR]Area 1The terrible Tuba.[CR]The countryside around Stocatto village, it consists of 8 stages (including the village) culminating in a fortress of the Demon Lizard army. The boss is Tuba, a gigantic officer of the aforementioned army.Area 2The belligerent Bassoon.[CR]The surroundings of river town, it consists of seven stages including the village. This area is being harassed by Bassoon, a commander of the Demon Beast army; he has killed the parents of a small boy, and Flute asks Hamel to help. Many of the stages are full of ruins, and much of the area is taken up by Bassoon's castle.Area 3The frightful Fagotto.[CR]A village and its surroundings in a volcanic area, consisting of seven stages including the village itself. It has been decimated by a division of the Demon Undead army led by a skeletal officer named Fagotto. The parents of a small girl are stuck in one of the mines since Fagotto's assault; once again Flute requests Hamel assistance.Area 4Sizer at last![CR]This area has been under attack for some time by Sizer's Demon Hawk army. Raiel confronts Hamel about being the son of the Demon King Kestra near the beginning. Hamel and Flute will finally encounter Sizer here.Secret[CR]After the game is completed a secret technique will be revealed for Hamel and Flute, the Tchaikovsky Attack. Rotate the D-pad 360 degrees and attack to perform this.[CR]	</plot>

It is also possible to hatch stronger monsters from eggs to assist the player's armies.[CR]The series' comedy often hinges on parody humor, and Aa Sekai Yo Nare is no exception: several of the egg monsters that the player hatches are spoofs of Final Fantasy IV characters (from another Square franchise).[CR]The game was originally released on the Super Famicom, though an updated WonderSwan Color version would later be released with additional creatures to summon and a graphical overhaul.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Endings and Easy Last Boss[CR]There are two endings in Hanjuku Hero.  If the boss Kuumon eats 5 or less egg monsters, you will fight Serious Boiled.  If Kuumon eats 6 or more egg monsters, you will fight Hyper Boiled.  The ending you see depends on the last boss you beat.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Endings and Easy Last Boss[CR]Hyper Boiled's attack are based on the egg monsters Kuumon eats, so if you want to beat Hyper Boiled easily, make sure Kuumon only eats egg monsters with weak attacks.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Spanky's Quest is a 2D puzzle platformer developed by Natsume and published by Taito for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in July 1992.[CR]Originally released in Japan in December 27, 1991 (as Hansei Zaru Jirou-kun no Daibouken, translated to Monkey Reflections: The Adventures of Mr. Jiro), players control an anthropomorphic monkey kid (named Spanky), who must journey through six towers to defeat an evil witch and return home. To do this, he must unlock doors (with keys found scattered throughout levels) while eliminating hostile anthropomorphic fruits and vegetables by various sports balls conjured by popping colored bubbles thrown by him. He can also collect hats (as single-level powerups) which grant different abilities.[CR]The handheld version, released for the Game Boy, was originally released in Japan (as Lucky Monkey) on April 26, 1991 (and released in North America at the same time as the SNES version). Unlike the SNES version, there are no keys or hats to pick up (and the concept of attacking with sports balls was changed to "bubble blasts"). However, players can collect bonus pickups (giving more score, collected for each enemy eliminated) and special "letter" pickups (either S, P, A, N, K, or Y, collected by eliminating more than one enemy with the same bubble blast). Collecting each of the six pickups immediately sends the player to the bonus stage.[CR]						</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Hashire Hebereke ("Run Hebereke") is an isometric racing game from SunSoft that features Hebereke, Sukezaemon, O-Chan and the rest of Hebereke's friends. The player must race across a course hitting three checkpoints before returning to the starting line to move onto the next lap. The courses all have different layouts and the player must use the D-pad to turn their character mid-sprint, often causing them to veer strongly from one side to the other. In the single-player the player, as Hebereke, has to challenge every other character on their respective courses. Characters have distinctive strengths and weaknesses that the player needs to ascertain in order to defeat them.[CR]Players can also acquire items that can help them out by running over certain spots on the course, similar to Super Mario Kart, and can collect multiple items and switch between them. The game also includes a tag mode and bonus rounds that involve getting chased in a circle by a giant boulder.[CR]As with most of the non-puzzle Hebereke games, Hashire Hebereke was exclusive to the Japanese Super Famicom.</plot>

			<plot>Hat Trick Hero 2 is the follow up to Hat Trick Hero, and it is loosely based on the arcade game Hat Trick Hero '93. One or two players can play in a exhibition game (one single match) or in a world league. The game scrolls horizontally uses mode 7 graphics to give the playing field some perspective.[CR]There are 18 countries to select from, each with different running, kicking and technical abilities. You can use 5 different formations, which are 4-4-2, 4-3-3, 3-5-2, WM and libero. You also select a team captain from 8 different characters.[CR]You can perform a foul tackle on the opponent, but when the referee is close enough to notice it you risk getting a yellow or red card. By holding down a direction after shooting the players can shoot the ball with curve effect. During the game a power-up bar is charged which can be used for special abilities. Holding down R allows you to run faster, but this slowly drains the power-up bar. With a fully charged power-up bar you can perform an unstoppable hyper shoot by pressing a special combination, and this drains the power-up bar entirely.</plot>

			<plot>This is an adventure game based on the old Japanese fairy tale about Momotaro, a boy who was found by an old couple inside of a huge peach (hence the name Momotaro - "Peach Guy"). Momotaro grows up and embarks on a journey to rid the land of the vicious tribe of ogres, and to take their treasures. On his way he meets three animals - a dog, a monkey, and a pheasant, who help him to defeat the ogres. This game is the first part of the story, and is divided into two large chapters, the first telling the story of the dog Ringo, the second the story of the monkey Matsunosuke. [CR]In this adventure, you interact with the world by selecting various commands from a menu. Along with traditional commands such as "Look" or "Take" there are situation-specific commands, for example "Smell" for the dog. In certain places it is possible to move by navigating the character physically.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Heracles no Eikou 3: Kamigami no Chinmoku ("Glory of Heracles 3: Silence of the Gods") is the third game in Data East's Heracles no Eikou / Glory of Heracles series of turn-based RPGs that are built around Ancient Greek mythology. Kamigami no Chinmoku is the first game in the series to be released on the Super Famicom (the previous two were Famicom games). It would also eventually be rereleased on the Wii's Virtual Console.[CR]The game is best remembered for its plot, which was fairly unique for its time. Written by Kazushige Nojima (who would later go on to write Final Fantasy VII), the plot revolves around an amnesiac immortal (many years before Planescape: Torment or Lost Odyssey). Because of its plot, this is arguably the best known entry in the series, along with the more recent Glory of Heracles DS game, which is mainly based on this game.[CR]Kamigami no Chinmoku's gameplay is retained from the previous Heracles no Eikou game: combat is entirely directed through turn-based, menu-driven commands, as was common for JRPGs of the era.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The story is focused around discovering the main character's identity, as he wakes up without his memory. He discovers early on that he is effectively immortal: he cannot be badly hurt, and he is able to use this unique ability to perform actions others cannot. The protagonist eventually meets various Greek gods and other famous mythological figures in his quest to discover who he is.[CR]					</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Heracles no Eikou IV: Kamigami kara no Okurimono ("Glory of Heracles IV: Gift from the Gods") is an Ancient Greek-themed RPG from Data East and the fourth (technically fifth, including the Game Boy spin-off Heracles no Eikou: Ugokidashita Kamigami) installment in their Heracles no Eikou series.[CR]It features a player-named young man who has his spirit separated from his body. He can use his spirit form to possess creatures and other people, using this mechanic to solve puzzles to make progress. The game incorporates various Ancient Greek myths and characters into its scenarios.[CR]Like the previous games in the series, the game was never localized into English. After this game, the Heracles no Eikou series went quiet for several years. Paon Corporation (who presently own a lot of Data East's properties after that developer went defunct) would eventually release a NDS sequel, Glory of Heracles, as well as add this game to the Wii's Virtual Console in 2008, and again to the Wii U's Virtual Console in 2015.[CR]					</plot>

The game was developed originally for the PC-9801 computer in 1992 and was then ported to the Super Famicom in 1994.[CR]The story concerns the young Crown Prince Richard A. McIntyre (who would eventually be known as the Scarlet King) who is chased from his home by demons. He meets a dryad spirit who bestows to him the ability to summon and control monsters and other creatures, and Prince Richard uses this power to raise an army to take back his castle.[CR]The Super Famicom is one of a handful to use the SNES Mouse peripheral as many of its mechanics depend on mouse control. It was never officially released or localized in the West, but a fan translation from prolific translators Aeon Genesis was completed in 2005.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Karaoke Mode[CR]At the title screen enter the code below to access a karaoke version for Ivanhoe's Theme (boss of level 5)</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Hiryu no Ken S: Golden Fighter is the first game in the Hiryu no Ken/Flying Dragon series to be released on the Super Nintendo. Rather than "Super", the S in the title actually stands for Special.[CR]The game contains a single-player mode which works like a Final Fight type brawler, only without the freedom to move up and down the screen. This mode has intermittent boss encounters which play out like Street Fighter one-on-one fights. There is also a versus mode for up to two human players that features a plethora of characters that do not appear in the story.[CR]The game was later rereleased as Hiryu no Ken S: Hyper Version. Though largely the same game as Golden Fighter, it received a few performance and gameplay tweaks as well as new enemy placement for the single player mode. This updated version would be released in the US as Ultimate Fighter.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Human Baseball is a baseball game released exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom. It features team logos from the Nippon Professional Baseball league, with the mascots from each team appearing in the background on the team select screen. The game uses Mode 7 to present the field stretching out from behind the batter, allowing the player to see far into the distance. It also includes a mini-map of sorts of the baseball diamond that makes it easier for the batting player to figure out who is on which base.[CR]As well as crediting Human Entertainment, the title screen features a credit from Field, an obscure developer that helped Human develop the game in some capacity.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Human Grand Prix III: F1 Triple Battle is a Formula One racing game for the Super Famicom. It is the third of four Human Grand Prix games for the system. It has the licenses of FOCA and Fuji TV: the former allows the game to use actual driver/team names while the latter is the official Japanese TV carrier of the Formula One races. Like its precedents, F1 Triple Battle uses Mode 7 and a low perspective for its racing.[CR]Unlike the previous two games in the franchise, this game only saw release in Japan; though all text in game is in English.Teams/DriversTeamDriversWilliamsDamon HillDavid CoulthardTyrrellUkyo KatayamaMark BlundellBennettonMichael SchumacherJJ LehtoMcLarenMika H&#228;kkinenMartin BrundleArrowsChristian FittipaldiGianni MorbidelliLotusAlex ZanardiJohnny HerbertJordanRubens BarrichelloEddie IrvineLarrousseOlivier BerettaErik ComasMinardiPierluigi MartiniMichele AlboretoLigierEric BernardOlivier PanisFerrariJean AlesiGerhard BergerSauberKarl WendlingerHeinz-Herald Frentzen[CR]	</plot>

			<title_clean>Idea no Hi</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Idea no Hi ("Day of the Idea") is a surreal turn-based JRPG from Office Kukan and Shouei System. The manga artist Koji Aihara penned the story and worked on the character design. The protagonist is a player-named boy who escapes from a laboratory after awakening to his psychokinetic powers. His quest takes him across a dystopian world, picking up allies along the way.[CR]The game has a few novel ideas, like allowing the protagonist to crossdress (which changes their profile picture) or wear underwear on his head, the latter of which results in people treating him like a pervert, which has a few beneficial side-effects. The protagonist has a "limit break" style attack when low on health, and the game has a day/night cycle.[CR]Koji Aihara also worked on the 1992 JRPG Maka Maka (also by Office Koukan). His satirical and bizarre touches permeate Idea no Hi as well.[CR]	</plot>

			<plot>The best scientists in the world have been working for years on the Subspace Particle Transfer Project, a process that uses subspace transporters to dematerialize an object, then instantly rematerializes it at another location. Short distance transfers of individuals have also been successful, and the scientists were about to begin long-range transport experiments.However, contactwith the research laboratory has been lost. Someone - or something - has taken over the facility and shut down all outside communications. There is no information about the intruders or their capabilities... no one has entered the facility and returned to tell about it. Plans for a final assault have been prepared and if it fails, there will be no choice but to destroy the entire installation. Agent Logan, who has been fitted with bioelectronic implants that give him superior strength, reflexes, and anlystical abilities, has been briefed on all aspects of the mission. Now it's up to him to infiltrate the lab, neutralize the intruders, and rescure the scientists.</plot>

			<plot>Iron commando is a brawler beat-em-up like Final Fight or Streets of Rage with lots of weapons and big end bosses.[CR]The B-movie story is cheesy and does nothing more than accommodate for the action. From the introduction sequence: "The peril came from outer space. A meteorite entered the earth's atmosphere bringing chaos. After observation, the scientists found that the meteorite was radioactive and had to be destroyed. Unfortunately, terrorists from g.h.o.s.t. want the meteorite too. The Iron Commando's mission is to retrieve the deadly body and avoid genetic mutation."[CR]The player or players walk along the levels beating up enemies. On some levels you ride a motorcycle or jeep, even a mine kart, and shoot your way through hordes of enemies. There are several end bosses, some are screen filling like a helicopter and a giant robot.[CR]Some enemies will drop food, grenades or weapons as you beat them into a bloody pulp. There are lots of different Weapons: 9mm guns, shotguns, machine guns, knives, baseball bats. The weird thing is, enemies that use a sword and even dogs will occasionally drop a machine gun or baseball bat.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Itadaki Street 2: Neon Sign wa Bara Iro ni ("Top Street 2: Rose-Colored Neon Sign") is a multiplayer board game adaptation that plays similarly to Monopoly. Players make their way around the board, buying properties and returning to the start point after passing through four integral points around the board shaped like playing card suits. There are multiple boards to choose from, each of which has a different shape and is increasingly larger and more elaborate than the last.[CR]Itadaki Street 2 is the second game in the Itadaki Street series and the first (and only) for the Super Famicom. It was also the first game in the series to be published by Enix. While the series had yet to feature characters from Enix's Dragon Quest, it does feature a board that is shaped like a Dragon Quest Slime.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]J-League Soccer: Prime Goal is a soccer game based on the J-League, Japan's premier soccer league. It uses a horizontally scrolling soccer pitch that occasionally cuts to cinematic animations for challenges and after a goal is scored. The player has the choice of ten teams in the J League, each with the real-life members of each team (at the time).[CR]The game was followed with two more sequels for the Super Famicom: J-League Soccer: Prime Goal 2 and J-League Soccer: Prime Goal 3. The third game is the only one to be released outside of Japan, as 90 Minutes: European Prime Goal.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]J-League Soccer: Prime Goal 2 is a video game licensed by J-League, published by Namco. It is the second game in the J-League Soccer Prime Goal series, preceded by J-League Soccer: Prime Goal and succeeded by 90 Minutes: European Prime Goal. Prime Goal 2 was released on August 5, 1994 only in Japan for the Super Famicom.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Prime Goal 2 has all of the features of a traditional soccer game.[CR]Prime Goal 2 is similar to other top-down soccer simulators of the time. The player controls a single team member at a time. When in possession of the ball, the player will always control that team member, but otherwise the controlled team member can be switched with the press of a button. Control is automatically swapped when the player's character is off-screen, or when the ball begins to approach a different team member.[CR]Other than running around, shooting, passing, and slide-tackling, the player has control over several other actions. Naturally, there are throw ins (the player can select which team member to throw the ball to), goal kicks (where the player controls the distance the ball is kicked), fouls (referees even dole out yellow and red cards), and occasionally a one-on-one minigame. In this one-on-one game the player can either manage to relinquish control of the ball from the opponent, or have the opponent jump over the player (depending on the player's button inputs).[CR]Of note are the variety of modes that are offered in Prime Goal 2. Naturally, there is a player vs. computer and player vs. player mode, but also included are a campaign mode (complete with a password system), a penalty kick mode, and an "east vs. west" mode where the player is able to consolidate members from several teams into one, customized team.[CR][B]Teams:[/B][CR]The game's twelve teams.Kashima AntlersJEF UnitedShonan BellmareShimizu S-PulseUrawa Red DiamondsVerdy YomiuriJ&#250;bilo IwataNagoya Grampus EightYokohama F.

			<title_clean>Jaleco Rally Big Run - The Supreme 4WD Challenge</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Jaleco Rally: Big Run: The Supreme 4WD Challenge is a rally racing game and sim in which the player takes part in the Paris-Dakar rally. The game actually begins in Tripoli, Libya and passes through around 2,500 miles of African desert, swamp and jungle on the way to Dakar.[CR]Jaleco originally developed the game for the Arcades before porting it to the Super Famicom. This home version was never released outside of Japan. The game was also ported to the Amiga and Atari ST, where it is known simply as Big Run.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In addition to passing each checkpoint under the required time - the checkpoint system ubiquitous in solo racing games of the era - the player must also be aware of environmental dangers along the course and needs to select a sponsor, navigator and engineer team before starting. They must also balance the weight of their car, as too few replacement parts might cause a problem further into the race yet having too many will greatly reduce the car's top speed.</plot>

			<plot>Marine and his friends went out for a day of fun at the Jelly Land Amusment Park. It was a fun day, lots of laughs. It was a real riot until a mysterious jester showed up. The Jester changed Marine and his friends into puddles of slime. Now Marine must find his way through the Jelly Land Amusment Park to find his friends, so they can battle the Jester and break his curse.[CR]Along the way, you'll travel through eight worlds. The player has some choice in the order to play the levels through. As you play, you'll rescue Marine's friends. Each of them has a special talent, which will enable you to find your way through various puzzles, in order to find all the secrets. Most of the levels are pretty easy, but the bosses will present a decent challenge trying to defeat.[CR]This game is the unreleased sequel to the platformer game Jerry Boy.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]KingMike presents a 100% complete translation of Jelly Boy 2. It is available in both IPS and NINJA patch format. KingMIke notes that this ROM WILL have a bad checksum, since it's a prototype game. Patch with the NINJA version and it's impossible to patch the wrong ROM.[CR]Chris Covell did this translation. He was also responsible for a translation of this game's prequel, Jerry Boy.[CR]Reviewer: KingMike[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/1062/</plot>

			<plot>This game came out in the US, but under the name Smart Ball. So why translate it? Well, pretty much the whole story was cut out in the US release, such as the intro and towns, which is a damn shame, considering the game makes a hell of alot more sense with them in it. You play the part of a guy who rules a kingdom with his brother, which is going along just fine until you decide to marry this princess. Unfortunatly, your brother gets pissed off, (I guess he can't find his own woman or something.), and lets some mysterious wizard guy turn you into an amorphous slime ball so he can take your girlfriend, and rule the kingdom by himself. Naturally you must beat the wizard and your brother's ass, and with your super secret slime powers, you have a chance. Not only can you jump, turn into a phallic looking glob, and climb walls, but you can also find little balls to shoot at crap. I guess it's a good thing the wizard didn't just kill you instead of giving you all these abilities, but then there'd be no game, huh?[CR]I've always considered myself to be really good at platformers, but this game had me ripping my hair out at certain parts. At first I thought it'd be a walk in the park, but no, some of the levels are really damn tricky (Not Dragon's Lair for NES tricky, but then again, I don't think anything's that hard, except maybe Battle Toads.), even sadistic at times. Despite the difficulty, it's a really fun game, and definitly worth a spin on your SNES emulator of choice, especially if you've played Smart Ball and want to see what all you missed out on.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]This is Chris Covell's first translation project, and it turned out pretty well I think. There were a couple of graphic bugs in the original game that he fixed as well.[CR]Reviewer: Silver X[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/372/</plot>

			<plot>The third in the Paroidus series, it's the same gameplay and zaniness that substantiated the first two games. Gameplay itself is a copy (a parody rather) of Konami's famous Gradius series in that the screen scrolls from left to right (most times) and you maneuver around the screen destroying waves of enemies and avoiding obstacles. Unlike previous Parodius titles, this game contains a difficulty adjustment option, allowing the player to make things easier... or harder. Also unique to this parodius title is a bit of japanese digital voice that shouts out various things at you while you play. Survival throughout the level earns you a boss fight, which frequently includes some of the strangest characters in the game. Make no mistake, this *is* Gradius,  but with all sorts of strange graphics, music and references to other Konami games... So in other words, it's Parodius![CR]There are now more power-ups than ever including the standard power-up (red, used to upgrade weapons), the shield power-up (blue) and a variety of different coloured bells. Green Bells will make you huge on the screen, Yellow Bells are worth points (points in turn are worth extra lives),  Blue Bells are "big bombs" that clear the screen of enemies/shots and can be saved until you need them, White Bells will give your character a megaphone that will shout out japanese phrases, the characters of the phrases themselves can be used to damage enemies (the power of words!), The Red Bell stockpiles you with three point-defense lasers... only one of which can be activated at a time and disappear after a short while. Finally the purple bell will clear the screen of all but the strongest enemies... and will turn them into power-ups.[CR]This time around there are 16 different characters to chose from and the power-ups and weapons that they use are more unique than ever. Several familiar "faces" return and they've brought along friends to share in the party:[CR]Vic Viper: The "gradius ship" appears once again in this gradius parody, equipped with it's traditional gradius weapons[CR]2. Lord British: The "other" Gradius ship and arguably the more famous of the two. Lord British has weapons similar to Vic but quite different also.Missiles and shields work differently for instance. And Lord British uses a Ripple gun instead of a double shot.[CR]3. Pentaro: It just wouldn't be a Parodius game if Pentaro wasn't involved. Originally from Konami's Penguin Adventure, Pentaro retains the same abilities from previous Parodius games... however his Potion weapon may now hit multiple enemies and his normal weapon shots explode against obstacles[CR]4. Hanako: Also from Penguin Adventure, Hanako the penguin is Pentaro's girlfriend. While Pentaro is blue, she is the red penguin. She plays nearly identical to Pentaro with the exception of her S. Bomb weapon[CR]5. Twinbee: Twinbee, from the Twinbee games is another returning Parodius star. Unfortunately he hasn't been upgraded since previous games, so his weapons are nearly identical; Punching Glove Rocket and all...[CR]6. Winbee: Winbee, also from Twinbee is red and has moves identical to Twinbee, except for one difference... when she has 3 Options available, she can power them up to harm enemies that touch them.[CR]7. Tako: Again, it just wouldn't be a parodius game without a flying octopus. And here he is, still wearing a baseball cap, but otherwise unchanged from previous Parodius games.[CR]8. Belial: A yellow female octopus with a bow in her hair, she is identical to Tako with the exception of her Missile and Double weapons... which are instead identical to the Vic Viper.[CR]9. Soitsu: A stickman (now green) surfing aboard a paper airplane, Soitsu plays similar to Koitsu from the previous game, aside from his colour. His laser weapon is able to charge up to deliver more power and he drops little stickmen onto the ground which occasionally dance around rather than attacking. Additionally he has an "upgrade power" (S. Power) that make all his other abilities stronger[CR]10. Doitsu: Similar to Soitsu but with a Double Laser ability. He is an orange stickman riding on a paper airplane and no "upgrade" power, using normal options instead[CR]11. Upa: Upa aka The Flying Baby is back from the previous Parodius game (as well as his original game, Bokutte Upa) and plays nearly the same. Instead of a shield, he has a Mega Crush power that damages all on-screen enemies... and also has an "Upgrade Power" in the form of Grade Up that makes his other abilities stronger.[CR]12. Rupa: Another flying baby (presumably also from Bokutte Upa), Rupa plays similar tot Upa but with a Multi Spread gun which fires missiles in multiple directions (with each upgrade) and a S.Vulcan gun which automatically aims towards enemies.[CR]13. Mike: A cute little kitten who happens to to have a very powerful wave weapon which can travel through obstacles and enemies. Additionally he has a multiple bomb ability which requires his "upgrade ability" (Grade Up) to get really powerful[CR]14. Rani: Another cute kitten (this one rolled onto his bottom facing forward) with very power weaponry. Some of the highlights include a Reflect weapon wherein the shots bounce off of obstacles. Another is the S laser which travels forward but then homes in Up or Down to hit the enemy. And finally, Rani's missile weapon is two homing bells. Rani also has an "upgrade ability" in the form of Grade Up, however it only upgrades the Reflect Shot.[CR]15. Memim: One of the fairy characters, Memim is a female flying girl with standard female bikini clothing. She carries some unique missile weapons however, whose direction is determined by Memim's current location on the screen when fired.[CR]16. Sue: The other fairy with tight clothing, Sue is unique in that her weapons are upgraded/displayed in a different order from everybody else's in the game. For instance her Option is the 4th weapon on the list rather than the 6th... requiring less power-ups to activate it. However aside from that... all of her weapons are the exact same as the Vic Viper's.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Ingame Codes[CR]While playing, pause the game and press the following buttons:[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Ingame Codes[CR]At the Options Menu #1, press the following buttons:*Note: The Round and Stage Select cheats have to be entered in Option Menu #1, but they will appear in Option Menu #2.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Credit Bonuses[CR]After beating the last boss, if the hundreds number in your highest score is one of the following denominations, a different character will appear at the start of the credits. *Note: this will only appear by beating the game in Round/Loop 2 or above.</plot>

As the name implies this is a wrestling game in which wrestlers from different leagues collide in grappling contests to determine who's the king of the hill.[CR]Select your character with his unique stats and movesets, and go at it against any opponent from four fictional leagues with dozens of moves, submission holds and rope maneuvers in or out of the ring.[CR]The game uses pre-rendered 2D sprites and features Vs, Tournament, and League play for up to four players. Also included is a career mode where you create a wrestler and control each aspect of his career up to his final victory in the inter-league tournament. And you can also configure matches to be standard, tag (with 4 or 6 wrestlers), submission or death-matches which adds such features as live wires and explosives to the ring.</plot>

As well as the usual exhibition and pennant modes, the player can practice any position in the game (batting, pitching, fielding) with any team member.[CR]As with most games in the Power Pro series, Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu '94 was never released outside of Japan.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR]Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 3 is the third major game in the Powerful Pro series. This game was released on February 29, 1996 for the Super Famicom only in Japan by Konami. The game was developed by Diamond Head, a developer behind many Jikkyou Powerful Pro games. Powerful Pro 3 is a traditional baseball simulator, in the "super deformed" or "chibi" style that makes the franchise well-known.  The game is fairly similar to its predecessors, Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu '94 and Jikkyou Powerful Pro Yakyuu 2, although it does add some new features, such as Success Mode. Success Mode is an RPG-esque mode where players develop a baseball player, guiding them through situations and forming them into a "powerful pro." [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR] Pitching and batting are done from the same angle.     At its core, Powerful Pro 3 is a traditional baseball simulator. There are a variety of modes to play in, allowing players to either play versus a second player, a computer, or pit two computers against each other. Players control pitching, batting, and fielding, as well as some organization due to the wealth of customization options.  During pitching, players can move the directional pad to influence the throw. It must stay within a box to be a strike, as throwing outside of the box makes it a ball. During batting, players can either bunt or swing, controlling the location where the batter swings. In fielding, players control a single player at a time, switching manually or automatically (depending on the location of the ball).  Yakyuu 3 introduced "Success Mode."     There are several other modes than the traditional baseball modes. Players can practice batting, pitching, fielding, and play practice games. There is a wide variety of customization options, particularly in terms of players and teams.   The real draw of the Powerful Pro series is the Success Mode, which was started with this game. It puts the player in control of a pre-made character who the player must develop into a powerful athlete. This is done by guiding the player through situations, making decisions, etc. As a more "role-playing game"-esque part of the game, this actually provides players with multiple save slots and options.    </plot>

The game is similar to Fire Emblem, in that the game is a strategy RPG where the strategy elements are far more pronounced than the RPG elements. Units are all generic troops, and each only goes up a level once they have killed ten units. The story focuses around the discovery and re-activation ancient weapons of war called the Letum (which resemble mechs), and creatures borne from trees to counter them called the Junei.[CR]The game was never released outside of Japan. It received a fan translation from the Aeon Genesis group in 2003.[CR]	</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kabuki Machi Reach Mahjong is a mahjong game created for the Super Famicom by obscure developer Studio Softmov. It would be the only game they ever develop. The game features an overworld map, allowing the player to move from location to location playing mahjong with various people. It features four-player mahjong, which became the norm in the 16-bit era (the 8-bit era often had to fall back to one-on-one games due to lack of computing power).[CR]	</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kabuki Rocks is a turn-based RPG that is heavily inspired by traditional Japanese Kabuki theater. Most of the characters and enemies are based on some aspect of Kabuki, including the wild-haired protagonist Rock. The game's equivalent of magic are songs learned at karaoke parlors performed on each character's musical instrument. Many other elements are based around performance arts, including a Paper Mario-esque "stage" backgrounds for random encounters.[CR]RED Entertainment were better known at the time for their Tengai Makyou series, which were being published by Hudson. For this game, which was published by Atlus instead, RED created a new universe that nonetheless feels mechanically similar to their Tengai Makyou games.[CR]The game was never released outside of Japan.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kamen Rider is a beat 'em up developed by Sun L and published by Bandai for the Super Famicom platform. It is based on the Kamen Rider tokusatsu TV show, specifically the very first incarnation which ran between 1971-1973. The player assumes the role of Takeshi Hongo, the first Kamen Rider, as he fights through the minions and kaijin (human-sized kaiju) of the evil organization Shocker in a series of brawler stages not unlike Final Fight or Double Dragon.[CR]The game can also be played co-operatively with a second player who plays as Hayato Ichimoto: the second Kamen Rider. At any time the two players can transform into their Kamen Rider personas, necessary for delivering the final blows on bosses.[CR]Kamen Rider was only released on the Super Famicom in Japan.[CR]	</plot>

			<plot>Kamen Rider SD: Shutsugeki!! Rider Machine brings together all ten showa era Kamen Riders to do motorcycle combat with an army of Shocker soldiers. Each Episode starts with an introduction by "Oyassan" Tachibana, and stars a different Rider with his own unique special move. Episodes are broken up into six levels of combat against several Shockers riding their own motorcycles or cars or other vehicles, followed by a boss battle in the seventh level. After levels 2 and 5 the Kamen Rider will repair any damage and be able to choose from one of 4 limited powerups, such as invincibility, super speed, or a machine gun. Most of the time Kamen Rider will defeat enemies by riding alongside them and punching them, and enemies will try to do the same to ram or shoot him.</plot>

In second room, do the same, but do NOT go to the next room.  About halfway through the room,  (after the first green moving block and fire pit) there will be a platform at the top with a magic restore potion.  To get there, the easiest way is to jump on the second green block as it moves toward you, and then use that to jump up to the platform.  When you get the potion, press and hold DOWN to crouch and then, while crouching, go to the right.  You will crawl through the wall and into a secret part of the room.  Going right will teleport you into a room with two enemies that crawl along the walls; you can either dodge them or kill them with magic.  The only exit to the room is in the upper left corner.  It will take you directly to the boss.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Caverns of Shirol shortcut[CR]NOTE: When you first enter the boss room, the health and magic bars will look like they have the max amount but are empty, and the lives and crystals will both be x99.  When you first get hit or use magic, however, everything will change back to normal.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kawa no Nushi Tsuri 2 ("Fishing the River Master 2") is a Japan-exclusive fishing RPG from Natsume and the third game in their long-running Nushi Tsuri/River King franchise. Like its predecessor, released on the Famicom in 1990, the game crosses fishing game elements such as finding bait and ideal fishing spots with RPG elements such as fighting wildlife in turn-based battles and growing more experienced over time. Cash and XP earned while fishing or roaming around contribute to the player's angling ability.[CR]The player can select one of four family members, a trademark of the series. Each character has slightly different goals, but they usually culminate in becoming a strong enough fisherperson to catch "the River King": a legendary freshwater fish.[CR]Though the game is labelled as Kawa no Nushi Tsuri 2, the second game in the series was actually the 1992 game Kawa no Nushi Tsuri: Shizenha for the PC Engine.</plot>

			<title_clean>Keeper</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Keeper is a top-down action puzzle game from Success (adapted for the Super Famicom by Fupac) that features a little forest creature (which resembles those in the movie My Neighbor Totoro) pushing colorful blocks around a grid to clear them.[CR]Keeper was originally released on the Japanese home computer Sharp X68000 in 1993 by Success and ASCII Corporation. It saw a Super Famicom port the year after, which was developed by Fupac and published by Datam Polystar. Finally, the game saw a PS1 rerelease in 2002 by Success and Fupac. The Super Famicom version was considered for a US localization (with the name CyberSlider and a complete graphical overhaul) which was ultimately canceled.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The goal is keep clearing blocks as they warp in, matching three or more blocks of the same color and/or symbol. Matching three blocks of the same symbol and color provides a much larger bonus to the player's score, and is the key to reaching the higher score ranks. The player character can hop on top of blocks to push those adjacent out of the way. The protagonist can push any number of blocks in a row at once, as long as there is a space behind. The outer border cannot hold blocks, but the player can use it to maneuver around the playing field easier.[CR]Eventually, the screen will fill with blocks and after a brief window to ensure no additional moves can be made, the game is over. The player is then rated based on their total score and number of cleared blocks, and given a rank. (Points are earned for every block removal, with bonuses for combos and same color/symbol matches.)

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kenyuu Densetsu Yaiba ("Legend of the Swordmaster Yaiba") is a video game adaptation of the anime and manga of the same name about the samurai youth Yaiba who is the latest incarnation of the Thunder God. The lighthearted manga/anime takes its inspiration from Japanese folklore, but transplants it into a modern setting.[CR]The game is an action RPG, where the protagonist fights monsters in real-time without transitioning to a separate battle screen. The game loosely follows the first arc of its source material, in which Yaiba must defeat his rival Onimaru and the various demons he summons (many of whom end up joining Yaiba's party after being defeated, becoming support characters). Yaiba has a number of AI support characters, including his faithful vulture companion Shonosuke, who will fly Yaiba back to the nearest safehouse for healing/saving. Others include Yaiba's love interest Sayaka, who can use cure magic to heal Yaiba, and Kagetora, Yaiba's tiger companion who fights alongside him. The game also has a two-player mode where the second player controls Rai; a character created for the game.[CR]Banpresto published Kenyuu Densetsu Yaiba for the Super Famicom, Game Boy and Sega Game Gear in 1994. The portable versions are side-scrolling action games, whereas the Super Famicom action RPG uses a top-down perspective.[CR]	</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kessen! Dokapon Okukoku IV: Densetsu no Yuusha Tachi ("Decisive Battle! Dokapon Kingdoms IV: Legend of Heroes") is a mix of an RPG and a multiplayer board game. Players move their heroes around the board, gaining levels and finding equipment, and eventually saving a kingdom from encroaching monsters. The goal is to beat the target monsters before the other players.[CR]Though the game includes a "IV" in its title, this actually refers to the number of players the game can support rather than being the fourth in the series. Kessen! Dokapon Okukoku IV is in actuality the very first Dokapon game. It was followed by Dokapon 3-2-1 and Dokapon Gaiden on the Super Famicom and BS Dokapon Gaiden: Hono no Audition for the Super Famicom's Satellaview.[CR]	</plot>

			<title_clean>Kidou Keisatsu Patlabor</title_clean>
			<plot>This is an RPG that was only released on the SNES, which also shares its name with several other titles across different systems, due to them all being based on the same Anime series "Patlabor".[CR]In this RPG, you control the two main pilots from the series/films, Noa Izumi and Isao Ota, as you complete your typical duties each day, helping to deal with rogue Labors (Mecha) and other such incidents. The game, only having been released in Japan, is only really advisable to play if you understand Japanese, as it really is a text-heavy game.[CR]The gameplay consists of three screens - a map of Japan, showing where your asignments are located, the "main" screen, where you control your Labor from a top-down viewpoint and maneuver it around the area of the crime. Finally, there's the combat screen, for when you press the action button to attack a rogue Labor. From here you can select one of various attacks; naturally, as the game goes on your pilots can learn new attacks, though unusually for an RPG there's also the option to just talk with the rogue Labor's pilot and try to convince them to back down - as a policeman, sometimes this is the only way forward.[CR]This is a fairly typical Eastern RPG with a fairly unique setting. Just don't forget your Kanji-English dictionary!</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kidou Senshi Gundam ("Mobile Suit Gundam") F91: Formula Senki 0122 is a strategy game based in the Gundam universe. Specifically, it follows the F91 series that chronologically takes place 30 years after the original. The F91 series began as a feature-length movie which summarized what would've been the first thirteen episodes of a longer TV show, and was released in March of 1991 - four months before this game.[CR]The aim of the game is to direct the player's Gundam and intercept enemy unit formations, and then line up individual targets in a space sim-like mode. After selecting a target in this mode, the player then selects between their Gundam's weapons (certain weapons do better depending on the player character's distance from the enemy) and watch the combat round unfurl. Upon destroying all nearby enemies, the player returns to the strategic mode to head towards the next set of units.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Battle on a bridge[CR]Pocky &amp; Rocky is an arcade style scrolling shooter with a top-down perspective for the Super Nintendo. Pocky &amp; Rocky was released in Japan in 1992 as Kiki Kaikai: Nazo no Kuro Manto ("Mysterious Ghost World: The Riddle of the Black Mantle") and globally as Pocky &amp; Rocky one year later in 1993. The game is the sequel to the Japan-only Arcade game KiKi KaiKai, which also saw a NES/Famicom spin-off. The protagonists in Pocky &amp; Rocky are a shinto shrine girl named Pocky (Sayo-chan in the original Japanese) and her good friend Rocky (Manuke), who is a tanooki, or raccoon dog. The names of these two characters obviously inspired the game's title. The game had two sequels, Pocky &amp; Rocky 2 on the SNES and Pocky &amp; Rocky with Becky on the Gameboy Advance.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Once upon a time in feudal Japan, Pocky is tending to the shrine at which she works on a dark, seemingly average night. She is visited at the shrine by Rocky the tanooki, and a number of insane nopino goblins, controlled by an unknown force. Pocky and Rocky jump into action, setting off on a journey across Japan, taking on mythical Japanese monsters. They eventually meet Black Mantle, who has been controlling these creatures, and defeats him, saving Japan and its people.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The gameplay is a classic top-down shooter style, where players view their character from a bird's eye view, and control their movement and aim where they shoot. The characters shoot enemies and obstacles, Pocky with cards, and Rocky with leaves. Both characters also have a close up attack (Pocky uses a wand, Rocky his tail) which hurts enemies and rebounds projectile attacks. Most enemies take one or two hits to be taken down, andThe first boss[CR]bosses are much tougher. Each player has life of their own, and they must avoid being hit, or else they will lose a life. The game begins giving players a set number of lives that, upon depletion, will result in a game over. Players receive points for good performance, and at certain score milestones, can gain additional lives.[CR]Both characters have special attacks which are used when the short range attack button is held. Pocky will spin, hurting all enemies surrounding her, and Rocky will become invulnerable upon turning into stone. Once per life, characters also have a super attack which will hit multiple enemies on the screen.[CR]Players can also perform a quick slide maneuver in order to move quickly across the stage, however, if players collide while sliding, they will spin out of control. This damages the player, but can also damage enemies while the characters spin.[CR]Power-up collectibles are scattered throughout the game's various levels, each of which provide a boost to the combat proficiency of both Pocky and Rocky. Some of the power ups will make their projectiles larger in size, make the player shoot more projectiles. There are also items which will recover life points or make the character invincible. Whenever a player collects an items, they will gain points for their feat.[CR]Pocky &amp; Rocky has three levels of difficulty: easy, normal, and hard. With each increase in difficulty, enemies become tougher and more numerous, and bosses will gain additional life. There is no reward for completing the game on harder levels.[CR]		</plot>

In Japan the game is known as Kiki Kaikai: Tsukiyozoushi (roughly, "Mysterious Ghost World: Tome of Moonlit Night"). Like the original Pocky &amp; Rocky (a.k.a. Kiki Kaikai: Nazo no Kuro Mantle), Pocky &amp; Rocky 2 was released in Japan, the US and Europe. Natsume published the game in the US and Japan, and the European release was handled by Ocean Software.[CR]The game's plot revolves around a kidnapped princess, abducted by demons led by a character named Impy. Pocky (Sayo in the Japanese version) can now be joined with various partners beyond just Rocky (Manuke). These include Bomber Bob (Takuan) and Little Ninja (Shinobi) from the offset, with the additional characters Tengy, Scarecrow, Digger and Ottobot unlocked as the game progresses. All partner characters can temporarily combine with Pocky when she casts her magic, each providing a different benefit.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Level Passwords[CR]If you're unfamiliar with Japanese characters, consult a hiragana chart while entering a password.

			<plot>Kikou Keisatsu Metal Jack is a scrolling brawler based on the anime of the same name. At the start of the game the player can choose from Red Jack, Silver Jack, or Blue Jack. Red and Silver both have weapons they can find ammo for in levels (a gun and baton, respectively), and all three can do a multiple hit combo or a jumping attack. At the end of a level the Jack will be met by his vehicle which will then merge with his armor. In this form the Jack's attacks are strengthened and he can charge up an attack that hits every enemy onscreen.[CR]There is no story told at any point in the game, so if you want to know what's going on you'll have to track down the anime.</plot>

			<title_clean>Kikuni Masahiko no Jantoushi Doraou</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Unleash your mahjong power!!![CR]Jantoushi Doraou is a simple mahjong game for the Super Famicom. It features a wide variety of strange and ridiculous characters and is largely comical in nature. It follows typical Japanese mahjong rules, although there are a few exceptions (mentioned below). Many characters are also capable of performing special attacks when their "cosmo" meter is full; these attacks can have many different incarnations, from simply beating the opponent unconscious for a win (surprisingly ineffective) to instantly getting a ron. The game also features a password feature which allows players to save their progress.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B].[CR]The player assumes the role of the titular Jantoushi Doraou, a master mahjong Saint who resides in Sanctuary and is committed to protecting the goddess Atenaide. Unfortunately, the villainous Mahjong warlock Jankou invades Sanctuary and seemingly kidnaps Atenaide! It's Doraou's duty to rescue her from the clutches of this fiend, and he sets off on a journey to gather the other Mahjong Saints and journey to Jankou's castle to rescue her. This journey winds through a number of towers with guardians based on the Chinese Zodiac; this is a direct parody of Saint Seiya, where the Gold Saints are based off of the Greco-Roman zodiac.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Designed by the manga artist Masahiko Kikuni, the frequently ridiculous characters are the real strength of the game, and it features quite a few. Many of them have special abilities or have certain play habits. Some characters will occasionally ask the player if they can draw an extra tile or if the player wants to take a coffee break. Player characters learn new special attacks as they progress in the game. As a note on special attacks: most of them deal damage in addition to having a specific effect.[CR]Doraou: The player character. He seems to be somewhat out of it at times, but is truly a master of mahjong. He was originally a high-school student named Kentarou. He learns a large number of special attacks during the course of the game, with many different effects:Pegasus ryuukyokuken: Pummel the opponent mercilessly until they get irritated, ending the round no matter what is in anyone's hand.Rolling pai: replaces the player's and opponent's current hands with new hands at the beginning of the round.Aurora sword: changes all of the player's tiles to a randomly determined color/suit.Rozan shosuushii: virtually gives Doraou a suushiihou (&#22235;&#21916;&#21644;) a set including 3 of each of the four winds, setting him up for an astronomical win!Tenhou rinin: Gives Doraou a tenhou (&#22825;&#21644;) meaning a "heaven hand". Victory![CR]Li Pai: A pretty girl who is a little sadistic, she is the person who trained Doraou and is still a protector of Atenaide. She runs off near the beginning of the game but is encountered several times later. Her kiss makes the player's tiles magically order themselves, but it wears off after a period of time! Unfortunately she never joins the player's party. Her name is a reference to "&#29702;&#29260;", or "riipai", which is to arrange the tiles in a hand.[CR]The Goddess Atenaide: A mahjong goddess, it is the duty of the mahjong saints to protect her. She is seemingly kidnapped near the beginning of the game, but not all is as it seems... her name is a pun on "exposure".[CR]Pinzu Tanki: The first of the other saints the player recruits, he is a parody of Bruce Lee. He is obsessed with katsudon for reasons that are unclear.Pinzu dust: For one turn, Tanki can declare a tsumo using only pinzu (&#31570;&#23376;), the suit that looks like a series of dots.Piranha pinzu: For one turn, the opponent can only declare tsumo using pinzu pieces.Demon pinzu: Changes all of the player's tiles to pinzu tiles.[CR]Manzu Sally: The second mahjong saint recruited. She is a sort of "big sister" figure, and is one of the more sensible characters in the game.Red needle: For one turn, Sally can declare a tsumo using only manzu (&#33836;&#23376;) the suit that is a series of kanji numbers.Sekisho kumeisaiha: For one turn, the opponent can only declare tsumo using manzu pieces.Red bomber: Changes all of the player's tiles to manzu tiles.[CR]Souzu Shiryu: The last of the mahjong saints who were supposed to protect Atenaide that the player recruits. He acts cool and collected. He is apparently a homosexual.Green pulse: For one turn, Shiryu can declare a tsumo using only souzu ( &#32034;&#23376;) the suit that is a composed of bamboo.Blood souzu: For one turn, the opponent can only declare tsumo using souzu pieces.Rozan ryuuiisou: Changes all of the player's tiles to souzu tiles.[CR]Muu-san: A mysterious and silly looking old man who is in charge of the coliseum and Galaxian Wars. He provides the player with passwords and other useful information. He is simply named after Muu from Saint Seiya. He eventually joins the party!Galaxy riichi: For one turn, if the player declares riichi and draws a winning tile, they get a 10,000 point bonus.Galaxian triple bomber: Changes Muu's hand to a virtual daisangen (&#22823;&#19977;&#20803;) giving him several pieces of each of the "dragons"(the three elements) setting him up for a potentially huge win![CR]Roushi : The old master mahjong player. He is secretly a master mahjong saint. He currently lives in retirement in Chinatown. He too joins the player's party near the end of the game.Houou genmahou: Lets the player see the tiles in the opponent's hand.Kokushiken: Changes Roushi's hand to a virtual kokushimusou (&#22269;&#22763;&#28961;&#21452;) setting him up for a potentially huge win![CR]Inazuma Shun: The first opponent of the Galaxian Wars in the coliseum. He thinks he's cool, but doesn't have the proper patience for mahjong and mostly tries for easy hands.Sekisho kumeisaiha: For one turn, Shun's opponent can only declare tsumo using manzu pieces.[CR]Pinfu Bravo: A transvestite entrant from the Galaxian Wars. He takes advantage of his large man-hands in efforts to cheat. "Pinfu", meaning "peace", is a particular winning hand.Blood souzu: For one turn, Bravo's opponent can only declare tsumo using souzu pieces.[CR]Baba Puutaro: A rastafarian bum who lives in a garbage can. He is the strongest competitor in the Galaxian Wars. He hopes to be rehabilitated from unspecified personal issues via a big win.Piranha pinzu: For one turn, Puutaro's opponent can only declare tsumo using pinzu pieces.[CR]Jun-chan: The first of Roushi's students in Chinatown. She is a martial artist in addition to a mahjong player. She only allows the player 5 seconds to decide their action, so be prepared![CR]Kandra Julian: Another of Roushi's students, she is an American. She apparently has a genius for mahjong. She always wins in a tie for some reason. Her name is a pun on the special kandora rule which causes additional dora indicators to be flipped whenever anyone declares a kan.[CR]Shan: A cat girl, she is the de-facto guardian of the rat tower by virtue of the fact that she ate the original guardian. She likes all of the simple number-based tiles.[CR]Cowpon: The idiotic guardian of the Bison tower. Despite his inability to speak sensibly and tendency to drool, he is capable of playing mahjong. Indeed, he is very skillful at getting tenpai (a hand that requires only one tile to win) so pay very close attention to what he's discarding and play it safe!Great ron: Cowpon gets a score bonus if he declares ron in the same round he performs this move.[CR]Tigger: No, he doesn't like bouncing. But he DOES like mahjong! He is a big fan of the Hanshin Tigers, and is also fond of declaring "riichi" (reach) in an effort to get that last tile for victory. Needless to say, he's the guardian of the tiger tower.Galaxy riichi: For one turn, if Tigger declares riichi and draws a winning tile, he gets a 10,000 point bonus.Houou genmahou: Lets Tigger see the player's tiles![CR]Bunny Boy: The guardian of the rabbit tower. He likes a good cigar and a drink now and then. Jankou has tricked him in to working for him. He is a straightforward strong player, and apparently takes note of the player's playing tendencies.Galaxian triple bomber: Changes Bunny Boy's hand to a virtual daisangen (&#22823;&#19977;&#20803;) giving him several pieces of each of the "dragons"(the three elements) setting him up for a potentially huge win![CR]D.D. King: A dragon and top-notch blues guitarist who guards the dragon tower. He's a jovial and talkative player. He possesses a powerful attack skill, so be ready!Rozan ryuuiisou: Changes all of D.D. King's tiles to souzu tiles.[CR]Snake Dancer: The guardian of the snake tower. Apparently she is a cheater and a master of sleight-of-hand. She never declares "riichi" in hopes of throwing her opponent off.[CR]Batarou: The guardian of the horse tower. He is completely oblivious to the horse on his head. Apparently the horse is always horny because it's cut off from the world.Demon Pinzu: Changes all of Batarou's tiles to pinzu tiles.[CR]Ram-chan: The guardian of the sheep tower. She is very self-conscious about her body hair and thinks everyone is always trying to see her naked. She often tries hanchan and penchan (put in the simplest manner, she will often wait for key numbered pieces to complete long numerical "straights") Her name is a parody of Lum from the classic anime and manga franchise Urusei Yatsura.Red Bomber: Changes all of Ram-chan's tiles to manzu tiles.[CR]Sarutol: The guardian of the monkey tower. It seems like a regular monkey (that can play mahjong) but he has a time bomb, rendering him extremely dangerous. Defeat him ASAP.Chiihourinne: Gives Sarutol a chihou (&#22320;&#21644;).[CR]Chicken George Washington: He hates lies and loves fried chicken. He also loves high speed mahjong, and he applies a three second time limit on all decisions! He calls pon and chii frequently, and often goes for the dora bonus. He is (obviously) the guardian of the chicken tower.[CR]Meiken John: Jankou's spooky zombie dog. It died in a traffic accident, but he returned it to life (or unlife?) Now it's the guardian of the dog tower.Kokushiken: Changes John's hand to a virtual kokushimusou (&#22269;&#22763;&#28961;&#21452;) setting him up for a potentially huge win![CR]Uririn: The guardian of the boar tower, he is brutish, ugly, and stupid. He is an average player, but he can drain the player's cosmo power!Cosmo Drain: Uririn drains his opponent's cosmo, preventing them from using special moves![CR]Jankou: The dark wizard of mahjong, behind all the events in the game. He has mastery over the dark mahjong arts, and is not afraid to use everything at his disposal to win. In reality he's not a bad guy; Atenaide bullied him in to kidnapping her because she really dislikes all of the protagonists and wanted to move out, but she didn't want to hurt their feelings by telling them she thinks they're a bunch of losers.Galaxian triple bomber: Changes Jankou's hand to a virtual daisangen (&#22823;&#19977;&#20803;) giving him several pieces of each of the "dragons"(the three elements) setting him up for a potentially huge win!Kokushiken: Changes Jankou's hand to a virtual kokushimusou (&#22269;&#22763;&#28961;&#21452;) setting him up for a potentially huge win!Gives Jankou a chiihou (&#22320;&#21644;).Nine Senses: Gives Jankou a chuurenpoutou (&#20061;&#34030;&#23453;&#29128;).</plot>

			<title_clean>King of Dragons, The</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The King of Dragons is a side scrolling fantasy hack-and-slash brawler. At the start of the game up to two players can choose from five character classes which include an Elf, Wizard, Fighter, Cleric or a Dwarf, using the original D&amp;D Edition ruleset that categorized Elves and Dwarves as separate classes. Each class gets an upgraded weapon or armor every couple of levels. The player(s) can fight through hordes of goblins, skeletons, fish people and more, and at the end of each level there is an encounter with a boss creature.[CR]The King of Dragons was ported to the Super Nintendo in 1994 for the US, Japan and Europe. This port was developed by the nascent Prism Kikaku, which had split off from SunSoft the year previously. Prism Kikaku would change their name in 1995 to Nippon Ichi Software.[CR]		</plot>

			<title_clean>King of the Monsters 2 - The Next Thing</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]King of the Monsters 2: The Next Thing is a kaiju brawler and the sequel to King of the Monsters. Instead of being a standard one-on-one fighter, the player as one of three giant superheroes must move across the stage fighting numerous enemies. SNK originally developed the game for both the home and Arcade Neo Geo, and Takara would port the game to the Super Nintendo and Genesis.[CR]The Genesis game is quite a bit different from the SNES and Neo Geo versions, returning to a one-on-one Fighter like the previous King of the Monsters.[CR]Players can fight against computer opponents in a standard story mode beat 'em up in either single-player or multiplayer co-operative, or they can fight each other.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]In the year 1996 monsters started showing up all over the world. These monsters were powerful creatures who were waging a fierce war against each other, and destroying the world in the process. The people of the planet could only watch on for three years as these monsters were destroying everything. The battle waged on until only the three strongest monsters were left standing.[CR]At last in 1999 a new group of monsters showed up to challenge for control of the planet. These new monsters would battle the previous ones to see who would become the king of the monsters.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The mechanics of the game allow for basic punches and kicks, but the biggest damage comes from throws. When a player approaches a similarly sized opponent, this will result in the two grappling. The winner of the struggle throws his opponent. Against the computer, the grappling system is rather unbalanced and it is difficult to come out of a grapple victorious, especially against the later bosses of the game. Each stage of the game must be completed within a set time limit and every stage has a boss characters at the end.Playable CharactersAtomic Guy, a humanoid superhero resembling Ultraman.Cyber Woo, a robot that resembles a giant gorilla.Super Geon, a large reptilian mutant.Game ModesPlayer vs. computer - The single player story mode; a second player can join in.Two players vs. computer - Two players team up to cooperatively play through the story mode.Player 1 Vs. Player 2 - Works much like a one on one fighting game. The first player to win 3 out of 5 rounds is declared the winner.[CR][B]Endings:[/B][CR]In the SNES and Arcade version of King of the Monsters 2 there are two different possible endings. Once the final boss has been defeated, he will divide into many smaller versions of himself. If all of these small versions can be defeated in the time allotted the good ending will be shown. Failing to kill all of these miniatures in the time limit will result in the bad ending being shown.Bad EndingThe Earth shook wildly and everything upon it sank into the ground, the Earth then fell silent. There was finally peace on Earth, but at what price?Good EndingThe playable monsters exult in the good ending (Arcade version). The players chosen character shoots out of a volcano and up into the air. As the character is falling the screen freezes and the player is given a screen stating they are the king of the monsters, a point bonus of 100,000 is also given. The heroes have defeated the enemy from another world and now they are the strongest![CR]Sega Genesis Version[CR]TAKARA changed the gameplay when porting King of the Monsters 2: The Next Thing to the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. Instead of having beat-em-up mechanics, the game is a one-on-one fighter, returning to the gameplay of the original King of the Monsters.[CR]							</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kingyo Chuuihou! Tobidase! Game Gakuen ("Goldfish Warning! Leap Out! Game Academy!") is a multiplayer party game based on the Kingyo Chuuihou! (Goldfish Warning!) manga and anime. The anime is about a rich girl named Chitose who loses her fortune and is forced to enroll in a public rural school that accepts barnyard animals as students. The anime charts her attempts to refine/gentrify those around her, including her new best friend Wapiko (the pink-haired girl on the cover/title screen).[CR]The game allows for up to three players. Each "mini-game" is selected from a roulette, and players compete to earn 100 points the quickest. These mini-games can range from trivia contests to more action-oriented fare. Most mini-games have their own rules concerning gaining (and losing) points to pay attention to.[CR]Kingyo Chuuihou! Tobidase! Game Gakuen was released on the Super Famicom in 1994 and was never released outside of Japan. It is the only Kingyo Chuuihou game on the Super Famicom: the other two were created for the Nintendo Game Boy prior to this game.</plot>

			<plot>Once already Chiaki and her reluctant demon servant Zenki have saved the world from the forces of darkness, but apparently once is never enough. Chiaki has a vision of five cloaked figures and knows that only she and Zenki can stop them. At once they set off to track down the demon leaders.[CR]In Kishin Douji ZENKI: Battle Raiden the player takes the role of Zenki. At first, and occasionally through the game, Zenki will be in his powered down form where he can only punch, jump, and dash. After Chiaki recovers her bracelet, or regains her concentration, or whatever she needs to do at the time, she can transform Zenki into his powered up form. In this form Zenki deals more damage and has a much longer list of attacks that get added to as the game progresses, such as a pillar of energy, an electrified punch, and a dashing attack. By picking up scrolls Zenki can do a powerful Rudora attack to all enemies on screen, but this attack damages Zenki as well.[CR]To complete platforming levels Zenki will have to make it to the end of the level while occasionally finding hidden stone monuments that, when destroyed, will drop items as well as alter the level or remove obstacles, allowing Zenki to pass. After a stage's first platforming level is a midboss fight, and after the second platforming level is the boss fight proper.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Onigami Korinden Oni is the fifth game in Pandora Box/Banpresto's ONI series of RPGs based around Japanese folklore, specifically focusing on malevolent spirits (youkai) and demons (oni). Like its predecessors, all of which were Game Boy originals, Onigami Korinden Oni follows the story of a demon-hunting samurai in historical Japan as he is accosted by the forces of darkness.[CR]The game introduces the helper character: an NPC that joins the hero and helps them in combat, either by supplying extra damage or by healing the protagonist (similar to the helper NPCs of Final Fantasy Mystic Quest). All combat takes place on circular stages with theater-style backdrops, presenting each battle as if it was a Kabuki play.[CR]Onigami Korinden Oni was never released outside of Japan. It was followed with one other Super Famicom entry in 1996: Bakumatsu Korinden Oni.[CR]	</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Koushien 2 is the second game in Affect's Koushien series of high school baseball sims, and the first to be released on the Super Famicom. As with its predecessor, players assume the role of a high school baseball team competing with others in Japan's Koushien stadium. It follows the standard "behind the batter" perspective of Bases Loaded/RBI Baseball. As with many early baseball games, the player moves all fielders simultaneously after a hit, rather than whichever one is closest to the ball.[CR]Koushien 2 would be followed with two more Super Famicom sequels (Koushien 3 and Koushien 4) before the series would progress to the Sony PS1 with Koushien V.</plot>

Its sequel Koushien 4 would be the last Koushien game for the Super Famicom system: the series moved to PlayStation shortly after.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Koutetsu no Kishi ("Steel Knight") is a WW2 turn-based strategy game in which the player assumes the role of Fritz Kraemer, a prominent German Waffen-SS and Heer (army) officer. The player, as Kraemer, must succeed in various campaigns led by Nazi Germany just before and up until the end of the second World War.[CR]The game was originally released on the NEC PC-9801 by General Support and was ported to the Super Famicom two years later by Dual and Asmik Ace. The Super Famicom version was followed by two sequels: Koutetsu no Kishi 2: Sabaku no Rommel Shougun and Koutetsu no Kishi 3: Gekitotsu Europe Sensen. It was one of a handful of games to support the SNES Mouse peripheral.[CR]Possibly due to its focus on German WW2 campaigns, neither Koutetsu no Kishi nor its sequels were ever released outside of Japan.</plot>

They must help Rommel defeat the Allied forces in North Africa across a number of scenarios.[CR]Koutetsu no Kishi 2 is the second game in the Koutetsu no Kishi series, all of which depend on raising and deploying troops (especially tanks, the titular "steel knights") and sending them against enemy forces to take strategically vital territory.

			<plot>Another tournament rocks the streets around the Nekketsu High area, and you know Kunio and his gang aren't going to let an opportunity to prove how baddass they are pass them by.[CR]The tournament this time is an eating contest, and the game itself plays like a block-lining puzzle game in the grand tradition of Tetris and Puyo Puyo. You must line-up blocks  of the same type as they fall in the classic rectangular play area, clearing them before time runs up or they fill the entire screen. Features a 1P tournament mode, and a 2P competitive Vs mode in which you can chain blocks and send them to your opponent as "attacks" in hopes of causing him/her to lose.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] View Momozonos Hidden *Lover to Friend* Music Concert[CR]To view the hidden concert version of the BGM "Lover to Friend", select Omake Mode (bottom option) on the title screen. Then, scroll through the list of BGMs until you find Lover to Friend. Once highlighted, hold down Select+L+R, and press A-B-X-Y in that order while still holding down the other buttons. If done correctly, the screen will fade out and you'll be taken to a screen where Momozono will be standing in spotlight with stars in the sky. Now read the Japanese words and sing or hum along to her music.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kunio-kun no Dodge Ball da yo: Zenin Shuugo ("It's Kunio's Dodgeball: Assemble Everyone!") is a Kunio-kun dodgeball game and the sequel to the NES/Famicom game Super Dodge Ball. Kunio and his team competes with various other squads in unusual arenas, including one suspended on a net above a forest. The goal, as always, is for the player to take out the other team by hitting them with the dodgeball, and avoiding or catching the dodgeball when it is thrown back at them.[CR]Kunio-kun no Dodge Ball da yo: Zenin Shuugo is the second Super Famicom game featuring the Kunio characters; the first was the brawler Shodai: Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun. The next Kunio-kun dodgeball game was Super Dodge Ball for the Neo-Geo, which was also the final Kunio-kun game Technos Japan ever made.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Kyuuyaku Megami Tensei (Megami Tensei: The Old Testament) was released by Atlus for the Super Famicom in 1995 following the success of the Shin Megami Tensei games. Kyuuyaku contains remakes of the first two Megami Tensei games, featuring significant graphical improvements over their Famicom originals. Other additions include:2 entirely original introductory scenes.Save functionality, rather then the cumbersome password system of the original games.A new arranged soundtrack handled by renowned composer Hitoshi Sakimoto.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]When fighting a "BULL" that has the "BUG" test on his side, hold Down, Left, A, and B and choose to start auto-battle mode. The usual battle message which change to another Japanese phrase: "Cabu-chan begins debugging".[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]When the word "END" appears after the ending, wait 5 minutes and you'll start the second quest.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]After you finish the game, when the word "END" appears on the screen, press at the same time "A, B, Select, Start, Up, Left" on Controller 1, plus "A, B, Up, Right" on Controller 2. You'll get an extended ending with character profiles and some data regarding the enemies you've faced.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]In a town, stand in front of the building where the save/warp Totems are and enter the building while holding Up + Right + B + A on controller 2. If done right, you'll get a sound test menu instead of the save/warp menu.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]In any dungeon where you can use the Autopilot feature, set an autopilot checkpoint, walk a little, and then use the autopilot again to move back to the checkpoint. Before your character gets there, though, cancel his movement with B, and you won't engage random battles anymore as long as you remain in the same dungeon.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]When you get any kind of Jewel from a chest, if you trade it on Rag's Store right away (before opening another chest) and then go back to that same chest, it will be closed again, and will contain another Jewel. Ginza B2 is the best place to exploit this glitch, as there's a shop near a chest with an Emerald.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]To unlock the conditions to fight the true last boss and get the different endings, first defeat Bael in Bael's Castle and he'll turn into a frog. Take the frog and let him merge with Beelzebub in Beelzebub's Maze. They'll become Baal. Let Baal merge with Lucifer in Lucifer's Temple. If you fail to do all that, then the game will end prematurely when you beat Satan in Suzuki's Company and you'll get a bad ending. Now, if you followed the complete process, then you'll proceed to the real last boss (God). When you reach God, you'll have the option of fighting him for the 'good' ending or joining him for the 'bad' ending.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]If you use a Muscle Drink (health recovery item sold on shops) when your HP is full, you'll get a Max HP boost instead.</plot>

			<plot>Der Langrisser is a Strategy game, developed and published by NCS,which was released in Japan in 1995.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Codes[CR]During a battle, while highlighting an empty square[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Cloning Items[CR]This trick allows you to duplicate any item. (Even limited items such as Langrisser or Runestones). The limitation is that the cloned item will have to stay equipped.  [CR]To start, equip said character with desired item to clone. Beat a scenario. Save the game, and go back to the load menu.  [CR]Scenario Select back to a scenario where said character appears as a NPC.  [CR]You'll still have the item the character equipped in your inventory. This is the cloned item. Equip that item to whoever you want. This action will swap the cloned item with the real item. Now, once you start the scenario, the NPC will be holding the cloned item, and the real item will be equipped to whichever character you gave it to.  [CR]Once the NPC joins your party, the NPC will retain the cloned item.  [CR]Make sure you don't unequip the cloned item, or it will disappear. [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Cloning Items[CR]When a character class changes, he or she still retains any [CR]items equipped. You can use this to your advantage. For example, say your Elwin started as a Fighter.  [CR]Fighters can equip Speedboots, but Knights can't. If Elwin has speedboots equipped and class changes to SlvrKnt, he will still have the speedboots equipped, even though SlvrKnt cannot equip speedboots.  [CR](Hint: You can use this trick in conjunction with Runestones and Scout classes to equip ranged weapons.) [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Secret Scenarios[CR]Secret Scenario 1:[CR]On Scenario 6, place Elwin at the upper left corner of the map on the spot where the wall juts in a little bit more and kill all enemies. You will be given the option to investigate the Muscular Shrine. Say yes to access the secret level.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Secret Scenarios[CR]Secret Level 2 &amp; 3:[CR]On Scenario 8, place Elwin at the bottom right corner of the map where there is a small pool with a stick sticking out of it and kill all enemies. Depending on whether you're in the Light or Imperial path, you'll go to either Secret Scenario 2 or 3[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Secret Scenarios[CR]When saying ''No'' to ''Is this okay?'' during character creation, all stats are reset except starting Items. Doing this, you can obtain many items from the start of the game such as Devil axes, saleable for lots of P. Though after the 6th time, the game freezes. So don't get too greedy. </plot>

			<plot>1924, the town Newcam, Massachusetts. On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. [CR]This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...[CR]"Devil of Laplace" is a hybrid between survival horror and traditional Japanese RPG, similar to the pioneer of this genre,  Sweet Home for NES. Unlike "Sweet Home", this game has less puzzles and is more oriented towards RPG elements. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.</plot>

			<plot>"The Last Battle" for SNES is a RPG in which you control Kurt, a young apprentice magician who lives in Eldar village with his parents. He just turned sixteen, and on the day of his initiation he receives a task from the Great Magician Fehbennels: he has to go to a nearby cave and to retrieve a precious gem. When Kurt returns home, he meets an injured soldier from the Silver Castle. He says the castle was attacked by the army of the evil warlock Glud. The Great Magician Fehbennels sends Kurt to king Gustaf and the ruler of the Silver Castle, Lord Yuri. Kurt gets involved in a conflict between different nations, and meets the elven girl Mei and other companions on his quest to defeat the ultimate evil.[CR]The game is a Japanese-style RPG: you navigate Kurt and his party on the world map, visiting towns, descending into dungeons, and fighting random enemies and bosses. The battles are set in auto-mode and are a mixture of turn-based and real time styles. You can stop the flow of a battle by accessing a menu and assigning commands to your characters. The battles are viewed from a third-person perspective, and the characters move around the battle field automatically while performing their attacks. The characters can use physical attacks and a variety of offensive and defensive magic.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Leading Company is a corporate strategy simulation game from Koei, and part of their library of modern business "Executive" strategy games that also includes Aerobiz and Winning Post. It's based around 1970s and 1980s corporate culture, with the player assuming control of a corporation that researches and produces VCR and VHS electronics. The player's given a plot of land with which to expand their operation, and must balance income and growth.[CR]The game was never released outside of Japan and is very text-heavy, making Japanese fluency a necessity in order to play it. It was originally released on the NEC PC-9801 and Sharp X68000 home computers and eventually ported to the Super Famicom. [CR]	</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Leading Jockey is a horse racing game for the Super Famicom. It focuses more on the racing aspect than the simulation/management of one's horses and jockeys, unlike ASCII's Derby Stallion or Hect's Thoroughbred Breeder. The player still has a number of options when setting up a race to appeal to enthusiasts of the sport.[CR]The game was followed by a Super Famicom sequel in 1995: Leading Jockey 2.</plot>

			<title_clean>Libble Rabble</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Libble Rabble is a 1983 Namco Arcade game, created by the same Namco developer (Tohru Iwatani) that created Pac-Man and Pole Position. It features the characters of Libble and Rabble as they attempt to harvest Mushlins for dinner.[CR]The gameplay resembles the once-popular board game where players wrap rubber bands around pegs lined up on a board. The player, as the red (Libble) and blue (Rabble) arrows, must maneuver their attaching string around the pegs on the board and touch in order to create a closed loop. Anything within the loop is either collected (Mushlins, and other bonuses) or temporarily thwarted (Hoodlins, other enemies). Once all the Mushlins on the board are collected, the player moves onto the next stage. If nothing is collected inside a loop, it may spawn an additional enemy on the board.[CR]The game was eventually converted to the Sharp X68000, FM Towns and Super Famicom in 1993/94. While keeping most of the basic in-game art of the original Arcade game, it also featured 16-bit cutscenes that described the story.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Miracle Mode[CR]Using controller 1, input this code at the title screen; a fanfare will play after you've entered this code correctly. After pressing Start, the MIRACLE MODE option will appear below SOUND TEST.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Light Fantasy is an RPG with strategy elements developed by A.C.C., a Japanese developer that handled the Nintendo/Super Nintendo ports for the first three games in Falcom's Ys series. Rather than an action RPG in a Ys vein, Light Fantasy's combat consists of random encounters against groups of enemies in grid-based strategic battles in which player characters need to be moved into place before they can attack effectively. These battles occur on the overworld map, rather than a separate battle screen.[CR]The game was followed up with a sequel: Light Fantasy II.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Live a Live is a scenario-based RPG from Squaresoft, similar to their Romancing SaGa series. The player can select between seven scenarios and play through them in any order. Each has a different protagonist and is set in a different time period, but is linked by the same omnipresent evil: an entity known as Odio, which manifests in different forms in each of the scenarios. After all seven are complete, the game moves to the final two chapters.[CR]Live A Live was never released outside of Japan. It remains a Super Famicom exclusive.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Live A Live plays out over several chapters, each with a unique protagonist and subsequent story, and all set during different time periods. For the final chapter, all of the characters from the previous chapters join forces to fight against Odio.Prehistoric Chapter (Contact)[CR]Pogo is the main character during this chapter, and has stats that mostly focus on physical attacks and defense. His best friend, Gori the ape, helps him save the lovely Beru from the dinosaur O-D-O. This chapter is set in a land before language, so the player has to find different ways of communicating with the other NPCs.Bakumatsu Chapter (Secret Orders)[CR]Set in a war-fraught Japan, the main protagonist is the ninja Oboro, a well rounded character in both defense and offense. Along with a veritable carbon copy of himself named Circle, and a fellow prisoner, he fights against a powerful tyrant named Odelou. Oboro can opt to kill every resident of the castle he is sent to, or kill absolutely no-one. Different rewards are given for both.Kung Fu Chapter (Inheritance)[CR]The three main characters; Samo, Lei, and Yun, are all training under the Kung Fu master, Ro. One day, their dojo is attacked by ninjas, which are led by the evil Odiwan Lee. Two of Ro's apprentices are killed, and the remaining character helps Ro kill Odiwan Lee. The apprentice is the character to move onto the finale.Old West Chapter (Wandering)[CR]Sunset, the main protagonist during this chapter, is an outlaw running from a bounty hunter named Maddog. After being jumped by a few members of the local gang called the Crazy Bunch and killing both of them, Sunset and Maddog team up to fight off the inevitable counter attack by the rest of the gang. After a long fight, the leader of the Crazy bunch, O. Dio, attacks them. Sunset and Maddog both defeat O. Dio in the end. The player can make the final battle easier by removing gang members ahead of time by working with the townsfolk to set up traps and ambushes.Present Chapter (The Strongest)[CR]During the present time, the main protagonist, Masaru, enters a tournament in order to learn many different techniques and become the best fighter in the world. After several boss fights, the final fight between Masaru and the mysterious Odie Olbright decides the world's strongest fighter. The player can prolong each battle until they are hit by the opponent's special technique, which they can learn and use in future battles.Near Future Chapter (Flow)[CR]There are three main characters during this time period: Taro, Akira, and Matsu. Akira finds out that the government is trying to summon a god named Odeo by melting everyone on Earth. Akira learns how to control a robot to fight against Odeo. This chapter switches its combat between fighting as Akira on-foot and in the enormous mech Buriki Daioh. Science Fiction Chapter (Mechanical Heart)[CR]The main protagonist is a spherical helper robot named Cube. He investigates the ship after a series of unusual accidents kill the crewmembers one by one. It and the surviving crewmembers discover that the computer's AI entity 0D-10 is the culprit. He is defeated by the main character hacking the video game in the ship's lounge. The weaponless Cube cannot physically attack the behemoth-like creature prowling the spaceship, and must find ways to outwit or evade it to move around.Medieval Chapter (King of Demons)[CR]This chapter is unlocked after the player completes all the other chapters. It focuses on a knight named Oersted, who is tasked with rescuing the princess of the kingdom of Lucretia, who also happens to be his fiancee, from the clutches of the Demon Lord. Joining him include his best friend Straybow, a wizard; Hash, a knight who previously defeated the Demon Lord; and Uranus, a priest. Towards the end of the chapter, things take a turn for the worse, and a string of events causes Oersted to sacrifice his soul to become the next Demon Lord, renaming himself Odio in the process.Final Chapter[CR]This chapter is unlocked after the player completes the Medieval Chapter. There are four ways this chapter plays out, depending on which character the player chooses to be the protagonist and a number of different variables.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Prehistoric Chapter Secrets[CR]Both of these require you to see the scene with Gori and the female monkeys, and getting him back in your party at the Kuu Tribe caves. Both take place in the field where Gori and Pogo were first exiled to before.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Prehistoric Chapter Secrets[CR]Normally you would have to level Masaru to level 16 to get this technique, in the final chapter, but you CAN get it early![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Prehistoric Chapter Secrets[CR]If you collect the MemoryCard item, you don't have to start Captain Square over each time![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Wild West Chapter - True Ending[CR]After defeating O.Dio, you will fight Mad Dog on a 1v1 for the final but easy fight. But this time, you have the option to run and it will do so successfully. Mad Dog will then walk away and you battle him again after the credits, this time sparring his life.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lode Runner Twin: Justy to Liberty no Daibouken ("Justy and Liberty's Big Adventure") is a Lode Runner game for the Super Famicom. As with its predecessors, the goal of the game is to run around a 2D map grabbing items and avoiding enemies. The player can dig holes ahead and behind them (there's a separate button for each) in order to temporarily trap enemies or create shortcuts for themselves.[CR]The game's stand out feature is its two player mode. Justy and Liberty, a brother and sister team of wizards, are tasked by the King to clear a series of mazes under the castle, many of which have unusual themes like toys and candy. Two players can play simultaneously to cooperatively complete the game's levels, or can compete against each other instead in a separate battle mode.[CR]						</plot>

			<title_clean>Lord Monarch</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lord Monarch is an RTS game in which the player assumes one side of a conflict and must overpower the other sides using tactics and diplomacy. The player can establish alliances with other computer sides in order to get an edge, though this alliance dissolves as soon as the player attacks that particular CPU side. The player must conquer the entire map within a strict time limit, often making these temporary alliances a necessity. The player is represented on the map as a special leader character, who acts like leader characters from strategy games like Fire Emblem in that they are generally stronger than most of their regular units, can perform special tasks unique to them and the game will end if they are defeated.[CR]The game is the seventh main entry of the Dragon Slayer franchise. Like Sorcerian before it, the name "Dragon Slayer" is not included in the title.[CR]In the enhanced Super Famicom version, the player can switch the theme from generic medieval fantasy to a whole selection of other settings such as futuristic sci-fi, the Three Kingdoms Era of Ancient China, a fairytale theme and even a setting that re-imagines the game as a territory war between competing fast food chains. This Super Famicom version was one of a handful of games to support the SNES Mouse peripheral. The game was later made accessible through the Satellaview broadcast system, where it is known as BS Lord Monarch.[CR]						</plot>

			<plot>You are a young man who is about to marry his sweetheart Yuka. Everything is prepared for the ceremony, but at the last moment the church is shaken by a mysterious force, and the next thing you know is that your bride has disappeared! Equipped not only with your best weapon and armor, but also with your manly charm, you have to go out to the jungle of modern city, to get Yuka back! I guess it also won't harm if you get acquainted with some pretty ladies on the way, now will it?..[CR]"Love Quest" is a humorous RPG where traditional turn-based, first person perspective combat options are replaced by actions you would normally do to win a girl's attention: you can for example smile, which will cost you MP and inflict big "damage" on the girl, and so on. Your only enemies are girls (including random encounters), and your progress will be determined by your successful fighting. Of course, you also level up, acquire items, better weapons and armor, just like in any "normal" RPG. At certain points girls will also join your party, to heal and to support you.[CR]Despite its "suggestive" themes, the game doesn't feature any explicit sex scenes or nudity.</plot>

			<title_clean>Magic Knight Rayearth</title_clean>
			<plot>This game is based on the anime and manga by manga artist CLAMP.[CR]In the land of Cephiro, the world was kept in peace and harmony by the wishes of Princess Emauraude, the Pillar of Balance. But the evil priest, Lord Zagato, has kidnapped Emauraude, and Cephiro is being invaded by deadly beasts. If this continues, Zagato will gain complete control of Cephiro! The only ones who can stop him are the legendary Magic Knights...[CR]And those Magic Knights are three young girls from Earth. Hikaru Shidou, Umi Ryuuzaki, and Fuu Hououjii have been plucked from modern-day Tokyo and brought to Cephiro by Emauraude, and they're the only ones who can defeat Zagato...as the Magic Knights![CR]This interpretation of the manga story is a traditional Japanese-style RPG. The player controls the three main heroines as a party; each one uses different weapons and learns various skills. Typically for the genre, the party roams the top-down world, visits towns, descends into dungeons, chats with non-playable characters, and fights randomly appearing enemies in turn-based style.</plot>

			<title_clean>Magical Drop</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR]Magical Drop's gameplay is similar to that of other puzzle games. A stack of random colored bubbles descend, the players "clown" can then attempt to arrange in stacks of three, which will cause them to be destroyed. Chains may be formed in typical puzzle game fashion either with a single drop, or by multiple drops in quick succession. The game is always played against either another human player, or a computer controlled player. Chain reactions cause your opponents stack to descend at a faster rate.  In Magical Drop 1, chains are very difficult to perform as the window of time to chain additional drops after you pop a set is very small; this was changed in the minor arcade revision "Magical Drop 1 Plus".  The original Magical Drop was released under the name "Chain Reaction" in the United States, and for whatever reason the drops (based on the 4 suits of tarot, the cups, the coins, the swords, and the wands) were replaced with various candies and snack foods. It has 6 playable characters:   Fool  MagicianHigh Priestess Star Devil Chariot   Mitchell.      World was an unplayable boss at the time. As an additional note, most of the characters were re-designed and re-named for the home releases; as an example, the Chariot has been re-named "Mitchell" and given a "butt-chin" in the playstation version, while devil looks much the same, but has been re-named "Warilin". The game has been re-released, and redone on numerous platforms. The most recent of which being the iPhone.</plot>

Survival: Play as long as you can - an endless flow of balloons appears at a rapidly increasing speed while you move up levels.[CR]2. Puzzle: You have a limited time to clear a fixed set of balloons before time runs out.[CR]3. VS Mode: Fight the CPU or a fellow player in a direct split-screen duel.

			<plot>Magical Taruruuto-kun: Magic Adventure is a Super Mario-style platformer based on the anime and manga of the same name. In the game Taru must cross levels in five worlds to reach and defeat Raivar to save Honmaru's girlfriend Iyona. Taru can attack enemies in a level with his tongue, and he can also eat the many takoyaki scattered throughout the level. Takoyaki can also function as platforms, though, so they shouldn't all be eaten. At the end of a level Taru can use the takoyaki he's eaten to purchase temporary power ups. On the worldmap taru can run into friends and enemies who will challenge Taru to minigames. Win and he gains extra takoyaki and powerups.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Magna Braban: Henreki no Yusha ("Magna Braban: The Wandering Hero") is a fantasy JRPG for the Super Famicom. It was never released outside of Japan but did receive an unofficial fan translation in 2006. The player controls an eager shepherd's son who wishes to become a knight after being saved by a mysterious armored hero one day. He wipes out at his first combat tournament, but befriends a couple of other also-rans in the arena's infirmary. Eventually, he and his friends are thrust into an adventure involving the demon king of the world.[CR]The game uses an innovative combat system in which the player takes on more of a tactical role. The player assigns moves to the characters under their command based on the probability that they will use those moves, and then combat ensues automatically.[CR]							</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mahou Poi Poi Poitto! ("Magic Poi Poi Poitto!") is a puzzle game developed by Metro and published by TAKARA for the Arcade and SNES. It plays similarly to other match-3 games of the era, like Columns, in that the player has to line up three identical pieces horizontally, vertically or diagonally. Pieces fall in square clumps of four, sometimes including cloud pieces which immediately vanish, and very rarely including a sun icon that can remove all the icons of a single type.[CR]The game features a competitive two-player mode and a one-player story mode. In the story mode, the player takes on a series of monsters. The monster intermittently casts spells at the player that randomly transforms blocks into "enemy blocks". By casting magic back at the monster, best done by creating chains and combos, the ground beneath them moves towards the ceiling. Once high enough, the monster is crushed and the player moves onto the next stage.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Puzzle Mode Passwords[CR]Enter any of the following passwords after selecting Continue in Puzzle Mode for Single Player:Legend:R = Red (Fire)B = Blue (Water)Y = Yellow (Air)G = Green (Earth)P = Purple (Aether)W = White (Cloud)E = Grey (Enemy/Evil)O = Orange (Rock)</plot>

In this game, the children must defeat the evil demon Giri to save the world.[CR]Battles are fought in real-time with one player controlling two characters. This amounts to lining up the children in such a way that Nike can swing his sword and hit the enemies while Kukuri shoots her magical balls at them at the same time.</plot>

			<title_clean>Majin Tensei</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Majin Tensei is a Japanese-exclusive Super Famicom turn-based SRPG developed by Atlus and released in 1994. The first of several SRPG games in the Megami Tensei franchise, Majin Tensei tasks the player with fighting an onslaught of demons that suddenly appears in the world and, when possible, negotiating with them so that the demons will join their cause. Although in terms of presentation and gameplay mechanics the game greatly resembles other SRPG series such as Nintendo's Fire Emblem with regards to how battles are conducted and the player roams the map, Majin Tensei still contains a number of a features that are common to Megami Tensei games specifically, including the aforementioned demon recruitment/negotiation, fusion, and lunar cycles that affect demon strength and behavior, among other things.[CR]Majin Tensei would later go on to spawn another Japan-only sequel for the SNES titled Majin Tensei 2: Spiral Nemesis, as well as two spin-offs, Ronde for the Sega Saturn and a cell phone side story that picks up where the first game ends.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]In the late 1990s, the world explodes with ethnic conflicts, resulting in massive death and the closing off of much of the world. Several decades later, in the year 202X, a boy living in area D-03 of Nieder Tokyo suddenly receives a strange demon summoning program on his personal COMP, with demons suddenly appearing in the world immediately afterwards.[CR]							</plot>

			<plot>"Maten Densetsu" is a RPG set in post-apocalyptic Japan, similar in style and in gameplay to  Shin Megami Tensei and other  Megaten games.[CR]You find yourself in the middle of the Tokyo district Akihabara. But is this really Akihabara? The buildings have turned into ruins, and you wander around the deserted streets without any idea of how you could possibly be in such a place. A strange giant head appears in front of you, and defeats you in battle. When you wake up, you find out that Japan is floating in the air, and is attacked by a mysterious force that spawned countless demons who brought destruction to the cities. People are hiding among rubble and in underground passages. Some of them are fighting the demons, joining an organization called Self-Defense Forces. The hero's first objective is to find a way to his home district Shinjuku, where he will obtain more information about the power that threatens Japan, and discover mysterious artifacts from an unknown civilization, called ooparts (out-of-place artifacts).[CR]You can play as either one of the five characters presented to you in the beginning of the game: Rage, Rai, Hokuto, Seigi, and Daigo, each one having his own initial strengths and weaknesses. The entire game plays from first-person perspective. You navigate a cursor over the city map and check out your radar device to find out places of interest. The claustrophobic, extremely complex first-person 3D dungeons have a distinct Shin Megami Tensei flair. The battles are random and turn-based. Your main character doesn't gain levels, but instead accumulates energy points which can be then distributed freely to raise his strength, mental power, defense, etc. Certain characters join your party later in the game, and there are also friendly demons who would join you if you choose a correct way of behavior when you encounter them.</plot>

			<title_clean>Mazinger Z</title_clean>
			<plot>Dr. Hell's robot army has destroyed Tokyo, and now only Kouji Kabuto, and the giant robot Mazinger Z, can stop them from taking over the entire world. Animated cutscenes between levels tell the story of the game.[CR]The Mazinger Z comes with a full armory of anti-robot weaponry, from super-powered karate moves to missiles, Breast Fire, and its signature Rocket Punch. Special moves deplete a regenerating energy meter, while Rocket Punches can be preformed at any time, although Mazinger will be unable to punch until its arms return. Each level contains several varieties of enemies, all of them from the show and unique to each level, that must be defeated to progress. Some enemy robots will fire projectiles from a distance while others will rush in attempt to grapple the Mazinger, and sometimes more than one enemy must be fought at once. Enemies will drop healing items and occasionally an item that upgrades Mazinger's Rocket Punch to the Iron Cutter for a limited time. At the end of each level is a fight with a stronger boss robot with more dangerous attacks.</plot>

			<plot>First you choose one out of four different characters to represent you, Scarlet (red army), Oberon (yellow army), Caesar (green army), or Madcap (blue army). The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any other, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises. [CR]Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles.[CR]Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.[CR]Later on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level up then the at previous level.[CR]If there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.[CR]The main thing as it always is in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your men, making a perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to dominate the world and crush your opponents. [CR]You can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Madcap Level Passwords[CR]Enter the passwords in the password entry screen to go to the desired Epoch and level.  Amount of people available is listed under effect.</plot>

			<plot>This is a sequel to Metal Max. The game is set in a futuristic world. An evil organization known as the Grapplers terrorizes the world, destroying entire cities if they notice a sign of resistance. The elders of Mado City invited four famous monster hunters to defend the city against the Grapplers. One of the hunters, Maria, brought a friend with her - this friend is you, the hero of the game. But even the hunters can't withstand the Grapplers' assault. Their leader, the giant machine-like Ted Broiler, kills Maria. You are left on your own, and you decide to fight the Grapplers and to become a hunter yourself.[CR]The game is a Japanese-style RPG with random encounters and turn-based combat viewed from third-person perspective, like in Final Fantasy games. There are two kinds of combat in the game: standard character-to-character combat, and vehicle battles. vehicles can be purchased, equipped, and modified just like the characters themselves. Various vehicles have different special attacks, and there are plenty of items to collect that will upgrade and repair your vehicles. As a hunter, you can also hunt down various giant monsters that populate the world, and kill them for a reward.</plot>

			<title_clean>Metal Max Returns</title_clean>
			<plot>This is a remake of the game Metal Max, originally for NES. You are a little boy who lives with his father in a town in a futuristic world dominated by machines. Your wish is to become a "hunter" - to kill monsters that roam the world and to receive rewards for that. The storyline and the gameplay basics remained unchanged in this remake. You fight enemies in turn-based combat, and use vehicles, such as your own personal tank Mosquito, to transport yourself through different areas, and to participate in battles. You can also buy equipment and upgrade your vehicles.[CR]The remake features enhanced graphics and sound, background pictures for battles (they were black in the original), slightly different locations (more houses in towns, sometimes different layout of the towns and of the world map), and reduced difficulty level.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Metal Slader Glory: Director's Cut is an enhanced port of an adventure game from 1991 called Metal Slader Glory.

Hal Laboratory developed the Director's Cut for the Super Famicom and Nintendo published the title on November 29, 2000. Metal Slader Glory: Director's Cut holds the honor of being the very last officially released Super Famicom game to come out for the system.</plot>

			<plot>Mickey and Minnie plan to spend a fun-filled day at the circus but to their dismay all the performers have disappeared. Some unknown force has replaced them with crazy characters who are out to make Mickey and Minnie's day an unpleasant one. And on top of that, Donald Duck and Pluto are nowhere to be seen.As Mickey and Minnie search for clue, the trail leads them beyond the circus. Travel along with our hero and heroine as they explore 6 hostile levels like the Haunted House, Frozen Plains and the Jungle. Use special Safari or Western outfits to fend off the enemy and climb through treacherous terrain looking for Donald and Pluto. Hopefully along the way the happenings at the circus will beging to make sense.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hidden 2-Ups[CR]When in Stage One, the Haunted Circus, you will start the game on the fairgrounds. Just ahead is a small pond with an enemy fish swimming in it. At about halfway through the water, there is a wooden support beam in the background. Swim past this and you will receive a 2-Up. [CR]In Stage Two, the Jungle, there is another opportunity for a hidden 2-Up. After beating the halfway boss (the giant turtle), you'll go a couple more screens and come to a section where you'll use the Safari outfit to slide down a number of vines. After reaching the bottom vine, swim in the water beneath, all the way to the left.  The word ''2-Up'' will appear when you have found it.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released on October 22, 1993 exclusively in Japan, Miracle Girls is a side-scrolling action platformer based on the manga of the same name. Miracle Girls was developed by Now Production and published by Takara, and was later unofficially translated into English by RPGONE, a translation group known for projects such as the Dragon Quest series and DoReMi Fantasy.[CR]The game follows twin sisters Tomomi and Mikage as they attempt to rescue their friends from the wizard Majo-Majo, who has trapped them within a mysterious world inhabited by hostile creatures. The game consists of five stages, four of which contain one of the sisters' four friends: Kageura, Daijouji, Noda, or Kurashige.CharactersTomomi (one of two protagonists)Mikage (one of two protagonists)KageuraDaijoujiNodaKurashigeMajo-Majo (the antagonist)[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Attacking an enemy in the game's final level.[CR]Miracle Girls is a fairly traditional side-scrolling platformer. Players control either Mikage or Tomomi, traversing the game's five levels, dodging enemies, pitfalls, traps, and collecting items and power-ups. There is no way to outright kill the game's enemies with a default attack. However, it is possible to stun them with candy, a projectile attack that each of the twins can perform. The only way to kill enemies is through special attack items, labeled with a red "B," which can be picked up and used to kill all onscreen enemies.[CR]There are several other types of power-ups and items in Miracle Girls, including golden hearts that function as the in-game coins (and serve no functional purpose), fruit (which heals the player one heart, with a maximum of five), a 1-Up (granting the player a life), the B-Ball (the aforementioned power-up), a "guide bubble" (the other twin appears and tells the player what to do), and a star that grants temporary invincibility.[CR]One unique aspect of Miracle Girls is the way it handles each level boss, and even the final boss. The first three levels are minigames. Level one's boss is a maze-like water gun fight, where the victor is the one who hits their opponent the most times with the water gun. Level two's boss is a dash to gather the most colored clouds, which fall from the top of the screen. Level three's boss is a Whack-A-Mole-esque game that takes place on top of a cake, where the player has to hit germs as they appear. Level four regurgitates level one's boss, while the final boss consists of each minigame from levels one to three in sequential order.</plot>

			<plot>The hero of the game is Fron, a sixteen-year old boy who lives on the island of Monstania. One day, strolling in the forest, he notices a strange light. The light lead him to a clearing, and then suddenly disappeared. But Fron realized what was the meaning of that light - it was a fairy! Of course, everybody knew that fairies had been long extinct, but Fron never believed in that. All his life he wanted to meet a real fairy, and now, when the opportunity has come, he firmly decides to find her. His girlfriend Tia helps him on the dangerous journey, during which they meet a mysterious little girl named Chitta, and get involved in a grand adventure, that will ultimately lead them to the battle against the dark force that threatens the whole Monstania![CR]"Monstania" has a somewhat unusual gameplay within the frames of console RPGs. You don't explore the world in the game: it is entirely linear and takes you to the next destination by itself (only at a few points you can choose where to go next by selecting an appropriate answer). Once within the location, you cannot leave it until you complete all your objectives there, which then take you to the next location. The objective is usually a large strategic battle. You navigate your party members on the battle field, attack with melee and long-ranged weapons, and use special technique which require action points. Unlike most other turn-based strategy games, an enemy makes a move immediately after you did the same with one of your characters, without waiting for the "enemy turn". The RPG element is not very significant: your characters level up automatically after each battle. There are also some puzzles to solve in certain locations.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]At the title screen.</plot>

The takes a party of super-deformed heroes through a board, rolling dice and fighting monsters. The player is given a goal when they begin and must make their way towards completing it. There is often another party of adventurers working against the player to complete the same goal.[CR]The game also includes a card-based interface for the combat.

The earth now faces imminent destruction by the universal evil threat known as Giygas!Armed with a cracked baseball bat, a cookie and an ATM card, a courageous boy named Ness vows to save the planet from hideous destruction.

The ultimate test lies in the impending encounter with the all powerful Giygas![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Exit Mouse in the Cave of the Past[CR]Note: This only works in the Super Famicom version of Earthbound(Mother 2).[CR]In Mother 2, you could use the Exit Mouse in the Cave of the Past, which was never intended obviously, since the feature is missing in Earthbound.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Exit Mouse in the Cave of the Past[CR]You can use the Rock Candy in battles an unlimited amount of times to increase your stats. You have to have it in one of the two very bottom spaces of one of your characters' inventories, and you have to use it with any condiment (preferably something like Sugar Packets or Jars of Delisauce, because they will increase one of your stats by 2 instead of one). This will allow you to get greater boosts in stats when you level up.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] $50 Easy in Twoson[CR]Outside of the hotel room in Twoson, there will be a man sitting at a table. Constantly speak to him (his response will change each time) until he decides to hand you $50 so you can leave him alone. It takes about 20 sessions of talking for him to fork it over, but it's well worth it, plus it'll make up for the night you spent at the hotel.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] $50 Easy in Twoson[CR]If you go into a room with a large amount or any amount of enemies in it, you can exit the room and re-enter it and the amount of enemies changes sometimes even taking them all out of that room.

			<title_clean>Mystery Circle</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mystery Circle is a Japan-exclusive puzzle game developed by Wave and published by K. Amusement Leasing Co. for the SNES platform. It plays like a combination of Tetris and Qix, with the player attempting to trace the outline of falling shapes before the screen fills up with them and causes the game to end. If every side of an object has a red outline, left by travelling around its circumference, the object vanishes and adds to the player's score, as well as dropping any objects sitting on top of it. The player has access to a single-use emergency satellite, which instantly eliminates everything within one third of the screen.[CR]The game has a sci-fi theme, with a brief intro animation of the player's starship warping into a star system to begin the stage. The game was never released outside of Japan.</plot>

			<title_clean>Mystic Ark</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR]Mystic Ark is the third game made by Enix and Produce, after Elnard (The 7th Saga) and Brain Lord. It mutated the turn-based combat system and the party system from Elnard, while it inherited the emphasis on puzzles from Brain Lord.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR][B]Heroes:[/B][CR]The main characters of the game, they are the only characters able to navigate the Shrine and the only characters able to turn monsters into figurines.They wear heavy armor and are proficient in the use of swords.[CR]You can choose the gender of the hero, which affects his/her abilities, status, and default name. They most likely came from the Green World.1) Lemele/Remeer the Hero[CR]The male protagonist is more oriented towards physical attributes. The attack spells he can learn are fire-elemental. (He is similar to Olvan the Dwarf from the 7th Saga.)2) Ferris/Fellis the Heroine[CR]The female protagonist is more oriented towards magical attributes. The attack spells she can learn are ice-elemental. She can learn more magic than Lemele/Remeer, especially healing and support spells. (She is similar to Kamil the Human warrior from the 7th Saga.)Spellcasting character classes3) Meisia the Priestess[CR]A priestess (or White Mage), she is the main healer of the game. She can wear the same light armor as Miriene, the witch. The weapons she can use best are staves, but she should rather focus on magic. (She is similar to Valsu the Human healer from the 7th Saga.)4) Miriene the Witch[CR]She is a fairly balanced spellcaster, not specializing in anything in particular. She learns a wide array of spells with different effects, and she's especially useful with her support and debuff skills. She can wear the same light armor as Meisia, the priestess. The weapons she can use best are knives, but she should rather focus on magic. (She is similar to Esuna the Elf girl from the 7th Saga.)5) Kamiwoo the Ogre[CR]This character (a Black Mage) is best used for his offensive spells. His choice of armor is limited. The weapons he can use best are axes. (He is similar to Lejes the Demon from the 7th Saga.)Physical character classes6) Reeshine the Grappler[CR]She specializes in strong melee attacks. The weapons she can use best are nunchuks and boomerangs. She can wear her own martial arts suits for protection. (She is similar to Wilme the Alien from the 7th Saga.)7) Lux the Tetsujin[CR]"Tetsu-jin" is Japanese for "man of iron". A mysterious robot, Lux specializes in heavy attacks. While he shares many of his characteristics with Lux from The 7th Saga, there is no known relationship between the two. He can equip iron fists and iron armor exclusive to him.8) Tokio the Ninja[CR]A speedy ninja, he gains several useful abilities, like a double hit and a power-boosting yell. He can equip the same heavy armor as the Heroes and he is proficient in the use of most weapons; in particular, he's the only character proficient in the use of sabers and bows. (He is different from any of the seven characters in the 7th Saga.)[CR]Arks[CR]Throughout the game, the player acquires magical objects called Arks. The Arks are like fairies, able to impart their powers onto objects, something the player must do to solve various puzzles in the game. They also represent the scattered power of the Goddess The Arks are:Ark of Power[CR]This Ark is found in the Sand World, in a shrine that can only be reached after the world is flooded. Along with the Ark of Wisdom, the Ark of Power is the only one capable of summoning allies for combat. It can power things that humans cannot, like rusty switches or electrical devicesArk of Light[CR]A group of beetles in the Fruit World have this Ark, and the only way to get it is to beat them. In battle, it imparts lightning properties to whatever it is attached to.Ark of Wisdom[CR]After defeating the Chimera that is terrorizing the Child World, Celia gives this to your party. She uses it to give herself powers far beyond her own abilities. Along with the Ark of Power, the Ark of Wisdom is the only one capable of summon allies for combat. Its wisdom allows unreadable texts to become readable.Ark of Fire[CR]This Ark is found in the Green World, hidden within the underground factory's Hydro Cell. This Ark lights things on fire, obviously. It also gives weapons fiery property.Ark of Water[CR]This Ark is found in the Dark World. It simply fills objects with water.Ark of Wood[CR]This Ark is found in the Wind World, given to the heroes after they destroyed the Ancients.Ark of Darkness[CR]The Darkness gives this to the protagonists after its defeat in the Fairytale World. With it (and the other Arks), they are able to face Black Heart. [CR]Worlds/Story[CR]Shrine[CR]A secluded island containing all other worlds, and where the hero's journey begins. Also within this world are figurines of several characters who must be restored to their proper form in their own world. In the back of this shrine is a passage leading to Black Heart, only accessible using the Ark of Darkness. Sand World[CR]You enter this world through a model ship. Although barren and dry upon entering, by the time you leave, it is flooded with water. Two groups of cat pirates, the Bloodhooks and the Gumbos, are waging war, and it is your duty to resolve this conflict. This requires working for both factions, taming a large mole monster, and enlisting the help of a cat witch to settle the conflict once and for all. Fruit World[CR]This world is found within a green pumpkin in the Shrine's kitchen, and all the towns in this world are in fruits themselves. The player must rescue the citizens of the Gourd Bridge from mimicking foxes and restore various towns by planting their seeds near a river and watering them. This world's Ark is in the hands of a group of beetles who torment the citizens of Fruit World. However, after being beaten the first time, a crow steals it from a beetle holding the Ark and retreats to a forest in the north. The player gains the Ark of Light after beating a fox who was masquerading as a beetle to gain the Ark for himself. Child World[CR]Entering this world requires using the Ark of Light on a music box in the Shrine's windmill. For a significant amount of time, the player is stuck in a small town called Blind Alley; it is only after they have played with the children that they are able to leave this town. Until the player visits Candy Mountain, there are no monsters to be found, and the entire world is populated almost entirely by children. In fact, the only adult not in the player's party is Celia, a woman who takes care of all the children in a mansion southwest of Blind Alley.[CR]However, after the player restores the mansion's plaza, Celia starts behaving weirdly; she won't let any of the children play outside or speak with any of the heroes. It is up to them to find out what is causing her to act this way. After exploring her secret lab underneath the mansion, the protagonists find out that Celia is actually a witch and that she is the reason why monsters infest the World. She was working with the Chimera, and in exchange for a perfect body, the Chimera's master would rid their world of monsters. Coincidentally, the Chimera reveals that its master is the one able to turn people and objects into figurines. Green World[CR]Found within a clock on the Shrine's second floor, everything in this world is, at first, completely colorless. Thomas Edison lives in a nearby town, but his only his heart remains. The player must bring it back to the shrine, infuse it into Edison's figurine, and bring it back to town. Soon after, the player must acquire gold wine to give to Capone so they can pass through his checkpoint. However, he traps them in a cave because he thinks the wine is fake. After escaping the cave, Capone, confident in the party's abilities, asks them a favor: find his missing daughter. After doing so, he rewards them with gold, alcohol, and permission to pass through the checkpoint.[CR]Upon reaching the top of the mountain Capone was guarding, they discover that the other half of the world has color, but no sound. In nearby Duplo Town, the protagonist finds out that the people all speak sign language, and one of them teaches it to the player so they can speak with everybody in town. Soon, the party finds themselves aiding an artist named Pablo with his work. While helping him, they discover a secret passage that leads to a remote town with both color and sound. Einstein is living here, and he has been working on a machine. Although the precise purpose isn't known, it is know that the machine is broken, and can only be repaired with a certain tree sap. Much to Einstein's chagrin, Edison has put himself in charge of the repairs.[CR]Eventually, Einstein gathers the strength to challenge Edison's role, somehow leading to the repair of the machine. Finally, it is revealed that the machine is an elevator to an underground society/factory. Many of the people in the town are sick because they all work in the nearby factory. While exploring the factory, it is revealed that the factory is responsible for the lack of color and sound in certain parts of the world. Later, the party finds the Chimera, who then unleashes three knights against them. The heroes are victorious, and upon winning the battle, are rewarded with an upgraded key card. This allows them access to the Hydro Cell area of the factory, which holds the Ark of Fire. When they take it out of its chest, color and sound return to the areas of Green World from which they were absent. Wind World[CR]Upon touching a sand-filled flask in a nearby cave, the hero is warped to an altar in this world. People praying by the altar at the time of their arrival believe him to be their savior, sent to repair their winds. Of course, they'll receive the Ark of Wood upon completion of this task. The task: rescue somebody from a cave. They do so, but upon further exploration of the cave, the group discovers a stone with a message in another language (that they can read with the power of the Ark of Wisdom). It reveals that the wind is generated by a sleeping giant, something the townspeople take hard. The night after this discovery, the giant wakes up, going on rampage and stopping the flow of the wind. On their journey to find the giant, the party travels to the top of a mountain, only to arrive at a nearby town mysteriously. All they know is that a man named Curtis is missing.[CR]However, they find/rescue him in a nearby tower. He was studying the artifacts in the tower when a monster attacked him. When the party finds two books at the bottom of the tower, they bring them back to Curtis for him to translate. One of the books mentions a mirror that seals away magic hidden somewhere in the sands of the world. The group finds it in a nearby cave and, upon retrieving it, show it to Curtis. He speaks of its uses, and the party then travels to a nearby factory. Inside is a clone, who they are able to beat with the help of the mirror. However, after the battle, the mirror breaks. Upon further exploration of the factory, they find the switch that shuts down all the machinery. After turning the machines off, Curtis relays to them the message of the Black Book: that there is a race of Ancients still living, and that the Giant is actually one of their creations.[CR]The book also allows them entrance to a nearby tower which helps them stop the Ancients from polluting the world. At the top of the tower is a device which seems to control the Giant. When activated, the Giant knocks down the tower, turning it into a bridge to a nearby island. On the island is an underground cloning facility full of Ancients. After fighting through the relatively few awake Ancients, the group meets Kuga, leader of the Ancients. He not only plans to pollute the skies, but to eliminate light from the world. After his defeat, the Ancients are no more, the Giant sinks into the ocean, and wind returns to the world. As thanks, the people give him the Ark of Wood. Dark World[CR]Only the hero is allowed to enter this world (through a painting in the Shrine), and once they enter, they cannot leave until they complete the world. Through diaries scattered throughout the world, the hero learns that others have entered this world, but were driven to madness by being trapped in it. Since the Hero is the only (visible) character in this world, there is little story to it; the Dark World is a confusing mess of puzzles and brain-teasers. The Ark of Water is found here. However, after finding it, the Darkness escapes from the world with the hero and reveals that it grew up there, writing the entries in the diaries and slowly becoming insane. Fairytale World[CR]This world is populated by many famous characters from fairy tales, including Hansel &amp; Gretel, Cinderella, and the Big Bad Wolf. In fact, the King is looking for people to hunt down the Big Bad Wolf. But while hiring the protagonists to do just that, a woman interrupts the King to inform him that Little Red Riding Hood and her grandma have been captured by the wolf. With the help of Geppetto, the group reaches the Big Bad Wolf, defeats him, and rescues the girls. Oddly enough, Little Red Riding Hood reveals that the Big Bad Wolf inadvertently saved her from the Darkness.[CR]When they return to tell the King of their exploits, a little girl interrupts the King (again) and tells him that the Goblin of Kuru Forest has been terrorizing Tinkle Town again. Again, the King asks the hero to take care of the problem. In the Kuru Forest, they discover that the Goblin was actually a cowardly lion lion. He is searching for a tower in the forest because he heard a wizard in the tower will grant him courage, but finds out that he's in the wrong forest. When the heroes tell this to the King, he allows them audience with the wizard, a recluse who can grant them any wish they desire. However, the wizard reveals that the Darkness stole his powers, and that it is a threat the King should not take lightly. In addition, he reveals that Gretel knows where the Darkness is.[CR]She reveals that it is in the waterfall to the south of Tinkle Town, and that they need an invisibility cloak to reach it. However, the only tailor capable of making such a cloak is nowhere to be found, mainly because he sends the group on a pointless fetch quest without them knowing it. Once they reveal that the King sent them, he's happy to oblige, under one condition: that the heroes give Cinderella a dress for the upcoming ball. They also give her glass slippers they received from a shoe-bearing tree. Everything occurs according to the original story until the Darkness turns several people into figurines, and captures the rest, taking them to the aforementioned waterfall.[CR]On their way to rescue the people of Tinkle Town, a Keaton Fox appears and challenges them to a fight. After beating him, they must face a Water Dragon, and then, finally, the Darkness. After its defeat, the Darkness reveals that those who faced it in the past became its slaves. Being the only people to have beaten it, the Darkness gives them the Ark of Darkness. Mini Game World[CR]A secret world only accessible through a tree behind the Shrine, the only things here are two card-flipping mini games; one of them involves flipping cards until you hit the demon card, another is a simple card matching game. Both of these games garner prizes depending on how well you did.Arena[CR]This world is contained within an immovable sword on the beach behind the Shrine. Here, you can trade in monsters for special items, bet on monsters in fights (much like Dragon Quest III), or pit your own monsters in combat.[CR]Fan Translation[CR]Since this game was never released outside of Japan, there has never been an official translation or localization. Due to the complexity of rewriting this game's script and hacking it back in, the fan translation took 10 years to complete, making this one of the last SNES-era RPG's to receive a translation. It was finally released in 2010; oddly enough, a second  - completely different translation from a different group was released mere weeks later.[CR]		</plot>

The player character is Shintaro, a member of the Genma army, as he runs across the island to find out where a bunch of invading monsters came from.[CR]The game is a mix of brawling and platforming. Shintaro has a quick punch move and a charged-up beam attack, and fights various sub-bosses as he makes his way through levels. He'll occasionally meet characters from the manga as well, including Tanno and Itou, who are a transvestite fish and an effeminate pink snail respectively.[CR]Both the Game Boy and Super Famicom versions were released on the same day by Enix Corporation, which also published the manga.[CR]	</plot>

			<plot>The young fighter Ryu was thrown out of his father's home, and this childhood trauma has been dominating his life ever since. His only wish is to surpass his father and to show him he has become a better fighter than him. Laila is a cheerful treasure hunter. She dreams only of valuable things, adventure, travels, and life in the capital city.  Gaou is experiencing a personal tragedy: he wants to discover the mystery of the disappearance of a woman he loved, Asuka, aided by his best friend Froz. Naaga is a girl who wears a heavy armor, which - as she thinks - will prevent her from losing any battle. At present, she has problems since she owes a million gold pieces to her guild. What do those heroes have in common? As their ways cross, they will find out they are in fact pursuing one and the same goal...[CR]"Burning Heroes" lets you start as either one of the four characters. Each one starts in a different place and is seemingly absorbed in his/her personal quest, but as the game progresses, the four heroes meet each other. You should also find and "unlock"  four other playable characters as you advance in the game. The gameplay system of "Burning Heroes" is similar to other console-style RPGs: you fight random enemies and bosses in turn-based combat, viewed from third-person perspective, like in  Final Fantasy games. As you get hit in a battle, your "passion" (literally "hot blood", nekketsu in Japanese) level rises, and the more damage you take, the quicker you reach 100%. Once the passion bar is full, you can summon a powerful monster and to unleash a devastating attack on the entire enemy party.</plot>

The game was originally due for a US release with the title The Journey Home: Quest for the Throne, but production was canceled close to completion.[CR]The player assumes the role of Duke, a young swordsman, and is able to push objects, jump and slash enemies in the vicinity, and many sequences require some degree of platforming. [CR]Developers Wolf Team would eventually go on to create another action RPG of some notability, Tales of Phantasia.[CR]		</plot>

			<plot>Players take on the challenge of one of the most beautiful and notorious golf courses in the world: Pebble Beach. These eighteen-holes demand accuracy, finesse, and even at times brute strength. The famous beach-side course is littered with sand-bunkers as well as sweeping fairways and cliff-side greens. [CR]Game play takes a classic approach - players control a selected golfer from a third-person perspective. Swing-control is displayed as a power and accuracy meter with which players must start and stop accordingly. Again, the classic-style putting system, complete with a topographic grid, lets the player know of the slope and elevation of the three-dimensional putting surface.[CR]As there are no other courses to play, this game is a tribute and testament to the challenging course-design of Pebble Beach Golf Links.</plot>

			<title_clean>NHL Pro Hockey '94</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]NHL 94 is a vertically oriented ice hockey simulation based on the game engine behind NHLPA 93. NHL 94 makes playable all NHL teams (active at the end of the 1993 season), complete with robust (though incomplete) player rosters, in addition to the East and West conference All-Star teams. Various players attributes (e.g. speed, aggression, shot) are ranked based on a 100 point system and affect the way players perform in the game.[CR]New Features Introduced[CR]These features were added from EA Sports previous game NHLPA 93:Goalie ControlShootout GamePenalty ShotsBench and Board Checks3 or 4 Player Compatible with Adapter (5 players on SNES)1992-93 Player Ratings &amp; RostersVariable Player Ratings when on Hot/Cold StreaksSave Player Records for each playerSave User Standings and RecordsOne-times and Special Moves by Selected PlayersNew Player StatsFlip PassesReverse-Angle ReplayClear the zone while killing penaltiesAutomatic Line Changes (can manually change lines at play stoppage)Tougher Computer DefenseTougher GoaliesComputer Shooting Scoring MovesPlayer and Team CardsPlayer Profiles with 144 Player PicturesLogan Organ Music matches Home ArenaTeam logos at center iceNew crowd animationsNo fighting or bloodPeriod StatsMore kinds of game statsTwo expansion teams (Anaheim and Florida)[CR]Innovation[CR]NHL 94 has been lauded as one of the best sports games ever made. It improved on the innovative NHLPA 93 engine, adding smoother sprite animation and a host of new gameplay mechanics. Perhaps the most important of the newly introduced gameplay features was the ability to perform a one-timer. (For non-initiated, a one-timer is when you pass the puck to a player and the intended recipient shoots the puck immediately, without pause.) The one-timer proved to be one of the most accessible scoring options in the game. Scoring was also made easier by the inclusion of a more robust deke mechanic with NHL 94 (at least in the SNES version of the game). In addition, gamers were also able to save their user records.[CR]NHL 94 also evolved from its predecessor by reducing the frequency of slap-shot goals scored through the goalie&#8217;s five-hole and stopping the ability to run into the goalie and have the puck your player was carrying drift into the net. Perhaps the most conspicuous feature included in NHLPA 93 and omitted from NHL 94 was the ability to fight your opponents. Fighting returned with NHL 95.[CR][B]Game Modes:[/B][CR]Regular SeasonPlayoffsBest of Seven PlayoffsShootoutExhibition[CR]NHL Teams &amp; Rankings[CR]The following is a chart of the 26 NHL teams featured in NHL 94 and their rankings, strengths and weakness. These stats appear in the manual and the Team Selection screen.

The main menu looks rather different from one version to the next, the SNES version adopting a much more basic design. There are also slight graphical differences during gameplay. Possibly the most significant difference is that the SNES version will not track players' statistics from one game to the next (for example, to see which player on your team is leading in goals scored during playoff mode).[CR]Ron Barr's Quotes[CR]Welcome to a sold out {insert arena], home of the [insert home team]Hi I'm Ron Barr for EA Sports... and in goal tonight [goalie name] for [team] and [goalie name] for [opposing team]For [team name], [player name] is on a hot streak, but [player name] is on a cold streak.The [arena] crowd record is [number] db.Hit the Start button to begin, Use the A and C to cycle through menus.Lately [team name] has been playing well ...

However do to copyright, lacked the official NHL rosters of the time. There was also a European version of the game released as NHL Hockey 91.[CR]Cover Athletes[CR]Tomas Sandstrom of the Los Angeles Kings shooting against Andy Moog of the Boston Bruins.[CR]Cheats for Sega Genesis Release[CR]30 Second Periods: Hold A C when you turn on your Sega Genesis and do so until you get to the Edit Lines Screen, you should see a :30 time on your periods.Instant Healing: If a player gets injured, pause the game and then take a time out.

Ed Semrad wrote, "... a must for any sports fan. EA is getting closer to making the ultimate hockey game". Mike Weigand wrote, "...Loads of new features have been added to NHL '94. Now there are four players with 2-on-2, or any combination you may like. Other new features include real players' stats from the previous season, including faces and streaks. They also have the new logos and each team's rink music.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Nice de Shot is a golf game from Magical Company, released on the Super Famicom in 1994. The game supports up to two players who compete on eighteen different courses. A single-player option, in which the player goes through each course sequentially, is also available. Each course takes place in a different part of the world, and tends to include unusual features like ice, stalagmites and other unlikely obstacles.[CR]The game uses a rudimentary polygonal landscape to convey the lay of the land to the player, though this increases the loading time in many parts of the game as the topography has to be loaded in every time it shifts, either after a shot or while adjusting the camera to aim the ball a different direction.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hidden Character[CR]At the character select screen, move the cursor to 'Seibetsu' and press  the buttons in order[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hidden Character[CR]To get to 'seibetsu' start a game, choose the first option on Data Load screen (ie do not load), choose either of the next options, choose number of players, on the next screen, push up twice and the cursor will be pointed at 'seibetsu'.

Or, go for one-on-one pointers from Mansell and have the track all to yourself while you practice the moves of a master. Then, check in for the big one.

			<plot>Newman Haas Indy Car is, as the name shows, a racing game endorsed by the CART racing team of the same name and their top driver at the time, Englishman Nigel Mansell. [CR]The player has the option to drive a single race (where the option to practice is hidden) or go for the crown against 12 other drivers in 15 tracks (with some variety, not only ovals) across North America, with the season opener in Queensland, Australia. It is possible play solo, with a friend in split screen or with split screen against the computer, and if music or engine sounds are played in the race.[CR]A key choice in the game is selecting between Arcade and Simulation mode - in the later, the car can take a lot less damage before giving up, fine-tuning must be done by the driver and rules are enforced, under the risk of a disqualification.[CR]Graphically, the game is less sterile than most driving games of the platform (and in 16-bit consoles, generally), thanks to the inclusion of several polygonal buildings scattered around the circuits.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ninja Warriors is an enhanced remake of the 1987 Taito Arcade brawler The Ninja Warriors, and should not be confused with the original game. In Japan it is known as The Ninja Warriors Again, and as Ninja Warriors: The New Generation in Europe.[CR]The blue ninja and red kunoichi characters are joined by Kamaitachi (named for the "sickle weasel" of Japanese folklore; a youkai with bladed arms). In addition, the game has a significant graphical update, all new stage layouts and a new "Blaster" power-up system.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Ninja Warriors takes place in a dystopian future where Banglar, the President of the United States, issues martial law on the nation. A small band of scientists decide to rebel against the new military government with the creation of android robots codenamed Ninja, Kunoichi and Kamaitachi who are sent to strike back against the government.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Like Rush'n Attack, gameplay is restricted to a single, side-scrolling 2D plane. Players move can move left and right as well as attacking, jumping, blocking and using a special attack or smart bomb styled attack on enemies. Special attacks and smart bombs require a 'Blaster' meter to be built up fully. The Blaster meter charges over time and is lost when the player is knocked to the floor or the smart bomb is fired, killing all enemies on screen. While the Blaster meter is fully charged players have access to modified, more powerful versions of their standard moves which kill enemies faster, however using these moves does not deplete meter. Objects and enemies within the level can be picked up and thrown as weapons against enemies also.[CR]Levels, generally, scroll from left to right and have a boss encounter which, when defeated, ends the level.[CR]Ninja Warriors consists of 8 levels.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]British magazine Super Play gave this Super Nintendo Entertainment System remake of The Ninja Warriors a score of 84% upon its release for the SNES in 1994.[CR]		</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rocky Rodent, released in Japan as Nitro Punks: Might Heads, is a mascot platformer from Irem for the SNES. It is somewhat inspired by the success of Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog, and features a rodent protagonist who is able to sprint at great speeds during certain sections of the game. However, most of the game's level design is engineered around Rocky's constantly changing hairstyle - each style has a different attack or ability associated with it, and these abilities are usually required to progress further through the game.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Rocky's on the run once again for stealing food when he bumps in to the owner of the restaurant from which he just skipped out on. The owner beseeches Rocky: the mob has kidnapped his daughter and is holding her for ransom. If Rocky can save her and thrash the mafia goons that are tightening their grip on the city, Rocky will be able to eat all he wants at his restaurant for life. Not one to pass up a meal ticket, Rocky agrees and sets off on his quest across the vast metropolis to retrieve the restaurant owner's daughter.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Things get hairy! [CR]Rocky Rodent is a standard mascot platformer. By holding down the run button, Rocky picks up a considerable amount of speed - something that comes in handy in later "chase" stages. But what primarily sets Rocky Rodent apart from the pack are his power-ups - there's no Mushrooms,  Tiki Masks or  breakable TVs to be found in the world of Rocky Rodent. Rocky's power-ups come out of trashcans, and in the form of special hair styles. There are several hair styles in the game, each with their own unique functions:Hairspray: Styles Rocky's hair in to a giant pink spike, which can be used like a rhino horn to skewer enemies and break cracked ceiling blocks. By jumping in to certain ceiling types, Rocky can stick in to the ceiling and use it to flip around to the floor above.Electric Shaver: Gives Rocky a literal "buzz cut" - an axe-like mohawk that can be thrown and returns like a boomerang. Can be used to cut things. Rocky can embed it into walls and jump off them as well.Flower Pot: This gives Rocky a braided ponytail that allows him to latch onto and swing across any hooks in the level.Bird's Nest: This unkempt haircut includes a flashing egg, which will eventually hatch if Rocky manages to avoid taking damage. Once hatched, a helpful companion named Pecky will chase after and defeat regular enemies. Pecky will not chase after or damage bosses, however.Salon Dryer: A large machine that changes Rocky's hair into a coiled spring. By bouncing on his head with this hairstyle, Rocky's vertical leap is greatly enhanced.[CR]In addition to being stylish, Rocky's hairdos also protect him from one additional hit of damage. If Rocky takes damage without a hair style, he will die.[CR]					</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Nobunaga no Yabou: Haouden ("Nobunaga's Ambition: Tale of the Conquerer") is a strategy-sim from Koei and the fifth in their flagship Nobunaga's Ambition series of Sengoku-era feudal sims. Once again, the player assumes one of a number of daimyos, including Oda Nobunaga himself, and tries to take over the rest of Japan. It was originally released in 1992 for the PC-9801 home computer and ported to various other computers and consoles of the period.[CR]Among the tweaks to the gameplay was the addition of castles, which are now the locations that players must conquer in order to take over new territory. Haouden was also the first game in the series to be given an expansion pack, though this pack would not be available to all versions of the game.[CR]The game was the first flagship Nobunaga's Ambition game to never receive a US localization. It sits between the fourth game, Nobunaga's Ambition: Lord of Darkness (Nobunaga no Yabou: Bushou Fuuunroku) from 1990, and the sixth game, Nobunaga no Yabou: Tenshouki from 1994.[CR]		</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Nontan to Isshi: KuruKuru Puzzle ("Nontan and Friends: Round-and-Round Puzzle") is a puzzle game for the Super Famicom and Game Boy. It was released exclusively in Japan and is based on the Nontan books for younger children that follows the eponymous mischievous kitten and his animal friends on their adventures. The game is a twist on the standard block-stacking puzzle game.[CR]Nontan to Isshi: KuruKuru Puzzle is one of the few games that Game Freak worked on before they created their breakout hit Pok&#233;mon. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The goal of Nontan to Isshi: KuruKuru Puzzle is to stack blocks so that two matching icons are connected to one another adjacently and vanish. The player cannot rotate the two-piece blocks that fall from the top: instead, they flip the blocks around to reveal two different blocks on the opposite side. Most of the flipped blocks are linked to their originals: a fish becomes a fish skeleton, an apple becomes an apple half, etc. Sometimes they're rare bee or character face blocks instead: both are rare and are therefore difficult to clear once one appears, but two face blocks will eliminate an entire row when connected and are thus worth the hassle.[CR]The game has an endless single-player mode that only ends once the blocks reach the top of the screen. There is also a two-player mode.</plot>

			<plot>Marooned on a tropical island far from home, Lester faces it all with the courage of a small frightened rodent. Our unlikely hero has as much trouble walking as he does facing treacherous obstacles. It's the ultimate 'geek to greatness' adventures as you guide Lester through his rite of passage. Help him face the terrors of the beach, the haunting chills of the underworld and the dreaded pirates of the south seas. Do all of this and Lester just might make it home, maybe even a little cooler than when he started. There's just one catch though, Lester can be slithly opinionated when it comes to his safety.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Osu!! Karate Bu ("Go! Karate Club") is a fighter game based on the Osu!! Karate Bu serialized manga by Koji Takahashi. The story mode (and intro) features Takagi Yoshiyuki, the leader of the gang-like Kangokou High School Karate Club which goes around fighting karate clubs from other schools as well as various ruffians and criminal elements around Osaka. The story mode has Takagi fight through several of these challengers as they attempt to take his title of "Soul of Osaka", which gives him sovereignty over the other gangs in Osaka.[CR]The game is a standard martial arts one-on-one fighter in most respects, though features a few uncommon aspects. The first of which is that the player's health bar does not replenish after each round, and the fight continues as each bar is depleted. The second is that the player can recover from losing all their health if they have enough on their power (or qi) gauge. The game counts to three, like in professional wrestling, and the player has the chance to recover a small amount of health in exchange for their power.[CR]It is the only game based on this particular manga and was never released outside of Japan.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Othello World is an Othello/Reversi board game simulation from Dice Creative and Tsukuda Original. The single-player has a fairytale literature theme to it as characters as diverse as Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat and The White Rabbit, as well as traditional characters like Little Red Riding Hood and the seven Dwarves, challenge the player to Othello duels before they are allowed to proceed onwards.[CR]Othello World was eventually followed by a PS1 sequel: Othello World II: Yume to Michi e no Chousen.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]As is traditional in Othello, the goal is to sandwich the opponent's pieces between two pieces of the player's own color. Doing so flips all of the opponent's tiles between the two, awarding them to the player. It's generally imperative to reach the boundary of the board, and especially the corners, as pieces placed there are in more defensible positions.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Otogirisou (the Japanese name for the St. John's wort herb) is a "sound novel", the first of its kind, from Chunsoft. The player is taken through a multiple-choice story with static images and text that is backed with sound effects and music, hence the term "sound novel". Though Chunsoft originated the term, several other visual novel developers would borrow the format for their own games.[CR]The story of Otogirisou concerns a young man, Kohei, and his girlfriend, Nami, who find themselves stranded after their car crashes and decide to take shelter in an empty western-style mansion nearby. The game is horror-themed and features supernatural elements.[CR]It was eventually followed by a sequel of sorts in Kamaitachi no Yoru. Otogirisou would eventually be rereleased on the Playstation and the Wii's Virtual Console. [CR]A film adaptation was released in 2001, and can be found in the West under its literal translation, "St. John's Wort".</plot>

			<plot>Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic is a digital conversion, with anime mascots, of the classic Japanese newspaper puzzle nonograms. A nonogram is a puzzle on a square or rectangular grid the object of which is to reveal a hidden picture. Along each row and column there is a number or series of numbers which indicate how many squares will be colored in that row or grid. Example; "5 9 4" would mean there would be sets of five, nine, and four colored squares in the grid, in that order, with at least one blank in between. [CR]Ou-chan no Oekaki Logic adds a story mode where Ou-Chan, representing the player, competes with other blobby anime characters in finding hidden images in the nonogram grids.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pachi-Slot Love Story is the first of numerous pachi-slot simulation games from Coconuts Japan for the Super Famicom. Pachi-slot is a portmanteau of pachinko and slots, though for all intents and purposes the game is simply just slots/fruit machines. The player must match up icons to complete a row of three for a payout dependent on the icons being matched, with three "7"s generating the largest payout.[CR]Coconuts Japan published the game in late 1993. It falls between the second and third game in their Pachi-Slot Adventure series for the Famicom/NES. It was followed by Ganso Pachi-Slot Nippon Ichi.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pachiokun Special is the first Super Famicom entry into Coconuts Japan's Pachiokun franchise, starring the eponymous sentient pachinko ball. As with earlier games in the series, there is a single-player adventure mode that acts as a framing device for the game's many pachinko tables. Each pachinko table has its own "personality" regarding the preferable amount of power when firing the pachinko balls and the likely payouts.[CR]There would eventually be two more Pachiokun Special games: Pachiokun Special 2 and Pachiokun Special 3. "Special" simply signifies that these are the Super Famicom entries in the series.</plot>

			<plot>Peace in the world of Popples is being threatened by the devil king Thanatos, who has cast a spell over the world. Lip, the Fairy of Flowers, escaped the grasp of this spell, and must free her friends, the other fairies, and defeat the evil king to restore peace to the land.[CR]Panel de Pon is a fact-paced action puzzler that belies its cute exterior with extremely fast-paced matches. A stack of blocks continually rises from the bottom of the screen, and the player controls a cursor which can swap any two blocks horizontally. Make a row or column of three or more and they'll clear, potentially creating combos from new blocks falling to take their place. Combos will send large garbage blocks to your opponent, which must be eliminated by clearing a piece that is touching it, turning it into normal blocks.[CR]The game offers a story mode against the computer, as well as a 2-player versus mode, an endless mode, a timed mode where a certain number of blocks must be cleared, and a puzzle mode where a set arrangement of blocks must be cleared in a specific number of moves. A reworked version of the game, which changes all the characters to ones from Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island, was released internationally as Tetris Attack.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 1-P vs. Mode Passwords[CR]Go to 'vs' in the menu selection, then go to the 'password' menu. Input one of these codes:[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 1-P vs. Mode Passwords[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 1-P vs. Mode Passwords[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 1-P vs. Mode Passwords[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 1-P vs. Mode Passwords[CR]Go to the 1P menu, then 'stage clear' and then to the password section. Enter one of the following to go to the corresponding level:[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 1-P vs. Mode Passwords[CR]After the title screen select 1 player game, then the fourth selection, then the second and enter the following chain.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 1-P vs. Mode Passwords[CR]After the title screen select 1 player game, then the fourth selection, then the second and enter the following chain.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 1-P vs. Mode Passwords[CR]After the title screen select 1 player game, then the third selection, then the second and enter the following chain.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 1-P vs. Mode Passwords[CR]Enter these at the 1P vs. password screen. When it says ERROR! keep pressing the B button to backup to the menu that says new game and password and select new game. Choose a difficulty level and start the game. Now when you loose it will say you have 43 or 90 continues.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Guaranteed Victory vs CPU[CR]If you have a controller with a "turbo" option for buttons A or B, you can use the following exploit against the CPU so that you [I]always[/I] win! [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Guaranteed Victory vs CPU[CR]First, when you turn on the game and Yoshi appears in front of a blue screen and says "Nintendo," press B, A, L, L. You should hear a confirmation code when you input the cheat correctly. This will remove the "freeze" that occurs when you or your opponent makes a combo or a chain. In other words, the blocks never stop rising. After entering the cheat, activate turbo for either A or B. Once you are competing against your CPU opponent in splitscreen, place your cursor over any two blocks or one block and an empty panel, and hold down turbo. The panels will switch back and forth so quickly that your blocks will not rise, nor will garbage blocks fall on you! Eventually, the speed of the rising blocks will surpass the CPU's ability to get rid of them and you will win! [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Guaranteed Victory vs CPU[CR]Although it takes a while in later stages, you can use this exploit to beat every difficulty in VS Mode.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Guaranteed Victory vs CPU[CR]In any of the sessions hold down the "R" button.  You can now control the cursor and try out the chains, combos, and skill chains on your own.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Guaranteed Victory vs CPU[CR]In Time Trial, you get progressively more and more points for larger chains until the 13x chain. However, if you keep a chain going any longer than the 13th link (x?), you don't get any chain-link bonus points. For this reason, you should never let a chain go past the 13th link in time trial.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Secret Character[CR]Go to the Player vs. Player character select screen, then hold L + R on both controllers for a few seconds. If you did it right, the question marks (?) at the bottom of the screen will be replaced by bosses.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] All Endings[CR]Good Ending: Beat the game using no continues.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] All Endings[CR]Bad Ending: Beat the game with at least one continue.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] All Endings[CR]After you've beaten the game on Medium difficulty or higher and the credits are rolling, hold SELECT and you can use the Control Pad to move Yoshi around in the background.</plot>

			<title_clean>Panic in Nakayoshi World</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Panic in Nakayoshi World is a 1994 Super Famicom puzzle game. The player controls one (or one pair in two-player mode) of characters from either Sailor Moon, Goldfish Warning!, Chou Kuse ni Nariso ("I'll Make a Habit of It") or Kurumi to 7 Ninnokobitotachi ("Kurumi and the 7 Dwarves") - who collectively represent the Japanese shoujo (young girl's) serial manga magazine and game's namesake Nakayoshi ("Good Friend"). The game uses a top-down perspective and contains modes for both competitive and co-op two-player.[CR]Panic in Nakayoshi World did not receive an official localization but it did receive a fan translation in 2000.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The goal is to save various VIPs from the Nakayoshi multiverse from harm by defeating enemies on their behalf and escorting them to the exit once it appears. The player character can shoot creatures and blocks - destroying the latter reveals power-ups similar to Bomberman - and must defeat ten of the fifteen monsters that spawn before any of them reach the VIP character. At this point the door opens that the player can escort the hostage to, or they can defeat the remaining five enemies to end the stage instantly. If the VIP or the player character gets hit by an enemy projectile (the VIP can also get hit by the player's projectiles), they'll either slow down or lose the ability to shoot. If the VIP gets touched by an enemy, the player must restart the stage.[CR]Each of the four worlds contain six stages: the first four are standard stages that require that the player(s) escort the VIP character to the exit. The fifth is a special bonus stage in which the player(s) can earn power-ups and extra lives by destroying blocks of chocolate within a short time limit. The sixth and final is a boss fight. The hostage does not follow the player(s) to these final two stages.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Passwords[CR]At the start screen select the first choice and on the next screen select the second.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Following the popularity of their own Gradius franchise, Konami took the basic concepts from those games, but added a healthy dose of weird to the characters, environments, and enemies. Parodius is a side-scrolling shooter at its heart. Players use their ships to blast wave after wave of enemies, collecting powerups that range from shields to missles to, in the case of Parodius, heat-seaking octopi. A lot of characters in the game come from various Konami franchises, as well as popular characters in Japanese culture and history. It is a very deliberate send-up of Gradius, with menu options including "One Player", "Two Player" and "Lollipop", but is a very accomplished version of the series at its heart which, despite the candy-coated visuals, zany characters and far out enemies, is a great game in its own right.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]While the only playable character in the Gradius series is the Vic Viper fighter, Parodius' selectable characters offer a bit more variety.TwinbeeTwinbee[CR]A small blue plane with two big fists on the front, Twinbee is the eponymous main character in its own series of games, the first of which was ported to the US and renamed as Stinger. In its games, Twinbee's powerups were granted by shooting bells that appear on the screen. The bells also appear in Parodius, supplying the player with a limited set of power-ups that work independently from the standard weapon powerups gained from blowing up enemy ships. Twinbee's powerups include rocket fists, which fly across the screen and slowly return to the plane, a forwards and backwards shot, a three-way shot, shadowed out copies of twinbee that fire and cannot be damaged, and a radial shield that offers a wide area of protection.Vic ViperVic Viper[CR]The Vic Viper is just about the only normal thing about Parodius. Its powerups match those found in Gradius. Included are missles that travel along the ground and ceiling, a double-shot, a laser beam, small glowing options which absorb bullets and fire when the Vic Viper fires, and a shield which blocks shots in front.TakosukeTakosuke[CR]Takosuke is a space-faring, headband-wearing octopus. He was created specifically for this game, and in a weird way fits into the game better because of it. His powerups include missles that fire straight up and down, a forwards and backwards shot, a wide-area ripple laser, little octopi that follow Takosuke around and fire when he does, and a jellyfish-shaped shield.PentarouPentarou[CR]Pentarou is a penguin, a penguin that travels through space and shoots out of his mouth and other places. His upgrades are missles that travel along the ground and ceiling, a double-shot, an exploding shot, small penguins that travel close to Pentarou and shoot when he does, and a bubble shield.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Option Cheats[CR]In the options screen, press the following buttons:[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Debug menu[CR]Highlight Octopus on the character selection screen, and hold Up+L+X for around 30 seconds. A menu will then be displayed allowing you to select your starting stage, scene, and ''Mutek'' (set it to 01 for a fully powered up, invincible ship)</plot>

			<plot>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.[CR]Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.[CR]Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</plot>

			<title_clean>Plok!</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Plok is a side-scrolling action platformer developed by Software Creations (later known as Acclaim Studios Manchester) which was released in 1993 on the SNES. The game is very similar to a lot of the other colorful character-driven platformers of its era, but it distinguished itself with its unique limb-throwing play mechanic and punishing difficulty.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The eponymous Plok.[CR]The game opens with Plok, king of the island of Akrillic in the Poly-Esta archipelago, waking up to discover that his Grandpappy&#8217;s flag which flew proudly over his home has been stolen. Spotting his flag flying on the nearby Cotton Island, Plok sets sail to retrieve it. Once on Cotton Island, Plok makes his way through a series of decoy flags before finally defeating the Bobbins Brothers and retrieving his family heirloom.[CR]Upon his return home, Plok discovers that the theft of his Grandpappy&#8217;s flag was simply for the purpose of luring him away from Akrillic so that it would be left defenseless for the Fleas to take over and raise their flags over the land in the place of Plok&#8217;s. Determined to reclaim his island, Plok sets out to rid the island of the Fleas and their allies. His quest eventually takes him to the depths of the Flea Pit where he must face off against the Flea Queen in order to determine the fate of Akrillic.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Plok engages in the game's first boss fight.[CR]Plok&#8217;s primary ability is that he is able to throw his arms and legs in a boomerang-like manner. This ability can be used both as an attack and to solve certain puzzles which involve Plok giving up a limb in order to activate a switch. With fewer limbs, Plok is less mobile and has less &#8220;ammunition&#8221; to attack with. Limbs used to activate switches can be retrieved from a hanger somewhere else in the level. Plok is also able to perform a spinning high-jump (very similar to Sonic the Hedgehog&#8217;s jumps) which allows him to reach platforms he can&#8217;t with his weak standard jump. After receiving an amulet later in the game, the high-jump can also be used as an attack.[CR]Plok proceeds from level to level via an overworld screen. The path is linear, but levels can be skipped by using warps throughout the game. Warp zones are accessed by hitting specific berries (usually just used to increase health) until they teleport Plok to the warp area. Once in the warp zone, a &#8220;Race Against Time&#8221; event will take place which challenges Plok to get some sort of vehicle through a special level and across the finish line in a limited amount of time. If Plok is successful, he&#8217;ll be transported ahead to a later level of the game, but if he fails, he&#8217;ll be spit back out in the same spot he entered the warp zone.[CR]The world of Poly-Esta is filled with many different items and power-ups for Plok to collect. Shells scattered throughout each level will net him an extra life if he can get enough. They can also be used to fuel his special high-jump attack after the amulet item is received later in the game. Additionally, Plok collects the letters P-L-O-K in order to get &#8220;Plokontinues&#8221; which allow him to continue his journey if he loses all of his lives. Every time Plok defeats a Rockyfella, it will drop a ruby which grants Plok invincibility for a short time. The Razor Wheel pickup will transform Plok into an invincible spinning steel blade that storms through the world with incredible speed. Presents hidden in the world allow Plok to temporarily don one of many costumes that grant him special abilities.[CR]Development History[CR]The character of Plok was originally developed during the late 80&#8217;s by brothers John Pickford and Ste Pickford. The character&#8217;s introduction to the public was to be as the star of a Zippo Games developed coin-op game titled Fleapit, but unfortunately after the game was about half complete it was put on hold and eventually disappeared with the closing of the studio. The Pickford brothers however managed to retain the intellectual property rights to the basic game and character design. This allowed them to commence with development of another similar title that would eventually become the 1993 title Plok.[CR]Game Reception[CR]When the Pickford brothers were first developing Fleapit (the game that would become Plok) during the late 80&#8217;s, the gaming landscape was ripe for an inventive, cute, colorful, character-driven platformer to come along and explode with popularity. However, during the early 90&#8217;s the video game market experienced a massive flood of colorful character-driven platform titles such as Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind, Rayman, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Zool. Thus, by the time Plok was finally released in 1993, it didn&#8217;t seem nearly as fresh as it was when development first started nearly five years ago. Reviews for the game were overall very favorable, but commercially the game was received very poorly and sales were underwhelming. There just wasn&#8217;t enough to distinguish this game from all of the others that appeared so similar. The game has also at times been criticized because of its difficulty and lack of a save or password system.[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the scores of 7,8,9 and 8 with "Sushi-X" exclaiming, "...Plok has got to be one of the most unique games to come out in a while." Ed Semrad wrote, "...while the bosses aren't anything to write home about, the actual game is visually stunning. The challenge level is really high, possibly turning off younger players, but hard-core gamers will love it".[CR]		</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pokonyan! Henpokorin Adventure is a platformer game for the Super Famicom that was published by the Japanese TV and movie company Toho. It is based on the long-running anime TV show Pokonyan! which depicted on the adventures of a cat/tanuki hybrid who was able to change his shape with his mysterious "Henpokorin" power similar to the shapeshifting abilities of the mythical tanuki. It was licensed outside of Japan as Rocky Raccat!.[CR]In-game, animals have stolen the sweet treats of Pokonyan's human friend Miki Konoha (known as Amy in the Rocky Raccat version) and Pokonyan quickly pursues them. Pokonyan collects food items along the way - each of which adds to a bonus after the stage is complete - and Pokonyan can jump, sprint and change shape with his powers. His other forms give him stronger jumping and attacking capabiltiies, depending on the shape.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Popeye Ijiwaru Majo: Sea Hag no Maki ("Popeye and the Harassing Witch Sea Hag") is a Popeye platformer-action game from Technos Japan. After Popeye trounces his nemesis the Sea Hag, she gets her revenge by separating all of Popeye's friends from their lifeforce, causing them to turn to stone. Popeye has to recover all their life energy (in the form of hearts) from a board game-like grid while avoiding the various heavies that have been sent to deter him, including his rival Bluto who is hoping to win Olive Oyl's heart by rescuing her first.[CR]The game was released only in Japan for the Super Famicom.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Each stage takes place in a grid, and Popeye moves around by rolling a die and moving one to six spaces around the board. Some tiles allow him to purchase upgrades, recover health, move to other map squares and play through small platforming sequences. Occasionally, Popeye can bump into moving enemies on the map (similar to the overworld enemies in Super Mario Bros. 3) and fight a quick one-on-one battle with them for bonuses. His goal is to land on every square with a heart on it and find the heart in the stage somewhere. By collecting them all, Popeye saves a friend and moves onto the next board.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Level Passwords[CR]At the password screen, enter the following character's portraits to go to the desired level. The order of each portrait is as follows: Popeye, Olive Oyl, Swee'pea, Wimpy, Eugene The Jeep, Pappy, Granny, Nana Oyl, Marsman, Emok, Dufus, Alice The Goon, Blozo, Bernard, Bluto, Sea Hag</plot>

			<title_clean>Popful Mail</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Popful Mail is a 2D side-scrolling action game from Nihon Falcom, the creators of Ys and Dragon Slayer. It features Mail, an overambitious elven bounty hunter, and her two companions Tatt (a naive wizard's apprentice) and Gaw (a small, bat-like dragon) that the player can switch between as soon as those characters have joined the party. The game plays similarly to Wonder Boy in Monster Land, or Falcom's own Legacy of the Wizard or Ys III, with characters exploring each stage and defeating enemies to earn money which can then be spent on better equipment or curative consumables.[CR]Originally released in 1991 for the NEC PC-9801 home computer, Falcom would eventually publish a version for the Super Famicom in 1994. The same year, Sega published a version for the Sega CD (which would later be published in the US by Working Designs in 1995) and NEC did the same for the PC Engine CD.[CR]The PC-9801 and PC Engine CD games are almost identical, though the latter benefits from the CD storage with its improved graphics, cutscenes and redbook audio. The Sega CD version increases the size of the playable character and emphasizes the combat and platforming, while streamlining the exploration aspects and aging up the cutesy characters for cutscenes. The Super Famicom version is similar to the Sega CD version, but lacks a lot of features (including the animated, voiced cutscenes) due to the limitations of the platform.</plot>

			<plot>"Legend of Another World" one of Gainax' popular "princess-breeding simulation" games, similar to  Princess Maker 2, but more medieval and fantasy-like. You have to determine the future of a little princess. Fill up the schedule for her, buy her weapons and armor, train her in combat, make her study and prove she is worthy of her title. Or just let her eat and sleep all day and see how she gets lazier and dumber day by day. In the end, your actions will determine the outcome of the story - the girl will become a fighter, a great painter, a good-for-nothing bimbo... it's all up to you.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Princess Minerva: Hime no Wagamama Daibouken was first created by RED Company and Riverhill Software and released on the PC-98 in 1992.[CR]A somewhat different game was developed for the PC Engine CD in 1994. This version sported animated CG cutscenes as well as voice acting. It also had a unique element where 3 parties of 3 would travel together, and one of them would be selected at random to take part in each regular battle, ensuring the need to keep all 9 characters leveled and well-equipped at all times.[CR]In 1995, the PCE version was ported by Vic Tokai to the Super Famicom, but because of the space limitations of the cartridge, all of the voice acting and nearly all the CG was cut out. A number of enemy sprites were also removed, and replaced with palette swaps of other regular enemies.[CR]Censorship[CR]The PC Engine CD version of Princess Minerva featured several scenes of nudity, both of Minerva and company, as well as the primary villainess, Dynastar, and her minions. In the Super Famicom port, scenes were modified so that the protagonists remain clothed, and numerous enemy sprites were edited so their nipples were no longer visible.[CR]The PC-98 version, in a rare and unusual case, was not as racy as the PC Engine CD entry.[CR]	</plot>

			<plot>John Madden Football '93 is a Sports game, developed by EA Canada and published by Electronic Arts,which was released in 1992.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Easy defense[CR]Take control of your fastest defender and line him up directly in between the offense's guard and center, but a hair above where they are standing. If done correctly, you will not be called offsides when the play begins. The line of scrimmage in Madden 93 is parallel to the feet of the offensive lineman as opposed to the ball, which is why you're able to line up so close to the offense in the first place.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Easy defense[CR]When the ball is snapped, you'll usually have plenty of time to blast your defender through the line untouched, and you'll be able to stop virtually every play in the game.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dream Probe is a platformer, originally released in Japan under the title "Psycho Dream". Though the English version called Dream Probe was cancelled, it was advertised and reviewed. The cancellation came shortly after SEGA bought the game's original publisher, Renovation, with some speculating that SEGA did not want to fund any game to be released on the competing SNES.[CR]The game itself has the player controlling a prominent U.S. scientist who has invented a dream machine. After a young girl becomes trapped within the machine you follow her into six of her dreams in an attempt to rescue her. Strangely, most of her dreams are about futuristic cities filled with cybernetic enemies.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly issued the scores of 5,6,5,5 adding, "...there is a good variety of levels with plenty of nice scenery to look at, but when you play the game you find the power-ups are rather mild and the bosses slow down the game too much".[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Level Select[CR]Upon starting the game, hold Y, X, R, and Start on Controller 2 until the Riot logo fades out. Select either Start or Continue on the title screen to access the level select screen. Press Up or Down to select your level and Y to start.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]RPM: Radical Psycho Machine Racing is an isometric racing game from Silicon &amp; Synapse, currently known as Blizzard Entertainment. RPM puts players in customizable cars that drive around isometric tracks. By using the D-pad to incrementally change the car's heading, the player can maneuver around corners and avoid opponents and obstacles on the track. Too many collisions causes the player's car to explode, which takes them out of the race for a few seconds before they can respawn.[CR]The game was based on the earlier EA racing title Racing Destruction Set. A planned sequel, RPM II, would eventually become Rock 'n Roll Racing and focus more on the combat elements, as well as adding a sci-fi presentation and SNES renditions of famous rock music.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ranma 1/2: Akanekodan-teki Hihou ("Ranma 1/2: Secret Treasure of the Red Cat Gang") is a turn-based RPG based on the Ranma 1/2 franchise. The player, as Ranma, must locate the titular gang in order to recover his father Genma, who spends most of the game in his panda form.[CR]Ranma ends up recruiting various friends, fiances and recurring foes into his group to take down the interloping organization. Almost every character has a "cursed form", many of which change the abilties at the character's disposal. Ranma, for instance, changes into a female version of himself when doused with cold water but suffers no adverse effects from this transformation as far as combat goes. Others transform into weaker or stronger creatures.[CR]Akanekodan-teki Hihou is the third Ranma 1/2 game for the Super Famicom and the first to not receive a US localization. It is also the first game that didn't belong to the fighter genre. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ranma 1/2: Akanekodan-teki Hihou is a traditional turn-based RPG. Each character fights using their martial arts, taking turns based on a speed stat. While wandering around town looking for clues behind the Red Cat Gang, the player encounters enemies to fight.[CR]The player can recruit the following characters:Ranma Saotome: Ranma is the permanent leader of the group and is a good all-round fighter with an emphasis on powerful attacks. His female form, Ranma-chan, has identical stats.Akane Tendo: Ranma's fianc&#233;e (one of them, at least) and another moderately strong fighter with healing abilities. She's also a semi-permanent member and joins the party from the offset. She doesn't have a cursed form.Shampoo: Another of Ranma's fianc&#233;es. She has lower stats but much higher speed which, in combination with her healing abilities, makes her a useful support unit. She transforms into a cat, but suffers no ill effects in combat.Ryoga Hibiki: Ranma's self-described rival, though Ranma considers him unworthy. In-game, Ryoga is a powerhouse who usually ends up as the party's muscle. His cursed form, a tiny black pig called P-Chan, prohibits him from using most of his techniques.Genma Saotome: Ranma's lackadaisical father, who usually spends his time in his cursed form as a panda bear. Though he has tank-like stats, his techniques are generally less effective. This is in reference to the joke side of his character, as he was quickly surpassed by his own child during Ranma's training.Mousse: Another of Ranma's rivals, who suffers terrible eyesight problems despite his martial prowess. His cursed form is that of a duck, who can only use a handful of techniques.[CR]							</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ranma 1/2: Chougi Ranbu Hen ("Ranma 1/2: Super-Skill Wild Dance Chapter") is a 2D fighter game for the Super Famicom and the fourth of five SFC games to be based on the Ranma 1/2 license, about a martial artist who is cursed to switch genders when soaked with water, and his equally eccentric neighbors many of which have curses of their own.[CR]The story involves a magical wish-granting Maneki-Neko that is separated into a dozen pieces across the world. Twelve determined fighters from Ranma's immediate circle race off to find and unite them.Characters[CR]The game features the following characters as fighters:Ranma Saotome: The protagonist, a powerful if oblivious martial artist that is cursed to become a woman if drenched in cold water.Ranma (Female): As is usual for Ranma 1/2 fighter games, Ranma's female form is also a separate fighter with the same moves but is slightly faster and less strong.Genma Saotome: Ranma's irascible and insensitive father is once again fighting in his panda form.Akane Tendo: The scion of the Tendo martial artist academy and Ranma's primary love interest. She's another no-nonsense martial artist who fights her unwanted paramours to a pulp.Tatewaki Kuno: A posh upperclassman of Ranma's and frequently his rival. Wields a sword.Kodachi Kuno: Tatewaki's twin sister and equally supercilious. Uses her gymnastics in combat.Ryoga Hibiki: Ranma's self-proclaimed archnemesis and equally his peer, though somewhat clumsy and prone to getting lost. Is cursed to turn into an adorable (and harmless) black piglet when soaked.Shampoo: One of Ranma's unrequited love interests who is determined to marry him in order to fulfill her clan's tradition of marrying the man who defeats her in combat. She turns into a cat when soaked.Mousse: Shampoo's luckless former boyfriend who still carries a torch for her and is resentful at Ranma for "stealing her heart". Has severe eyesight issues but is still surprisingly strong, often pulling a lot of improvised weapons out of his sleeves.Ukyo Kuonji: An okonomiyaki chef and a childhood friend of Ranma. Wields a massive spatula.Hinako Ninomiya: A teacher with the body of a child. She can absorb auras to briefly turn into an adult and dispense justice to delinquent students.Mariko Konjo: A stereotypical cheerleader who fights opponents with pom-poms and chants. Mariko makes her SFC video game debut with this game.Herb: A sadistic and ill-tempered Prince of an ancient dynasty of Warrior Kings, he is one of the most ruthless martial artists in the world and is capable of turning into a dragon. He is the game's antagonist and also makes his SFC debut with this game.[CR]								</plot>

			<plot>The last Megaman game in the "true" Megaman series, this actually came after Megaman 8, and leans towards its slightly more realistic style, instead of the much more cartoony look that MM7 had. I mean seriously, compare the way Megaman looked in both games. Honestly, guys.[CR]I haven't gotten into this game much, but my roommate has, and he tells me that Astroman is a total bastard. The cool thing about this game is that you can play as either Megaman or as Bass. Both have different characteristics, which makes playing each character a really different experience. Like, Megaman can charge his blaster, and Bass can fire in all (eight) directions. Pretty neat? Damn right it's neat.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]Aside from a minor graphic, everything is translated and very enjoyable. Fixing this graphic isn't really an issue, it's just that satsu is L-A-Z-Y. So la.[CR]Guys, this is the translation you want to go with. Even the elusive CD Database is completely translated. There's even two different patches in the zip, depending on whether you prefer the Japanese or American naming conventions (ie. Rockman vs. Megaman, Blues vs. Protoman, Forte vs. Bass, etc.) Absolutely beautiful.[CR]Speaking of different patches, use RMF-E.IPS if you want the Japanese names. Use MMB-E.IPS if you want the American names. Why Capcom always has to change the names I dunno, I always thought Biohazard was a cool name for a video game.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Erase CDs Code[CR]To erase the CDs that are in your data base highlight Continue on the start screen and press and hold the L, R, Select, and Start buttons until the screen changes and you hear a chime. You can now either choose to erase your CDs by pressing the Y button or choose to keep them by pressing the B button (you'll hear different chimes for each option).[CR]Reviewer: Spinner 8[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/621/[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Erase CDs Code[CR]To erase the CDs that are in your data base highlight Continue on the start screen and press and hold the L, R, Select, and Start buttons until the screen changes and you hear a chime.

			<plot>Mega Man 7 is an Action game, developed and published by Capcom,which was released in Japan in 1995.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Different Shade Man Music[CR]For different music for the Shade Man level highlight his level, press and hold the B button, and then select his level. You must not have defeated Shade Man for this to work.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Different Shade Man Music[CR]First, go to ProtoMan's room in CloudMan's stage (right before the outdoor part before the boss, there will be a ladder. Use Rush to get to it). ProtoMan will comment about using weapons to find areas. Then go to ProtoMan's room in TurboMan's stage (this one is at the very top of the area with the traffic light platforms; go through the wall just before you reach the top of the ladder). He will mention something about the Super Adaptor.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Different Shade Man Music[CR]After you go to these two rooms (doesn't matter with order you go to those), go to ShadeMan's stage. Continue like normal until you reach the Pumpkin mini-boss. Shoot the small orange core of the Pumpkin (NOT the eyes on the outside). After you defeat it, it will open a hole on the bottom. Go down until you reach the room with a lone green Sniper Joe. Defeat the Sniper Joe, and instead of going down the ladder, go right through a secret passage and enter the gate you find. If you did everything correctly, ProtoMan will challenge you to a duel.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Different Shade Man Music[CR]Once you defeat ProtoMan, he will give you the ProtoShield. This can be used at the same time as the MegaBuster (don't forget to select it), and it will block many enemy shots (like those birds that hatch from the egg; let all of them run into the shield and they will die).[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Different Shade Man Music[CR]Enter the following password: 1415 5585 7823 6251 [CR]Then press and hold R &amp; L, and push the start button.

			<plot>Near the end of his life, Dr. Light succeeds in creating the first of a new series of robots which will change the world. Able to think and make decisions, this new robot holds great danger as well as great possibilities. Fearful of the possible consequences of unleashing his creation on the world, Dr. Light decides to seal him in a capsule and test his systems until they are totally reliable. The future will have to decide his fate...Released from the capsule by Dr. Cain, 'X' is born into the world of the future where the robot rebellions are a thing of the past. But when Dr. Cain tries to implement Dr. Light's designs into a new series of Reploids, something goes hideously wrong. Now the future lies on the brink of destruction and a new Mega Man must emerge to face Sigma and his forces before the human race is wiped from the planet![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Misc. Passwords[CR]Select the password option at the title screen and enter the following in the 3X4 grid, inputting the password from left to right, starting from the top left corner: [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Glitched Password[CR]This password has four known effects depending on how you execute it - the password is 7443 2241 1221. Regardless of what you do, it will sound as a "wrong" password, but the effects take effect nonetheless. If you enter the password without going into the demo, the game will hang upon gameplay beginning. If you enter the black screen moments prior to the demo, then go on and enter the password, you simply start with 10 health. If you go into the demo once, then exit it and enter the password, you'll start with all weapons, 32 health, and zero lives. Finally, if you enter the demo, wait it out, then press Start in the black screen prior to a second demo, you can enter the password to start with 10 health and all weapons.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Glitched Password[CR]Get three sub-tanks and make sure one of your special weapons has less than full power. Then, with the weapon that has less than full power selected, grab a weapon capsule and immediately hit start. If you did it right, you'll have a fourth sub-tank. Fill it using the same method, just don't over fill or you'll delete it and your third one. It recovers health just like the a normal one.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Zeros Buster[CR]This is done by not getting the arm Power up in Flame mamoth's stage. [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Mega Man Fireball[CR]Must have Heart Tanks, Sub-Tanks, enemy weapons, and power-ups.  Then, go to Armored Armadillo's level. Reach the final mine cart, which launches you through the air at the end of the level.  Just before you reach the wall, jump up and climb the wall.  At the top, there will be a large Energy Unit.  Get it, and then jump into the pit and die.  Repeat this step five times.  On the fifth time through, a capsule will appear on that same ledge.  Dr. Light will then give you a Ryu-style fireball for Mega Man to use.  [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Mega Man Fireball[CR]Some stages are a little different if you beat a certain boss first. If you beat Chill Penguin, the Lava in Flame Mammoth's stage will be frozen. If you beat Storm Eagle, the lights in Spark Mandrill's stage will flicker on and off. If you beat Launch Octopus, Sting Chameleon's stage will be partially flooded.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Mega Man Fireball[CR]Dash while firing your uncharged X-Buster to cause the shot to deal double damage.  This is useful when you don't have time to wait for a shot to charge.</plot>

			<plot>Just when Mega Man X thought he had brought down all the X-Hunters, several months later an uprising moves from within an abandoned factory. While 8 all-new X-Hunters occupy Mega Man X, a triple threat plots to resurrect a secret weapon that is all too familiar!The good Dr. Light supplies Mega man X with incredible new abilities hidden in capsules buried deep below the surface. And with new vehicles like the mobile attack cycle plus powers he gains from the X-Hunters, Mega Man X will be ready to face his destiny as a Maverick Hunter. Now it's all or Zero for Mega Man X![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Disappearing Enemies[CR]This will work with almost any enemy that can be frozen with the Crystal Hunter. Freeze the enemy with a normal shot then pause the game. Now at the pause menu select the X. Buster and hit start. The enemy that was frozen will no longer be there.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Disappearing Enemies[CR]To do this trick, you must have all of Zero's parts and the Flaming Dragon Punch. First, go to the last Sigma stage. Right before you enter the room where Sigma drops in, stop. Dragon Punch your way in and try to land where Zero will punch his hole after the dialogue. If done correctly, X will fall through the hole when Zero punches it out. When Zero starts talking, do not let his dialogue disappear. Leave it there until X lands in Sigma's room. When Sigma enters, make Zero's dialogue go away and X should be able to walk over to Sigma. Have X stand right by Sigma, and when Sigma begins to fill up his energy meter, Dragon Punch him.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Disappearing Enemies[CR]When the fight begins, Sigma should not be able to harm you no matter what he does, making it easy for you to conserve you SubTanks and energy for the second battle. Also, this glitch makes your charged shots look a vibrant reddish-pink color.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Disappearing Enemies[CR]It will stay this way until the second Sigma battle begins. Also, using the Giga Crush causes your X-Buster shots to go back to their original color.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Kens Shoryuken![CR]Megaman can use Ken's Shoryuken if you get all of the energy tanks, all of the hearts, and all of X's parts. The capsule for the shoryuken is in the third x-hunter stage (Agile). At one point in his stage, there is a ladder with many bats around.  Use the Crystal Hunter to crystalize a bat to reach the ladder. Follow the path until you reach a downward path. Scroll on the left side of the path until X discovers a passage. You must be at full power for the capsule to appear.  Dr. Light will give you Ken's Shoryuken.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Diagnostics Test[CR]To see the Mega Man X2 diagnostic test, hold the B button on controller 2, then turn on your system. Keep holding until the test appears on screen. [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Diagnostics Test[CR]There are two hidden features in the ending, which are triggered from different variables. The first and most obvious difference is whether or not all of Zero's parts were collected from the X-Hunters; if the player didn't collect them, Zero will be fought and a black copy of Zero will appear in the ''Thanks for playing!!'' screen, but if they were found then Zero will not be a boss and the real one will take the fake's place. Another difference is whether or not the player collected any upgrades from capsules - if Mega Man X has no additional armor, Zero will appear for a moment when the cast roll transitions to the boss list, otherwise he will be missing (hearts and tanks are not factored).</plot>

			<plot>Mega Man X and his trusty partner Zero have a new force to reckon with. Who or what has caused a riot of Mavericks to break out in the experimental utopia known as Doppler Town?Named after the scientist reploid, Doppler Town was supposed to be a place where humans and reploids could live in harmony. After discovering a virus that was turning reploids to Mavericks, Doppler's anti-virus was a big success. But Doppler itself became infected with the virus and assembled a team to take out the Maverick Hunter Units. The Doppler Effect is about to unfold, with Mega Man X and Zero the only cure for the deadly virus![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Code or Password for Megaman X3[CR]All armor parts,all enemy skills,all sub-tanks,all heart tanks,all ride armors and no enhance chip aquire, so you can still have the change to obtain the gold armor in doppler stage.The stage start at where Doppler stage just shown out at the MAP selection screen[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Code or Password for Megaman X3[CR]Depending on Zero's status in the game, you can have different endings and a different charge on your Buster.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Cx4 test[CR]Hold B on controller 2, then turn on the power of the Super Nintendo to view the stats of the game's Cx4 chip.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Cx4 test[CR]1) After defeating the first two mavericks, you will now be able to access Vile's mini stage through the funny looking teleporter in the Volt Catfish, Crush Crawfish, or Blizzard Buffalo stages. Go there. You MUST defeat Vile with either Crush Crawfish's or Neon Tiger's weapon, and then quickly make your way out of the stage before the timer reaches zero. This trick will not work if you do not follow this step.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Cx4 test[CR]2) Complete the rest of the stages. Although it is not required, you should find all of the Upgrades, E-Tanks, Heart Tanks, and Robot Armor pieces. Make it all the way to Doppler Fortress Level 2. If you completed Step 1 correctly, this level should be alot harder now, as the stage will be filled with water and different enemies.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Cx4 test[CR]3) Right before the first sub-boss door, switch to Zero. Go inside, and defeat the bug robot. He's not too difficult...stay toward the center, then when he comes towards you, dash under him, and he should land on the ground behind you, then shoot him. After you defeat the bug robot, it will land on Zero, damaging him badly. At this point, he will give Mega Man his Z-Sabre to use for the rest of the game.

			<plot>"Ruin Arm" tells the story of a young boy named Arm, who lives together in Arff Village together with his father Borgan, his sister Linda, and the talking bird Lucia. Proud of the warrior traditions of their family, Borgan sends Arm to retrieve a powerful sword from the depths of the dungeon Arff. When Arm returns home, he finds the village attacked by soldiers from as hostile empire. His father loses his memory, and he has to find a magical herb to cure him. The king of Rondium and his court magician send Arm and Linda on a quest to find out more about the attack, and Arm discovers the secrets of the ancient Mediom empire and its evil emperor.[CR]This is an action RPG in which you control Arm and his party. You can either let the computer AI handle the actions of the other characters, or control them on your own, one at a time. In battles, characters have their own attacks: Arm uses physical attacks, Linda casts magic, etc. The dungeons are complex, and many of them have puzzles that you can solve by making two characters co-operate.</plot>

			<plot>A classic 2-player scrolling beat 'em up is back on the Virtual Console service! People are going missing in Bayside City and the rumors say someone conducting a shady human cloning experiment is responsible. For Rick (a.k.a. Hack) and Doug (a.k.a. Slash) this situation has become personal. Especially after three friends from their martial arts gym get abducted. The duo set off to the enemy's secret air fortress to sort this out. These guys know all the moves, from martial arts to pro wrestling throws, and they don't hesitate to use them. They&#8217;re not afraid of using knives, bats, and other things they find to get the job done. And if that wasn&#8217;t enough, when they get hurt they get angry&#8212;and you really don&#8217;t want to mess with them then. They ignore damage and hit even harder than usual! They&#8217;re ready for the action. The question is: are you?[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Codes[CR]During the character select screen press and hold the following:Down+L+R and select your character. You now have access to all your hidden special attacks and desperation attack.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Codes[CR]Constantly press B,A,X, and Y during the Jaleco logo until you reach the title screen. When successful you'll reach a black screen. It is actually the title screen. Press start once and then press up once to move to the options because you cannot see the screen properly. When you exit from the options the game will now change to "Brawl Brothers".[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Codes[CR]To play as the easier Japanese version, sequentially and repeatedly press B, A, X, Y at the white screen with the Jaleco logo until it disappears.

This also means that the player will be expected to perform different activities to successfully conclude the mission. The game's turn-based combat is depicted similarly to Phantasy Star and Dragon Quest: large enemy icons with the player's party's stats displayed underneath.[CR]The game was never released outside of Japan, but it did receive a fan translation from Aeon Genesis.[CR]		</plot>

			<title_clean>Samsara Naga 2</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sansara Naga 2 is a turn-based RPG from Victor Entertainment and the sequel to the 1990 Famicom RPG Sansara Naga. The player is the scion of a dragon-raising clan and must chase after a villainous member of their tribe who has stolen a precious artifact important to the training of dragons. Along the way, the player can raise their own dragons, which help the hero (or heroine) in combat. Post-battle monster remains can be fed to the dragons to restore their HP and MP, or be held onto to sell later.[CR]Like the prior game, Sansara Naga 2 never saw a western localization. However, it has yet to receive a fan translation, unlike the first game. Both it and its predecessor were packaged together for a GBA compilation in 2001.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sangokushi Seishi: Tenbu Spirits ("Romance of the Three Kingdoms True History: Tenbu Spirits" where tenbu is the Japanese word for the Buddhist term "deva", or higher being) is a strategy simulation game set during the Three Kingdoms era of Ancient China, based specifically on the novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The player assumes the role of a warlord and conquers territory from rival kingdoms. Unlike most games of its type, the campaigns play out in real-time and requires that players remain vigilant. [CR]The game is based on Wolf Team's earlier game Tenbu: Sangokushi Seishi for the NEC PC-9801, which had many sequels on the same platform. Tenbu Spirits is an enhanced port built specifically for the Super Nintendo. A Sega CD variant, Tenbu: Mega CD Special, was created the previous year. [CR]	</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sanrio Shanghai is a mahjong solitaire licensed game that uses the world of Sanrio characters, such as Hello Kitty, KeroKeroKeroppi and others, for the various tiles that the player must remove. The game features a few modes: a single-player, and two competitive two-player modes. One of these multiplayer modes involves alternating turns, while the other has each player solve as much of the grid as possible within a time limit before switching over.[CR]As with most Sanrio licensed games, Sanrio Shanghai is intended for younger audiences, with its simple difficulty and big, colorful tiles. It was only released on the Super Famicom and never saw an English localization.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]SD Gundam Gaiden: Knight Gundam Monogatari: Ooinaru Isan is an RPG based on the SD Gundam franchise, which itself a part of the much larger Gundam franchise. Knight Gundam re-imagines the mechs of the Gundam universe as living creatures that co-exist with humans in a fantasy world full of medieval castles and monsters. The heroic Knight Gundam must fight the evil Satan Gundam before he can enact his plan to kill off all the humans.[CR]The game is an otherwise traditional JRPG, with stats and equipment and leveling-up. The turn-based combat is reminiscent of Dragon Quest, with enemies standing before the party.[CR]A sequel entitled SD Gundam Gaiden 2: Entaku no Kishi was released in 1992.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]SD Gundam Gaiden 2: Entaku no Kishi is a RPG based on the SD Gundam sub-franchise of the famous anime and toyline series of Gundam. It is the sequel to the Super Famicom game SD Gundam Gaiden: Knight Gundam Monogatari: Ooinaru Isan, which is itself a sequel to the Famicom game SD Gundam Gaiden: Knight Gundam Monogatari. As with those games, the player assumes the role of an anthropomorphized version of the Knight Gundam in a fantasy kingdom where monsters and evil anthropomorphized Gundam run amok.[CR]The SD Gundam Gaiden games are essentially Dragon Quest clones, down to its first-person turn-based combat system, but with Gundams. This is also the case for the SD Gundam: Knight Gundam manga that the games are based on.</plot>

			<plot>There is one force in the universe that keeps good and evil in perfect balance. It is called the tree of Mana. But a magic sword has tricked a young warrior into upsetting the balance, spreading evil throughout the land. Thus the warrior must undertake a dangerous journey to find the seeds of the Mana tree which has been hidden for centuries. Only then can perfect harmony be restored. In this incredible adventure, things are not as they seem. It's a world turned upside down that you must help the warrior make right. And the only way to succeed is to solve the Secret of Mana.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 9th Sword Orb[CR]Here is how to get the "Mana Sword" permanently, and without a cheating device![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 9th Sword Orb[CR]Fly to the ice country on Flammie and look for a small circular island off the immediate coast (trial and error are best here, but its NOT those little itty bitty ice chunks everywhere). You'll know its the right island if you are in a frozen grove with Neko surrounded by purple crystals (this looks like the same area you may encounter Neko on the way to the Ice Palace to fight Frost Gigas). [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 9th Sword Orb[CR]After that, Save the Game with Neko.[CR]Immediately after, do a soft reset (L + R + Select + Start).[CR]Start a New Game, and get to the Mantis Ant fighting as few (i.e. none) Rabites as possible. When you and Elliot take a dive into the pit, wait for him to say "You've got a sword don't you, use it!" [CR][B]WHILE THIS TEXT IS ON THE SCREEN[/B], perform another soft reset. [B]BE SURE TO HOLD THOSE FOUR BUTTONS FOR 5+ SECONDS[/B].  I don't know why those 5+ seconds are required, but they are. [CR]When you get back to the title screen, load the game you saved with Neko in the Ice Country. If you did the trick correctly, all three of your characters will be in the pit fighting the Mantis Ant! (If you did it wrong, you'll stare at a blank black screen and the game will freeze) Kill the weak boss (took me one hit...), and collect your "1st" sword orb again. Jema will pull you out and Timmy will call you to the elders house. Rather than risk a crash, call Flammie and high tail it to the nearest Watts location.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 9th Sword Orb[CR]You now have the most broken weapon in Secret of Mana at your disposal, without needing to cast Mana Magic ever again.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 9th Sword Orb[CR]*Final Note: This trick can be repeated if you wish, but do NOT forge your sword past level 9. The game will glitch and/or crash. You may get your Rusty Sword back, or you may corrupt your save file beyond repair.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 9th Sword Orb[CR]Whenever an enemy character casts an attack spell on you or an ally  use the pygmy hammer / moogle belt    on the  character being attacked ,  do this twice  before the  spell animation ends and if done correctly the character will completly avoid taking any damage.  This trick  is especially useful when you are fighting the Mana beast.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 9th Sword Orb[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 9th Sword Orb[CR]Most likely a glitch, but after acquiring Sylphid and the spell Analyzer, any chest you scan will be safe from traps, regardless whether or not the chest had a trap before that. This has only been confirmed to be the case in the English PAL version though.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 9th Sword Orb[CR]If you want to get back inside the village you were banished from, you must have all 3 characters.  Then walk up to the man blocking the entrance, and rapidly push the SELECT button while holding the UP button against the man.  Eventually you would will push your way through him, and be back into Potos Village.  Note that this trick might not work in escaping from Potos Village, so make sure you have the Flammie Drum before you attempt this.</plot>

			<title_clean>Seiken Densetsu 3</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Seiken Densetsu 3 is the third game in Square Enix's Mana series, following Final Fantasy Adventure and Secret of Mana. The game was released on September 30, 1995 for the Super Famicom in Japan, but was not released in the west. An unofficial English patch was made available on July 27, 1999.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]At the start of the game, the player is given the choice of whom he wants to have in his party: one protagonist and two allies, out of six total choosable characters. The story plays out differently depending on whom is in your party. Each character has his and her own set of abilities to use in battle. As the character levels up, you are prompted to invest points in one of the six different stats (strength, agility, vitality, intelligence, spirit, and luck). When the character reaches level 18, he can go to a mana stone in order to advance to another class -- either toward light or dark. The character may again change class upon reaching level 38 -- again, either toward light or dark. Take note however, in order for the second class to be open to the character, a special item is required. These combinations make up for a total of six different classes (seven including the original vanilla class). Each class grants the character bonus statistics and abilities otherwise non-attainable.A class tree showing the six different paths.The iconic ring menu[CR]As said previously, the player must form a party of three. During fights, he can control whomever he wants, while the other characters are AI-controlled (two other players can join the game if they each plug in a controller). Combat happens in real-time. After each attack, the character must wait approximately one second in order to strike at full potential once again. As your strikes connect and damage enemies, your special attack gauge will fill up. Once full, the player has the opportunity to initiate a more powerful special attack. The special attack is determined by which type of class the character occupies. Items and spells can be used by bringing up the " ring menu". When the menu is displayed on screen, combat freezes so the player can safely navigate through it. Once an item is consumed or a spell is cast, combat resumes. When all of the enemies have been defeated, a treasure chest may or may not appear. These chests contain rewards for the player and are sometimes trapped.[CR]Seiken Densetsu 3 employs a calendar system which affects gameplay in certain ways. There are seven weekdays -- each represented by an elemental spirit -- that cycle continuously. Each day's effect is as followed:Luna Day - Moon magic is slightly strongerSalamander Day - Fire magic is slightly strongerUndine Day - Water magic is slightly strongerDryad Day - Wood magic is slightly strongerJinn Day - Wind magic is slightly strongerGnome Day - Earth magic is slightly strongerMana Holy Day - All elemental magic is balanced. In addition you can sleep at an inn for free.[CR]Complementing the calendar system is a day/night cycle. Enemies vary depending on the time of the day, while shops are closed and others are open (such as the black market).[CR]Main Characters[CR]AngelaDuranHawkeyeRieszKevinCharlotte[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Faster Spells[CR]When you are in a battle and use magic from either your Magician or Cleric (or any other char that takes a long time to do a spell) press the item button and stay on the menu for around 3 sec.  When you go back to the battle, your character will use the magic without the waiting time.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mecarobot Golf is a golf game for the Super Nintendo that incongruously stars a humanoid golf-playing robot in the starring role. The story of the game makes it clear that Eagle, the robot, isn't allowed to play golf professionally despite being better at the sport than any human, so he is given access to a special golf course in order to prove his skills.[CR]The Japanese version of the game is called Serizawa Nobuo no Birdie Try, named for the Japanese golfer Nobuo Serizawa. Because he is far less famous in the West, he was changed to Eagle for the US release.[CR]The game is a traditional golf sim in that it depicts the action from behind the golfer and uses a sliding power meter to indicate the strength of the swing. The player can use the Lesson and Driving Range modes to practice their golfing before heading onto the Competition mode. The player can choose to play as Eagle (Serizawa in the Japanese version) or select between three fictional human avatars.[CR]		</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shanghai III is a Mahjong Solitaire tile game puzzle originally released in the Arcade in 1993, and later saw a Super Famicom port in 1994. The goal is to remove accessible tiles (those that have one of its sides free) from the grid in pairs, and to remove them all before the time limit expires.[CR]The game features twelve different tile formations, each of which represents a different animal on the Chinese zodiac: Dog, pig, rat, cow, tiger, rooster, hare, monkey, ram, horse, snake and dragon. Each presents their own difficulties with how their tiles are spread out. Players can also configure the game's settings to allow for more/less time, or more/fewer hints that will highlight possible tile pairs.[CR]Neither the Arcade game nor the Super Famicom adaptation were released outside of Japan.[CR]		</plot>

Normally, these Units cannot perform any super moves in the air or while jumping. This can be bypassed, however, by jumping and then inputting the command for the super (Usually: down, down-forward, forward x2) plus BOOSTER (any two attack buttons simultaneously except Buttons L and R) instead of pressing just one button! The Unit will perform the super but still be in the "standing-on-solid-ground" animation!</plot>

			<title_clean>Shin Megami Tensei</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]From the Mega CD intro[CR]Players take the role of a nameless high-school student who attempts to defend Tokyo from an invasion of demons that threaten to turn the city into the next battlefield for the endless struggle between the forces of Law and Chaos. There are a variety of demons based on several religious mythologies, and each family has its own racial alignment. Players will develop a Lawful, Chaotic or Neutral alignment over the course of the story, depending on the actions they take and the demons they befriend or fight. Different alignments will result in entirely different endings for the game, all of them equally valid - although the sequel assumes the player completed the Neutral ending.[CR]The story begins, after a strange dream sequence, with the discovery of a computer program e-mailed to the protagonist by a mysterious ally, allowing him to communicate with demons and summon ones allied with him via his hand-held computer, or COMP. Shortly afterward, missing persons are reported, fellow students go missing, and the protagonist is attacked by the demons which he so conveniently now has the capability of conversing with and summoning. Attempting to unravel the reasons behind all of this (and save Tokyo) is what makes up a majority of the story.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game's first-person dungeon crawling.[CR]Movement is split into two areas. When outdoors, the game presents an overhead view of a map of the local area, and the player can move the icon representing the protagonist around the streets and into buildings. Random encounters with demons begin to hinder your movement here after an early plot point. W hen indoors, all movement takes place in a first-person view remeniscent of old PC RPGs like Eye of the Beholder.[CR]Encounters with demons begin with an opportunity to attempt to talk before fighting. Depending on what the player says, the demons may decide to fight, run away, offer a bribe, or join the player's party and become an ally. What demons players battle and ally with will partially influence their alignment, which will affect how other demons react to them in the future. Demons whose alignment oppose the player will never join their party. Alignment can also affect what items can be equipped and what bosses are fought.A pixie appears![CR]Once combat is initiated, you select actions for each of your party members to take. Turns occur simultaneously for both sides, with each combatant taking their action in the order of initiative as determined by their speed and other similar factors. The protagonist cannot use any spells, but most of the other characters and demons have some form of magic at their disposal. Killing a demon nets you some experience and money, and each time you gain enough experience to increase your level, you can select a character stat to increase. Although spells are specific to each character, all other statistics are determined by you during the dream sequence, which means you can decide whether your team consists of glass cannon wizards or melee bruisers as you like. Players should take note, however, that this is an Atlus RPG and hence isn't very forgiving.[CR]There are also some stores in the city where you can purchase weapons, armor, or usable items as needed. A bit into the game, you can purchase some additional items with more useful traits, although they are very expensive.[CR]Demon Compendium[CR]Demons are ordered from highest level to lowest. Races are organized by affinity (Light-Neutral-Dark) and alignment (Law-Neutral-Chaos). Demons marked with (MCD) only appear in the Mega CD version of the game.Deity (L-L)82 Vishnu72 Indra70 Brahma(n) (MCD)64 Fudo Myo-o60 Baal (MCD)58 Odin51 Arahabaki42 Freyr (MCD)40 LokiMegami (L-L)64 Lakshmi50 Kikuri-Hime46 Urd (MCD)39 Sarasvati34 Verdandi (MCD)28 Kushinada-Hime22 Skuld (MCD)16 Ame no UzumeSeraph (L-L)96 Gabriel91 Raphael83 UrielDivine (L-L)67 Cherub61 Throne52 Dominion46 Virtue40 Power34 Archangel14 AngelAvian (L-L)72 Garuda65 Yatagarasu57 Phoenix52 Toufei (MCD)47 Jatayu36 Feng HuangHoly (L-L)41 Xuanwu38 Qilin31 Pabilsag22 Bai Ze17 UnicornAvatar (L-N)62 Barong55 Chimera54 Sphinx (MCD)52 Narasimha50 Pegasus (MCD)46 Bastet (MCD)42 NandiElement (L-N)40 Salamander30 Undine25 Sylph20 Gnome17 Flaemis14 Aquans11 Aeros8 ErthysOmega (L-C)88 Shiva80 Mahakala73 Wu Kong67 Indrajit60 Yama53 Ravana47 AgniKishin (L-C)75 Bishamonten68 Nio65 Take-Mikazuchi63 Kagutsuchi59 Jikokuten57 Koumokuten55 Zouchouten46 Nagasunehiko43 Take-Minakata38 Oumononushi31 Kotoshironushi23 HitokotonushiDragon (L-C)74 Ananta70 Tiamat (MCD)67 Maya62 Baek Yong56 Vritra49 Ganga44 CoatlicueYoma (N-L)63 Hanuman60 Ganesha58 Efreet (MCD)55 Kinnara52 Tengu50 Choronzon43 Ongkot41 Loa37 Watcher34 Isora21 Apsaras15 KinnariFlight (N-L)46 Siren34 Badb Catha18 Kokakuchou7 HarpyJirae (N-L)50 Atlas47 Giant43 Sarutahiko35 Kwancha26 Dwarf19 Buccaboo16 Tsuchigumo12 Fachen6 Kobold4 Knocker2 BrownieMessian (N-L)53 Scanner37 Magus22 Temple Knight18 AdeptFairy (N-N)64 Oberon61 Senko59 Cu Chulainn57 Dullahan (MCD)55 Tam Lin46 Troll40 Senri36 Hobgoblin30 Banshee (MCD)26 Elf23 Kelpie18 Rusalka15 Gandharvha14 Cait Sith (MCD)12 Dryad9 Pyro Jack8 Jack Frost6 Goblin2 PixieBeast (N-N)63 Great Pascal (MCD)50 Gryphon43 Cerberus43 Pascal (MCD)40 Rakcharango38 Orthrus35 Tammuz28 Stonka19 Nekomata16 Tanki12 Cu Sith8 SankiTouki (N-N)60 Talos (MCD)52 Yaksa50 Minotaur (MCD)46 Ne Zha40 Mezuki39 Gozuki30 Yaksini14 SpartoiLycan (N-N)41 Werewolf23 Werecat5 WeredogFemme (N-C)69 Kali61 Hariti56 Hel (MCD)54 Rangda49 Scylla45 Dakini39 Gorgon36 Taraka33 LamiaNight (N-C)62 Vampire54 Succubus49 Incubus44 Calon Arang35 Celuluk28 Lilim24 Nightmare14 Cyak7 ImpFallen (N-C)67 Sargatanas (MCD)66 Flauros63 Fleurety60 Abaddon57 Samael51 Marchosias48 Ose42 Decarabia39 Leonard35 Orobas31 Sitri27 Berith18 Forneus12 Gamigin8 AndrasSnake (N-C)61 Pendragon57 Yamata no Orochi53 Itzamna50 Quetzalcoatl46 Yurlungur41 Naga RajaBrute (N-C)49 Shuten-douji44 Turdak38 Ibaragi-douji34 Purski24 Momunofu13 Bogle10 AzumiGaean (N-C)56 Assassin52 Yamihoushi40 Onijorou27 Hakaisou20 Shokei Rider15 TokkoutaiVile (D-L)71 Taotie69 Seth (MCD)66 Orcus62 Tezcatlipoca55 Amon (MCD)44 MishagujiRaptor (D-L)53 Hresvelgr42 Gurr20 Furiae8 Fu XiJaki (D-L)53 Girimehkala51 Cyclops48 Rakshasa45 Barbegazi37 Lakhe28 Wendigo11 Orc8 Donkou5 GremlinMech (D-L)32 T95D25 T95C/P21 T93G15 Bitball11 Bigfoot2 DummyWilder (D-N)62 Fenrir51 Kraken47 Manticore44 Tamamo27 Atsuyu15 NueDead (D-N)18 Corpse10 Army Zombie7 Bodyconian6 Zombie Cop3 Obattallion2 Lady Zombie1 ZombieTyrant (D-C)99 Beelzebub95 Satanachia (MCD)90 Astaroth (MCD)87 Surt (MCD)85 Arioch (MCD)82 Mara80 Asmodeus (MCD)78 Bael77 Pazuzu (MCD)75 Mephisto (MCD)74 DagonDrake (D-C)60 Fafnir58 Midgardsormr (MCD)54 Serpent51 Basilisk43 Wyvern37 Wyrm30 Cockatrice22 WormHaunt (D-C)54 Lich46 Vetala40 Sunni Yaka35 Sawo Bhaku25 Baykok22 Man Eater17 Ghoul7 Oshichi5 PretaSpirit (D-C)44 Legion29 Phantom23 Larva19 Pisaca14 Lemur9 Shade4 GhostFoul (D-C)44 Backbeard32 Black Ooze13 Slime4 Mouryou2 Yakuza1 ThugFiend99 David99 Pale Rider99 DaisoujouBoss (1)10 Orias12 Ame no Sakugami15 Douman28 Gotou30 Thor32 Red Phantom32 Blue Phantom32 Zenki32 GokiBoss (2)43 Take-Minakata48 Arachne46 Nebiros52 Belial58 Security System70 Kazfiel80 Haniel77 Yama72 Nio71 Ladon81 Echidna92 Vishnu69 Ravana81 IndrajitBoss (3)96 Gabriel83 Uriel91 Raphael85 Arioch98 Astaroth100 Surt99 Law Hero99 Chaos Hero80 Lilith108 Beelzebub116 Michael110 Asura[CR]Translation into English[CR]The full translation patch for Shin Megami Tensei was released by Aeon Genesis on June 30th of 2002.

This can be done an infinite number of times to accrue large amounts of money.Repeating the same process, but substituting "Sell" with "Buy", one can purchase items one should not be able to purchase from that shop (such as a Hiko-Bari from the DRUGS shop in the Kichijouji arcade at the beginning of the game).***SPOILER*****Update**AS SOON AS YOU ARE ABLE TO ACCESS THE GAIAN TEMPLES YOU CAN USE THIS EXPLOIT WHEN YOU SELECT TO BUY ITEMS AND YOU WILL BE SOLD THE AME-NO-MURAKUMO FOR 0 MAKKA.</plot>

			<title_clean>Shin Megami Tensei if...</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shin Megami Tensei: if... is a spin-off of the Shin Megami Tensei series that was originally released by Atlus for the Super Famicom in 1994 and later remade for the PlayStation. The game's high school setting, story, and elements of its gameplay such as the use of guardian spirits that affect the player's stats would go on to mark the game as an early precursor to the Persona series. An English fan translation for the Super Famicom version of SMT: if... is currently being worked on by Aeon Genesis, who also created translation patches for the Shin Megami Tensei I and II.TitleThe title screen[CR]The subtitle if... has invited comparisons to the 1968 British film If...., a movie starring a young Malcolm McDowell. Like the Shin Megami Tensei game, the film's primary setting is a school; in this case, an all-boys private boarding school. However, rather than face demons or anything else supernatural, the primary antagonist of McDowell's character is the school itself; the film's climax sees him and his allies take up arms and mount a violent rebellion against the school's established elite.[CR]Though coincidences to compare the game and film are present, the title in actuality refers to the notion of the game's plot as a "what if" scenario, as implied in the various questions posited in the games opening and closing scenes ("What if... the school were thrown into a different reality?" etc.).Manga Adaptation[CR]The game also received a manga adaptation by Kazuaki Yanagisawa in the magazine Famicomi that ran from 1994 to 1995 and was subsequently released as a single volume. The manga received a sequel entitled Shin Megami Tensei: Khan that spanned nine volumes. The sequel was translated and published in North America by Tokyopop.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Hazama, the antagonist[CR]The primary character in Shin Megami Tensei: if... is a high school student at Karukozaka High School. The protagonist's name and gender are selected by the player at the game's start. As the game begins, the high school and everyone inside it are pulled into a demonic realm, and the school becomes linked with five different worlds based on five of the seven deadly sins. One of the other students, a boy named Hazama, takes credit for the event and asserts himself as the new ruler of the demonic realm. The protagonist must work with other students as well as demons in order to stop Hazama and escape the demon realm.[CR]At the beginning of if..., the player character much partner with one of the other students in the school. This choice determines certain storyline events and ultimately the ending that the player will receive.Connections to Persona[CR]The female protagonist later appears in both the original Persona and in the Persona 2 duology with the name Tamaki Uchida.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Fighting a Pixie, a traditional SMT demon[CR]Shin Megami Tensei: if... is, like earlier entries in the Shin Megami Tensei series, a party-based role-playing game in which exploration takes place from a first-person perspective. Battles are triggered through random encounters and are fought by selecting commands in a turn-based menu format. The player's party is comprised of fellow students as well as demons acquired through demon negotiation and fusion. The game also features a lunar cycle system as seen in other Megami Tensei titles. The phase of the moon changes gradually as the player explores the world, and the current phase affects the aggressiveness of demons and how willing they are to negotiate.[CR]A unique aspect of the game is triggered should the main character die. Upon dying, the protagonist will receive a guardian spirit that will alter the player's stats upon leveling up. The nature of this stat growth is affected by the type of enemy that was fought when the main character died, and it is possible for the character's stats to be affected negatively as a result.New Features[CR]Shin Megami Tensei: if... is the first game in the series to feature the spell Megidola, an "Almighty" spell that is unaffected by the standard elemental affinities. It is also the first game in the series to feature the -dyne level of magic, with spells such as Agidyne becoming the most powerful spells of their respective elements.[CR]Dungeons[CR]As previously stated, each of the dungeons linked to Karukozaka High School are based on five of the seven deadly sins, though six in total are represented. Hazama believes that these sins represent the flaws he sees in the students of the school. In the order in which the dungeons are visited, they are:PrideGluttonySlothEnvy/Wrath (The sin represented is dependent on the protagonist's human partner.)Greed[CR]The remaining sin, Lust, is not represented by a dungeon. However, the events of the game transpire after Hazama is rejected by the school nurse, Miss Kayama. Notably, Kayama is the only character that is never endangered by the goings on in the school, and the party is freely allowed to return to her to have their health restored. If the player is playing through the game with Reiko as his or her partner, the true final dungeon of the game is Hazama's mind.[CR]Demonic Compendium[CR]Seraph (L-L)Michael (73)Gabriel (68)Raphael (60)Uriel (51)Ophanim (46)Raguel (40)Tzaphkiel (35)Haniel (30)Remiel (29)Amatsu (L-L)Amaterasu (72)Tsukuyomi (62)Take-Mikazuchi (58)Hinokagutsuchi (49)Omoikane (41)Tajikarao (34)Ame no Torifune (30)Avian (L-L)Garuda (65)Zhu Que (47)Yatagarasu (44)Phoenix (37)Jatayu (32)Feng Huang (21)Suparna (16)Megami (L-N)Norn (61)Lakshmi (55)Parvati (50)Freya (43)Hathor (38)Arianrhod (35)Ame no Uzume (27)Deity (L-N)Ardha (85)Vairocana (81)Kalki (76)Baal (71)Odin (67)Horus (64)Thor (60)Indra (57)Belobog (45)Thoth (42)Avatar (L-N)Barong (56)Xuan Wu (48)Anubis (45)Narasimha (42)Sphinx (38)Sobek (25)Holy (L-N)Baihu (47)Pabilsag (40)Bastet (34)Apis (25)Unicorn (19)Heqet (17)Prime (L-N)Salamander (28)Undine (26)Sylph (24)Gnome (22)Flaemis (13)Aquans (12)Aeros (11)Erthys (10)Fury (L-C)Shiva (72)Susano-o (66)Indrajit (59)Wu Kong (53)Chernobog (46)Ares (33)Dragon (L-C)Ananta (69)Rahab (63)Itzamna (58)Qing Long (48)Quetzalcoatl (45)Baek Yong (41)Maya (39)Lady (L-C)Kali (74)Ishtar (70)Durga (59)Kikuri-hime (39)Taweret (25)Vesta (18)Kunitsu (L-C)Arahabaki (66)Take-Minakata (54)Oonamuchi (52)Kotoshironushi (44)Sarutahiko (43)Hitokotonushi (36)Sukuna Hikona (31)Ooyamatsumi (23)Divine (N-L)Dominion (52)Virtue (42)Power (36)Principality (31)Archangel (24)Angel (14)Holy Ghost (9)Flight (N-L)Morrigan (42)Macha (37)Nemhain (32)Aello (28)Celaeno (22)Ocypete (18)Bennu (9)Snake (N-N)Yamata no Orochi (59)Vritra (51)Raja Naga (44)Otohime (38)Mizuchi (34)Naga (25)Nozuchi (23)Yoma (N-N)Hanuman (60)Ganesha (57)Ifrit (50)Loa (47)Tengu (41)Jinn (36)Haokah (31)Isora (25)Apsaras (19)Kinnari (12)Beast (N-N)Griffon (50)Cerberus (43)Gdon (39)Selket (30)Orthrus (26)Nekomata (20)Cu Sith (14)Cait Sith (11)Night (N-N)Nyx (51)Vampire (45)Succubus (32)Incubus (27)Lilim (22)Nightmare (19)Empusa (15)Alp (10)Cyak (5)Jirae (N-N)Muspell (53)Titan (41)Ubelluris (35)Tsuchigumo (27)Dwarf (18)Buccaboo (15)Sudama (11)Kobold (6)Knocker (4)Fairy (N-N)Titania (54)Oberon (48)Cu Chulainn (43)Troll (38)Kelpie (29)Banshee (23)Elf (16)Pyro Jack (13)Jack Frost (12)Goblin (8)Pixie (3)Willy (2)Fallen (N-C)Samael (61)Agares (55)Gaap (49)Berith (44)Decarabia (39)Forneus (35)Baphomet (30)Eligor (24)Buer (21)Caim (17)Gagyson (12)Ukobach (7)Brute (N-C)Yaksa (46)Shutendouji (40)Yaksini (33)Turdak (28)Hannya (24)Azumi (16)Bogle (13)Ihika (8)Femme (N-C)Rangda (59)Volvo (56)Dakini (45)Gorgon (40)Cailleach Beara (37)Arachne (33)Lamia (29)Yomotsu Shikome (21)Hag (15)Vile (D-L)Cthulhu (78)Pazuzu (62)Nyarlathotep (55)Tezcatlipoca (45)Mishaguji (44)Nalagiri (39)Raptor (D-L)Hresvelgr (47)Anzu (34)Gurr (25)Furiae (17)Fu Xi (8)ChonChon (5)Jaki (D-N)Hecatoncheir (64)Girimehkala (53)Ekimmu (46)Cyclops (37)Rakshasa (33)Ogre (25)Orc (9)Gremlin (5)Wilder (D-N)Behemoth (62)Manticore (51)Scylla (43)Black Widow (30)Gyuuki (27)Nue (20)Bicorn (14)Garm (11)Wood (D-N)Yggdrasil (35)Alraune (28)Mandrake (18)Fukuchuuka (?)

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Title screen.[CR]Shin Megami Tensei II is an RPG released for the Super Famicom by Atlus in 1994. Like its predecessor Shin Megami Tensei, Shin Megami Tensei II is notable for using a first-person perspective in and out of battle and for the darker themes that make up its plot in comparison to its contemporaries.[CR]It was also released on the PlayStation and Game Boy Advance in Japan. It also saw several Japan-only rereleases for iOS and both the Wii's and Wii U's Virtual Console.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]Cutscene.[CR]Following the first game, the sequel presumes a world where the original game's protagonist took a Neutral alignment and founded a Utopian society whose citizens were free to follow whatever beliefs they chose. Peace lasted for about forty years before a Lawful sect called the Messians seized power and went to war against the Chaos-loving Gaeans. Shortly after, the world was reduced to a barely-habitable post-apocalyptic nightmare. The new protagonist is from one of the few habitable areas left in Japan, called Valhalla, which is part of a larger Messian-controlled community called Tokyo Millennium. When players meet him, he is a struggling gladiator nicknamed Hawk who is suffering from amnesia. Much of the early game's story line is about the slow revelation of Hawk's true memories and identity.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Battle.[CR]Similar to SMT's protagonist, Hawk receives the ability to communicate and summon demons in almost the same way, through a computer demon summoning computer called the COMP. The alignment system basically functions like in the first game, but will cause more dramatic variations in the storyline and have a deeper effect on gameplay. The combat system is expanded to include a wider variety of demons and the ability to fuse both demons and weapons together. There's also a more forgiving level of difficulty compared to the first game.[CR]Demon Compendium[CR]Demons are listed by race and level, from highest to lowest. Alignments are listed in parentheses: (Light/Neutral/Dark) - (Law/Neutral/Chaos). Bosses are listed by order of appearance, with their races noted in parentheses.Herald (L-L)99 Satan68 Metatron59 Camael59 Sariel52 Kushiel47 Ophanim40 Raguel37 Haniel32 Zaphkiel28 RemielAmatsu (L-L)59 Amaterasu54 Tsukuyomi48 Take-Mikazuchi44 Kagutsuchi38 Omoikane33 Tajikarao29 Ame no TorifuneAvian (L-L)49 Garuda41 Zhu Que31 Yatagarasu22 Phoenix15 SuparnaMegami (L-N)52 Lakshmi45 Parvati39 Freya35 Sarasvati27 Arianrhod21 Ame no UzumeDeity (L-N)67 Ardha64 Vairocana61 Kalki58 Baal55 Atavaka48 Odin40 Attar37 Horus34 Thor27 IndraAvatar (L-N)51 Barong45 Xuan Wu41 Anubis35 Narasimha29 Sphinx25 NandiHoly (L-N)42 Baihu32 Pabilsag28 Bastet20 Apis16 Unicorn12 HeqetPrime (L-N)32 Salamander30 Undine28 Sylph26 Gnome12 Flaemis11 Aquans10 Aeros9 ErthysFury (L-C)72 Shiva61 Susanoo48 Wu Kong39 Chernobog30 AresDragon (L-C)59 Ananta54 Rahab50 Itzamna43 Qing Long39 Quetzalcoatl36 Baek Yong34 MayaLady (L-C)65 Kali56 Ishtar47 Durga38 Kikuri-Hime33 Hariti26 TawaretKunitsu (L-C)57 Arahabaki53 Take-Minakata50 Onamuchi46 Kotoshironushi43 Sarutahiko35 Hitokotonushi30 Sukunahikona27 OyamatsumiDivine (N-L)52 Dominion44 Virtue36 Power32 Principality28 Archangel21 AngelFlight (N-L)38 Morrigan35 Macha31 Nemhain25 Aello21 Celaeno16 Ocypete9 BennuMesian (N-L)51 Adept40 Terminator34 Zelator26 Temple Knight21 Executor15 Neophyte9 ButcherSnake (N-N)53 Yamata no Orochi48 Vritra42 Naga Raja36 Otohime33 Mizuchi28 Naga19 NozuchiYoma (N-N)46 Hanuman43 Ganesha37 Jinn31 Tengu27 Heyoka14 MercuriusBeast (N-N)43 Cerberus39 Gdon30 Selket26 Orthrus20 Nekomata14 Cu Sith12 Cait SithNight (N-N)47 Nyx35 Vampire23 Lilim15 Nightmare12 Empusa8 AlpJirae (N-N)44 Titan34 Ubelluris27 Tsuchigumo18 Duergar11 Sudama6 KnockerFairy (N-N)48 Titania45 Oberon40 Cu Chulainn30 Nadja25 Banshee18 Dark Elf13 Pyro Jack12 Jack Frost7 High PixieDemonoid (N-N)16 Frankie11 Demi-Nandi7 Heracles6 Slave3 Oracle2 SpartanFallen (N-C)57 Agares49 Gaap41 Berith37 Baphomet29 Eligor24 Betelgeuse15 Gagyson10 UkobachBrute (N-C)46 Yaksa40 Shuten-douji33 Yaksini28 Turdak19 Hannya13 Azumi7 IhikaFemme (N-C)55 Rangda50 Volvo45 Gorgon38 Cailleach Bheur29 Arachne24 Lamia14 HagGaian (N-C)39 Kamen Hijiri30 Ashura22 Onmyouji15 Jiraiya8 KugutsuchiVile (D-L)67 Cthulhu59 Pazuzu53 Nyarlathotep47 Tezcatlipoca41 NalagiriRaptor (D-L)48 Hresvelgr38 Anzu26 Gurr17 Furiae4 ChonchonMech (D-L)37 Medusa30 Rabbi26 Golem21 Junk8 Iron Maiden5 Crazy DummyVaccine (D-L)15 Police10 JawsJaki (D-N)59 Hecatoncheir54 Girimehkala48 Edimmu40 Cyclops30 Rakshasa22 Ogre11 Wendigo[CR]6 GremlinWilder (D-N)60 Behemoth50 Manticore45 Scylla31 Black Widow29 Gyuuki20 Nue15 Bicorn10 GarmWood (D-N)38 Yggdrasil29 Alraune18 Mandrake7 AudreyDead (D-N)23 Corpse19 Zombie Priest15 Workaholic12 Bodyconian5 Zombie1 Zombie DogTyrant (D-C)99 Lucifer65 Beelzebub62 Mara55 Bael52 Astaroth49 Loki42 HecateDrake (D-C)51 Tiamat46 Kingu43 Nidhogg35 Tarasque28 Wyvern16 WormHaunt (D-C)44 Vetala32 Yaka25 Man Eater16 Ghulah14 Ghoul3 PretaSpirit (D-C)38 Legion29 Inferno15 Depths13 Hanged Man2 PoltergeistFoul (D-C)49 Old One39 Doppelganger28 Black Ooze17 Chris the Car9 Jack Ripper6 SlimeVirus (D-C)20 Andromeda8 Spider3 MoebiusBoss 110 (Warrior) Red Bear18 (Yoma) Mercurius20 (Drake) Basilisk22 (Tyrant) King Frost12 (Demonoid) Demi-Nandi24 (Fallen) Betelgeuse20 (Warrior) Daleth22 (Yoma) Janus25 (Warrior) Zayin23 (Warrior) DalethBoss 237 (Fallen) Baphomet43 (Kunitsu) Sarutahiko26 (Warrior) Daleth50 (Tyrant) Belphegor53 (Warrior) Gimmel48 (Herald) Uriel50 (Herald) Raphael54 (Herald) Michael69 (Holy Spirit) YHVH Image42 (Tyrant) Hecate62 (Deity) Atavaka54 (Yoma) Master Therion58 (Tyrant) Abaddon52 (Tyrant) AstarothBoss 338 (Divine General) Kumbhira38 (Divine General) Vajra37 (Divine General) Mihira37 (Divine General) Andira36 (Divine General) Anila36 (Divine General) Sandilya35 (Divine General) Indara35 (Divine General) Pajra34 (Divine General) Mahoraga34 (Divine General) Kinnara40 (Divine General) Catura40 (Divine General) VikaralaBoss 450 (Drake) Tiamat70 (Deity) Vairocana69 (Tyrant) Mara30 (Tyrant) Lucifuge80 (Tyrant) Beelzebub100 (Tyrant) Lucifer80 (Drake) Kuzuryu77 (Holy Spirit) Sabaoth85 (Holy Spirit) Shaddai93 (Holy Spirit) Elohim100 (Holy Spirit) Satan108 (Holy Spirit) YHVHFiend35 Alice30 Ghost Q50 Sage of Time35 Hell Biker40 MatadorStory DemonsGabrielGemoriMasakadoSethCherubPop Culture References[CR]While the Shin Megami Tensei series' demon rosters are almost always exclusively populated by gods and entities of religion and folklore, a few of Shin Megami Tensei II's demons are culled from pop culture works that were popular prior to the game's creation.Betelgeuse: The bio-exorcist title character of the homophonic 1988 Tim Burton film, played by actor Michael Keaton. In Shin Megami Tensei II, he has a polka-dotted suit instead of the pinstripe one he wears in the film, and wears a bat mask and bat necklace in reference to Keaton's subsequent role as Batman in the eponymous 1989 box office hit. Betelgeuse also appears as a boss early on in the game, in a large, dragon-like form roughly reminiscent of his snake transformation seen in the movie.Audrey: The carnivorous talking plant of 1960's Little Shop of Horrors and its 1986 remake.Chris the Car: A take on Christine, the sentient car from Stephen King's 1983 novel and subsequent film.Ghost Q: An adaptation of Q-taro, a mischievous ghost from a Japanese manga and anime series called Obake no Q-taro.Messian Terminator: The design of the "Messian Terminator" is based on the appearance of the T-800 model appearing in the 1984 release of The Terminator.[CR]Shin Megami Tensei II also marks the first appearance of Hell Biker, who is unmistakably similar to the Marvel comics character Ghost Rider.English Translation[CR]Like with the first Shin Megami Tensei, there is a translation patch available on Aeon Genesis. It was made available on May 13th 2004.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Entering the hidden dungeon, Kongokai[CR]In the hidden dungeon, you can find the most powerful weapons in the game. You need to beat the game once and you must have a file saved before the final dungeon. From there, teleport  to Shinjuku and head out to the world map. Once you are at the world map, head east and go to the NPC that's standing at the cliff side. He'll ask you whether or not you can go to Kongokai.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shin Momotarou Densetsu ("New Momotaro Legend") is a traditional RPG for the Super Famicom featuring Momotaro, the famous "peach boy" of Japanese folklore. The game's story continues where the previous game, 1990's Momotarou Densetsu II for the PC Engine, leaves off. Momotaro returns home to his adoptive parents while the demons he's foiled previously continue to plot against him.[CR]Shin Momotarou Densetsu would be the last Momotarou Densetsu game until a GBC compilation in 2001.[CR]					</plot>

			<plot>Well, what can I say about this game? Well, for starters, it's the sequel to classic(!?) NES game, Renegade. Now, before you start running, let me say that it's waaaaaaaaaay cooler. For starters, the plot line is a lot more involved, there's no doors that take you back to the beginning of the game, and there's profanities all over the place. Yeah, I thought that would get your attention.[CR]The game is kind of like West Side Story (or Deuce's Wild for the uncultured) meets Double Dragon.You play through the game as the "protectors" of two Japanese High Schools  Riki and Kunio (and eventually two other folks), and they've been thrown in jail for something they haven't done. Naturally, you have to break out of your cell, and you of course do this by beating the piss out of everyone that isn't you. You spend the rest of the game beating the answers to why you've been framed out of all the hoodlums you encounter. Add a motorcycle chase towards the end into the equation, and that's the gist of the game.[CR]The game play is straight-forward (it has nothing that hasn't been done before in the first Double Dragon game), but it's still fun nonetheless.[CR]Translation Description:[CR]What's to say? This is the work of Gideon, and it should go without saying that everything is translated with no errors or glitches that I encountered. The language of the script is a little coarse, but given that it's a Kunio game, it's probably coarse in the Japanese version as well. Anyhow, another job well-done by Gideon.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Password Cracks[CR]The passwords in Kunio Tachi no Banka consist of Four digits. The first and third digits is the game's stage.  Here's the a list of all the passwords for each level. The second digit is used for the Bike Stages. In order to go to a Bike Stage, the first and third digit must be 0s, while the second digit must be one of the following numbers. The fourth and final digit is to determine the difficulty level. Even Numbers are for Normal Mode (0, 2, 4, 6, 8), while Odd Numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) are for Easy Mode. This is quite meaningless if you try to go to any scene beyond the first conversation with Sabu, as the game will always be in Normal.[CR]1X0X 00-Reset[CR]2X0X 01-Beginning of the game[CR]3X0X 02-Entrance to Cell[CR]4X0X 03-Vs.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling '94: Battlefield in Tokyo Dome is a 1994 New Japan Pro Wrestling game for the Super Famicom and PC Engine CD-ROM. It features multiple wrestlers active on the NJPW roster at the time, including both native and foreign talent. Like its predecessor Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling: Chou Senshi in Tokyo Dome (and its successor, Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling '95: Tokyo Dome Battle 7), the ring is depicted from a side view as wrestlers walk in from the two sides to start each bout.[CR]The player can select between the Battlefield in Tokyo Dome event, the G1 Climax event (both of which are major annual events for the promotion), an IGWP Heavyweight Championship bout (a belt considered the highest accolade within NJPW) and a standalone versus battle. The Battlefield and Versus modes also allow for tag teams and multiple players.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Shinri Game: Akuma no Kokoroji is a quiz based on judging the player's psychological profile. Various questions pose scenarios that the player weighs in on, and the game attempts to interpret the answers to psychoanalyze the player.[CR]The Shinri Game series is published by Visit, which would go on to take a developer role for future entries in the series. Akuma no Kokoroji in particular was developed by Ukiyotei, a short-lived company started by an ex-Capcom employee which also created Skyblazer among other SNES games.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shinseiki Odysselya ("Holy Chronicles of the Gods: Odysselya") is a fantasy RPG from Vic Tokai. It is a traditional turn-based RPG, with the first-person combat view made popular by Dragon Quest and the earlier RPGs like Wizardry that inspired it. The protagonist is an amnesiac human woman (who the player names early on) that is rescued by a friendly dragonman during the game's intro.[CR]The game was followed by a sequel, Shinseiki Odysselya 2, in 1995. Shinseiki Odysselya was intended to be released in the US with the name Lost Mission, but the localization project was canceled close to completion.</plot>

			<title_clean>Shodai Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun</title_clean>
			<plot>First next-gen entry in the Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun brawler series. The story this time deals with the Nekketsu High gang making a field trip to Osaka. However rebel student Kunio and his pal Riki do a little more than sightseeing and get tangled up with the local Yakuzas so now its a battle for survival if they want to get out of the city alive.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B]-wise the game follows the already familiar beat 'em up/RPG hybrid template for the series, in which you control your character as he battles his way through side scrolling levels with a collection of attacks and special moves. These special moves can be acquired by collecting special items and your character gains experience for defeating enemies which allows you to upgrade his stats when leveling up. The battles are somewhat more chaotic as they are now staged as distinct waves that must be cleared before you can continue to scroll down the level, in each of these waves you'll face not only opposing gang members, but also neutral characters, policemen and other assorted NPCs that can fight on your side, against you, or simply ignore you depending on your behavior.[CR]New features in Shodai-NKKK include branching plot-points that lead you to different challenges and even alternate endings as well as completely reworked graphics to take advantage of the 16-bit SNES which now feature a more realistically proportioned character design.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shodan Morita Shogi ("Morita's First-Rank Shogi") is a shogi game that is intended for advanced players. Shodan, or beginner/first rank, is the first level of mastery (or "dan") at the game which an advanced player reaches once they pass through the student (or "kyu") ranks. Kazuro Morita is credited as the developer of the shogi software, and so the game is named after him. His name was previously attached to a NES shogi game from the same developers named simply Morita Shogi.[CR]Because Shodan Morita Shogi is meant to be a serious shogi simulator, it doesn't have the anime portraits or colorful presentation of some of its intro-level-friendly peers. Like almost all shogi games, it was never released outside of Japan.</plot>

The player alternates between controlling the human Ashibe, as he escorts his friends across a world map while talking to NPCs and following the game's story, and the seal Goma-chan in 2D platformer stages where he must track down eight items by investigating his surroundings thoroughly. While Goma-chan can't be hurt by enemies, colliding with them causes him to lose one of the eight items he's already found - as the stages have a strict time limit, it's best to avoid this situation whenever possible.[CR]Shounen Ashibe was originally a Shounen Jump serialized manga before becoming an anime TV series in 1991, a year before this game was released.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Passwords[CR]At the title screen choose the second selection and enter the following chain.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shounen Ninja Sasuke ("Boy Ninja Sasuke") is a comedic brawler published by SunSoft exclusively for the Super Famicom. The player, as the eponymous ninja, must rescue the daughter of a local lord by fighting his way through hordes of masked bandits led by a mysterious warlord. A second player can join in as Sasuke's monk friend Chin-nan. [CR]The game has a distinct sense of speed and verticality, and it's recommended that the player(s) try running and jumping around performing aerial attacks rather than staying on the ground and getting quickly swarmed by enemies.[CR]The game was published by SunSoft and developed by an unknown developer, though Mint is thought to have contributed to its sound design. A US SNES localization, with the title Boy Ninja Sasuke, was briefly considered but then axed.[CR]	</plot>

			<title_clean>Shuushoku Game</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shuushoku Game (or SG: Trendy Drama) is a Japan-exclusive video game based around the Japanese sub-culture of Japanese drama, "Trendy Drama" (hence the name), which is a form of drama typically targeting young children and young adults and is based around normal human issues such as love, family problems, and other social issues.[CR]To find a game that takes it as literally as this game does is harder to come by than one might think. Shuushoku Game is specifically based around the Trendy Drama sub-culture during the shift in its popularity from the mid eighties to early nineties when Japan was experiencing a "bubble economy".[CR]In this game, you are part of a young team of white-collar Japanese workers and entrepreneurs in training who act as your friends, rivals, and love interests, the main of which are in their early-to-mid twenties. The game ranges from doing everyday things such as hanging out with friends and grabbing drinks at the local bar to traveling to other cities, meeting bigwig business men with whom you must make business proposals, and monitoring the business giants and making important business decisions to remain competitive. Despite the sound of it, the game isn't overly complex (and the ability to save between most events makes things easier).[CR]Shuushoku Game will appeal to those into the whole "Trendy Drama", soap opera business.</plot>

			<title_clean>Silva Saga II - The Legend of Light and Darkness</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Silva Saga II: The Legend of Light and Darkness is a turn-based RPG from SETA Corporation and the sequel to their Famicom RPG Silva Saga, which in turn was a sequel to their earlier Minelvaton Saga also for Famicom. The three games constitute a trilogy set in the same world (Minelvaton), and each successive game has allowed the player to revisit the same locations. Silva Saga II starts just before Silva Saga concluded, following the adventures of an amnesiac swordsman who sets out to rescue the first game's protagonist Kyral from the villainous Zolde.[CR]Silva Saga II plays similarly to the Dragon Quest games, putting large enemy sprites front and center in its turn-based combat. A difference is the game's party feature: The player can have up to three parties with him at any given time, one filled with story characters, one with NPC mercenaries who lack magic but are very strong and idol deities which lack strength and HP but have powerful magic. Neither of the latter two parties are under the player's control, though switching out the party at critical intervals can greatly assist with some of the game's tougher battles.[CR]The game was never released outside of Japan nor officially localized into English, though there is a fan translation from group Dynamic-Designs.[CR]	</plot>

			<title_clean>SimAnt</title_clean>
			<plot>The game is essentially a simulation of an ant colony. The game consists of three modes: a Quick Game, a Full Game, and an Experimental Game. It was released for the IBM PC, Commodore Amiga, Apple Macintosh, and Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The Nintendo version also added eight scenarios, where the goal in each is to eliminate the enemy red ants in various locales, each with different hazards.[CR]In SimAnt, the player plays the role of an ant in a colony of black ants in the back yard of a suburban home. The ant colony must battle against enemy red ants. The ultimate goal is to spread throughout the garden, into the house, and finally to drive out the antlions, spiders and human owners. In this respect, SimAnt differed from other 'Sim' games that were open-ended and had no victory conditions.[CR]In the Quick Game, the player establishes a black ant colony in a small patch of yard, shown in top-down perspective. The computer opponent establishes a competing red ant colony in the same patch. Underground ant colonies are depicted in a side view. The player has direct control of a single ant at a time, indicated by a yellow color, and may switch control to a different ant at any time (by double-clicking the desired ant). (A little known fact is that the spider in the game can also be controlled by double clicking it.) The player's yellow ant may influence the behavior of other black ants by leaving pheromone trails to destinations such as food and enemy ant colonies and can control the other ants in a limited way (by ordering a certain number to follow it, for instance). The quick game is won or lost when either the red or black colony in said patch is defeated.[CR]The player's yellow ant may pick up food and pebbles, engage in trophallaxis (by receiving regurgitated food from friendly ants), and attack enemy ants. Groups of ants (or yellow ant with his recruits) may attack and kill bigger enemies like spiders, caterpillars, and antlions. Natural hazards include human footsteps, electrical outlets, bugspray, spiders, antlions, lawnmowers, and rain, which washes away pheromone trails and can flood the bottom of ant nests.[CR]In the Full Game, the player begins with an ant colony in an overhead view, much like the Quick Game. The region of this overhead view is a single square of a map containing a yard and house. The player spreads to other areas by producing young queens and drones to mate with each other. The full game is lost when the black colonies are eliminated and won when the red colonies are eliminated and the humans are driven out of the house.[CR]The Experimental Game is similar to the Quick Game, except the player can also control red ants and has access to a set of experimental tools. These tools allow the player to place pheromone trails, maze walls, rocks, ants, pesticides and food.[CR]The boxed game also comes with a thoroughly researched instruction manual, which not only covers game mechanics, but also contains a large amount of information regarding ants and ant societies.[CR][B]Tips:[/B][CR]Shortcut to Red Ant Nest[CR]This is a glitch that allows you to easily get to the red ant nest. When you have about 50 ants, dig all the way to the bottom, then dig all the way left and all the way right. If the conditions are right a hole should appear and if you go through it you will be transported to the red ant nest. Unfortunately, you can't bring other ants with you. This glitch could be used to get some food or eggs and easily kill the queen without going through the chaos above ground.[CR]WARNING: When it rains and if you're outside the hole will disappear.[CR]Access all Scenarios.[CR]Plug an SNES mouse into controller port 2 and click on the scenarios to light them up, then use controller 1 to select them.[CR]Convert to Queen[CR]Enter the house and move between the television and the chair.  Use the electric socket closest to the colony to shock yourself.  The word 'Change' will appear to confirm correct trick entry. You will reappear in the colony as the[CR]Queen.[CR]Turn to Queen Ant[CR]Simply die when you are the last ant left. You SHOULD be reborn as the Queen[CR]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimAnt[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Debug Menu[CR]Plug a SNES Mouse into controller port 2, then while holding both mouse buttons, press L+R+Start on Controller 1 at the title screen.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Shortcut to Red Ant Nest[CR]This is a glitch that allows you to easliy get to the red ant nest.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]SimCity 2000 is the second game in the SimCity franchise, first released in 1993 for Mac and DOS. A Windows playable version, SimCity 2000 Special Edition, was released in 1995. SimCity 2000 was also ported to many consoles, ranging from the SNES to the GBA, and is also available on PSN.What a city![CR]SimCity 2000 adds many features that were missing from the original. With new tools in transportation, zoning, and infrastructure, as well as a isometric view and a smoother UI, SimCity 2000 gives players more freedom than the original SimCity to create cities. With no real goal, the game instead directs players by consequence, being given a set of tools and set loose on a dynamic play area. Given enough money, the player can use the tools in any way they want, but if their cities are not generating income, the money will soon run dry. Players will find that to function, cities need utilities, civic services, transport infrastructure, and a fragile balance between homes and jobs. Playing within (and sometimes outside) the limits of the rules and seeing what works is part of the game.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]In SimCity 2000, the player starts off with a randomly generated piece of land, which could be terraformed to their liking. The player then builds a city, providing it with necessary utilities and civic structures. They also need to balance their budget, their income coming from rent and taxes, and their expenditure from building and maintaining the city. If they run below a certain budget deficit, they will be kicked out of the mayor's office, losing the game.Undeveloped Zones[CR]There are 3 main types of buildings in SimCity 2000: Residential, Commercial, and Industrial (RCI). They are not built by the player directly. Instead, the player "zones" certain plots of land for specific development. Zones are the main type development in any city in the SimCity franchise, and what grows in those zones are determined by the amounts of utilities and services that plot can receive, and the land value of the area. Players can also zone landfills, air and seaports, and military bases. These zones are not as affected by land value as RCI zones but they will drastically affect their surrounding areas negatively.[CR]Land value is an important factor in SimCity 2000, and can be raised or lowered by the presence or absence of water features, trees, and pollution. It can also be affected presence or absence of civic structures, power and water supply, and good transport infrastructure. Rewards, special buildings given to the player for reaching certain population milestones, also help to boost land value of the area.Arcologies[CR]Arcologies are special futuristic buildings, rewarded to players once they reach a city population of 120,000 and they are after the year that they are invented. There are 4 arcologies in SimCity 2000: Plymouth Arco, Forest Arco, Darco, and the Launch Arco. Arcologies provide the city with a huge boost in population, the smallest one (Forest Arco) providing 30,000 residents, and the mighty Launch Arco giving a massive 60,000 residents.[CR]Launch Arcos also have a special effect. After building 300 Launch Arcos, a special message "The exodus has begun." will appear, and the they will "launch" (in reality, just explode). The player will then be compensated for the construction costs after all the Launch Arcos have been launched. This only occurs in the PC and Mac versions of the game.Disasters[CR]Disasters will hamper a player's construction of their cities (unless they turned it off). These disasters are random, and range from mundane (a fire), to the extreme (monster invasions). Players can also activate these disasters purposely to destroy their cities for fun. There are 8 disasters in the game:Fire: An inferno blazes through the city. Fire stations help put it out.Flood: Waters flood into the city. Dispatch emergency services to limit floods.Air Crash: A plane crashes into the city and starts fires.Tornado: A rampaging tornado rips up trees and buildings.Earthquake: An earthquake destroys both buildings and underground infrastructure.Monster: A giant sphere with an huge eye descends on the city, and sets things on fire with its laser beams.Hurricane: A hurricane destroys buildings and cause flooding.Rioters: Unhappy Sims protest on the streets and start fires. Police presence helps to limit rioting.Scenarios[CR]SimCity 2000 comes with 6 scenarios, where the player can take over an existing city (either fictional or based on a real city) and try to solve its problems. They are: Charleston, Dullsville, Flint, Hollywood, Oakland Hills, and Davenport. An additional scenario pack was also released for the game, Scenarios Vol 1: Great Disasters. As the name suggests, players have to battle disasters in 12 new cities: Atlanta, Barcelona, Chicago, Davenport, Homestead, Malibu, Manhattan, Oakland, Portland, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, and Washington D.C.[CR]SimCity Urban Renewal Kit[CR]The SimCity Urban Renewal Kit (SCURK) is a toolset that players can use to create and modify buildings for SimCity 2000. It first shipped with the Scenarios Vol 1: Great Disasters expansion but then made its way to the SimCity 2000 Special Edition released in 1995. SCURK is divided into 3 parts: "Paint the Town", a bitmap editor to create and edit buildings, "Pick and Copy", a tileset creator, and "Place and Print", basically a sandbox version of the original game. SCURK created a vibrant mod community with SimCity 2000, and some fan designs made it to SimCity 3000.[CR]System Requirements[CR]PC System Requirements (GOG Version)OS: Windows XP/Windows VistaProcessor: 1.8 GHz Processor or equivalentMemory: 512MB RAM (1 GB recommended)Video: 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (compatible with DirectX 9 recommended)HDD: 2GB of free hard drive space[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Start with $1,000,000[CR]Select Land of Freedom and enter your name. Then enter your city name as New York. You now have 1,000,000 dollars!</plot>

			<plot>"Slayers" is based on an manga series of the same name (also known as Lina the Teenage Sorceress). The heroine of the manga (and of the game) is Lina Inverse, a seventeen-year-old girl who can use magic and is also proficient with the sword. Lina particularly likes money, and often robs rich people and hunts for treasure. She also has a sense for justice - if a village or a town is in trouble, Lina will do anything to protect it and to fight the bad guys! In the game, Lina is knocked down after a fight against mysterious attackers, and is found by the inhabitants of the nearby village. The trouble is, she can't remember anything! When she meets her long-time companion Naga, their first objective become to investigate the goblin attacks on the population, but Lina's ultimate quest is to regain her memory and to find out who or what has attacked her.[CR]The game is a traditional console-style RPG with towns, dungeons, random enemies, and turn-based combat viewed from first-person perspective, in a Dragon Warrior fashion. The characters can attack physically or use special attacks. Lina can also cast various magical spells. You cannot travel on the world map, but "jump" to various locations instead. The game features anim-style cut scenes.</plot>

			<title_clean>Smash T.V.</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Smash TV is Eugene Jarvis' spiritual successor to Robotron: 2084, an early arcade game that is one of the first examples of the twin stick control method. Smash TV retains this same gameplay, using the left joystick to move and the right to shoot, allowing a player to move in one direction while firing in another.The year is 1999. A new game show called Smash TV was created which puts its contenders to the fight for their lives. They will have to kill hundreds of enemies and collect money and prizes (from toasters to a big-screen TV). The inspiration for Smash TV seems to be the Arnold Schwarzenegger film, The Running Man. Two players can play simultaneously, and at the end of each of the three levels, the two players' performance is compared, with one being declared the winner.Evil M.C.Each level ends with a boss battle. The first level pits the players against Mutoid Man. The second boss is a giant, round face named Scarface. The third level seemingly ends with a fight against two large, robotic snake heads called Die Cobros. But this is immediately followed by the game's true boss, the game show host himself called Evil M.C. This battle is essentially a tougher version of the Mutoid Man boss fight.[CR]Home Versions[CR]Super Smash TV for the SNES  After its success in coin-operated form, Smash TV was brought to the home market on many different console and computer platforms. Home game consoles of the era were not equipped with multi-joystick controllers; alternative control schemes were implemented to approximate the controls of the arcade original. While some versions use buttons to fire in a direction, or to toggle a direction, others use multiple controllers' joysticks. Acclaim's SNES version of the game, Super Smash TV (referred to by its original name within the game), used the D pad and face buttons to duplicate the two joysticks of the original. The SNES version also contains additional secret rooms.The Xbox Live Arcade version of the game, which is an emulation of the original arcade release, controls with its two joysticks. It is also the only version to include online play, letting two players play the game over the Internet.This game is featured on Midway Arcade Treasures for the Gamecube, Playstation 2, Xbox, and PC.[CR][B]Achievements:[/B][CR]Due to a glitch in the xbox live arcade version of the game, 360 users are unable to obtain the full 200 achievement points available in the game. The Game Master Achievement (in theory obtained by beating the game without continuing on default systems) does not unlock, denying gamers the game's final 50 points. The publishers have acknowledged the problem, but there are currently no plans to fix the issue.[CR][B]Sequels:[/B][CR]Though Smash TV never received a proper sequel, many of the same people responsible for the game went on to produce Total Carnage, a game that maintained the same control style and applied it to a vertical scrolling world, similar to Ikari Warriors or Mercs. There are plenty of references to Smash TV in Total Carnage.[CR]	</plot>

			<plot>A puzzle spin-off title from the Ganbare Goemon series. Goemon has been captured and his friend Ebisumaru goes out to try to find and rescue him. In order to do so, he must traverse a series of maze-like levels avoiding obstacles and enemies and get to the end zone.[CR]The game is played from an isometric perspective from which you can get a good view of the mazes and Ebisumaru. You have no direct control of Ebisumaru per se, but instead switch special blocks around the mazes that can change Ebisumaru's direction of travel and such. You must reach the end of each stage before time runs out, and get all the power-ups and items laid in each maze in hopes of getting to Goemon alive.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sotsugyou Bangai Hen: Nee Mahjong Shiyo! ("Graduation Extra-Story: Hey, Mahjong Present!") is a mahjong game for the Super Famicom. It features a cast of highschool seniors from an all-girls school and their male homeroom teacher, who decide to play mahjong against each other. Despite the format, the game is not ecchi (adult) in nature.[CR]The game is based on the Graduation (Sotsugyou) series of school simulation games. Many of those games featured the same cast, and the player (as their teacher) had to mold them into model students by tutoring them on their weak subjects. This game is designated as "bangai hen", which means "extra story" or "bonus story" - a game not part of the core series, but related.</plot>

			<title_clean>Space Invaders - The Original Game</title_clean>
			<plot>Taito and Nintendo have brought back the classic Space Invaders game, with very little modification. An incredibly popular game when it was first released, Space Invaders has inspired many reproductions over the years, although this type of game has been eclipsed by modern graphics-heavy, music-laden games.[CR]In any case, the subtitle, "The Original Game," is pretty much the truth. The graphics are almost identical to the original Atari release. There is almost no animation, things just move back and forth on the screen. There is no background music, also true to the original, but the original sound effects are there, and still amazingly good for such a simple game.[CR]The main difference is that this new edition has a competitive two-player mode. Not only can you take turns and compete for points, but you can face-off in a side-by-side split screen contest, in the tradition of Tetris and Dr. Mario.[CR]If you like a game of survival and high scores, and if you like direct competition outside of the fighting game genre, then give Space Invaders a try. You'll love it![CR]http://www.consoleclassix.com/snes/space_invaders.html</plot>

			<title_clean>Star Ocean</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Star Ocean is an action RPG for the Super Famicom and was the first game developed by tri-Ace. The game was published by Enix on July 19, 1996 and was never released outside of Japan. A enhanced remake named Star Ocean: First Departure was released for the PSP in 2007.[CR]Star Ocean was created by the team behind Tales of Phantasia by Namco and features many similarities to it. The team left Namco due to "creative differences," such as the alteration of the character names, story, sprites, and even the title of the game itself (the original being Tale Phantasia, named after the novel by Yoshiharu Gotanda, the game's main programmer).[CR]An unofficial English patch was created by DeJap Translations for Star Ocean and was released on December 31, 2003.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Star Ocean begins in Clatos, a town on the undeveloped planet of Roak, and follows a young Fellpool named Ratix Farrence. He is a swordsman in the Clatos Brigade, as is his companion Dorn Marto, who's duty is to defend the town against thieves and robbers. One day, a petrifying disease spreads in the northern town of Cool, turning it's inhabitants to stone. The town healer, who is the father of Ratix's best friend, Milly Kiliet, travels to Cool and tries to use his Crest Magic (also known as Heraldry and Symbology in later games) to cure the disease. Hr is unable to, and is eventually turned to stone himself. When this news returns to the village of Clatos, Ratix, Dorn, and Milly set off to collect Metox, a herb said to cure any ailment, from Mt. Metox.[CR]When they reach the top, where the plant is said to grow, they are met by a mysterious light, from which two oddly dressed people emerge from. One is a male named Ronixis J. Kenny, and the other a blonde female named Iria Silvestoli. Ronixis introduces himself as a captain of the Earth Federation starship Calnus. He tells them that the disease that is turning their people to stone was caused by the Resonia, a race the Federation is at war with. He doesn't know why they are targeting their planet though.[CR]It turns out that the Resonia are using Roakian blood to block out the part of the spectrum that is visible to the human eye. While this would give them a massive advantage in the war against the Federation, they use it to sneak into Federation HQ and explain that they do not wish to fight, but are being forced by the Fargett, a race that hates the Federation.[CR]The group also discovers that the petrifying disease is caused by a monster known as Asmodeus, who originates on the planet Roak. Ronixis decides to travel to Planet Stream (later called Planet Styx), and use the Time Gate located there to travel back in time and gain a sample of Asmodeus' blood. After gaining the sample, they head back to their own time, but get separated from each other, Ronixis and Milly on one continent, while Ratix and Iria are on another.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Invincible characters[CR]This glitch allows you to make your entire party (except for Ratix) invincible.  It works by reducing them to 0 HP outside of battle but not actually killing them.  As a result, the game will treat them as still being alive, but not apply the effects of any damage to them.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Invincible characters[CR]Requirements:[CR]One character with either "Rhythmic sense" or "Pitch Sense", but not both, and any music level (higher is faster).[CR]One character with neither of those talents, and level 1 in music[CR]Either Guitar song or either Trombone song, and the appropriate instrument.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Invincible characters[CR]Step 1: Decrease everyone's HP to 1.  Best way to do this is to use a Guitar song (preferably 2) or a Trombone song (preferably 2) with the first character.  You should hear a chirping in the background, and your HP will decrease.  Continue doing this until everyone's HP is at 1 (Ratix does not have to be at 1 HP).  [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Invincible characters[CR]Step 2: Heal Ratix (or at least one character) so that he does not go to 0 HP in the next step.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Invincible characters[CR]Step 3: Have the second character use either Guitar or Trombone song.  Everyone's 1 HP will go to zero, but the game will still have their walking sprites.  You can neither heal nor revive them now (although you can recover status ailments).[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Invincible characters[CR](This is the glitch)[CR]Step 4: Enter a fight.  The 0-HP characters will still be active and attack...and receive attacks, but the enemy attacks won't ever connect.  Milly and Joshua will neither heal nor revive the 0-HP characters.  Note that if all 4 characters in the battle reach 0 HP, it is still a game over.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Invincible characters[CR]After the fight, the 0-HP characters will still receive EXP, and they will recover HP and MP due to Stanima (so you have to reset the glitch).  But the important part is that they cannot be killed or even touched by any means.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Oracle Room[CR]After you have beaten the game, reload your saved game and have somebody use the Oracle specialtiy. You will be sent to a secret area. Each door takes you to a room where you can talk to members of the game's development staff. To exit, take the passage on the lower left or right corner. The lower right corner will take you to the Revorse Tower. The lower left corner will take you to Tatoroy.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Oracle Room[CR]After beating the final boss of the game, use the oracle skill, and go through the south-west door.[CR]You\'ll end up in the Tataroy arena. Now go one step up, to arrive in the Seven Star Ruin. This secret dungeon has 30 levels and no save points.[CR]It contains super hard enemies, and a even harder boss.[CR]At the bottom is some of the best items in the game.</plot>

			<title_clean>Sugoi Hebereke</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Sugoi Hebereke ("Amazing Hebereke") is a 1994 competitive multiplayer arena fighter and a spin-off of the usually more puzzle-focused Hebereke series. Hebereke and his friends take to a number of different arenas to brawl each other. Upon being defeated, the character turns into one of the "Popoons" of Hebereke's Popoon (a Puyo Puyo inspired puzzle game).[CR]Sugoi Hebereke was one of a few Hebereke games to never receive a European localization (Ufouria is the only game in the series to see a US release). SunSoft would take what they learned for future fighting/party games like Galaxy Fight: Universal Warriors or Astra Super Stars.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Each arena is depicted from a top-down perspective and has a mix of native obstacles and items that are carried into the arena by smaller "helper" characters. These items can make a character stronger, recover their health or even sabotage them.[CR]Sugoi Hebereke features Hebereke (penguin), Oh-Chan (girl in cat suit), Sukezaemon (ghost with shades), Jennifer (big-lipped frog), Boo (purple bird), Utsu (alien in cat suit), Pen (boy in penguin suit) and Unyo (alien wearing a helmet). Each has their own array of basic attacks.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Play as Clone Characters[CR]On the title screen, press: Up, Down, Right, Left, A, B, X, Y. If done correctly, a chime will ring, and a small "Edited!" icon will appear on screen. You can now have more than one of the same character being played in a match at a time. Additionally in this mode, when selecting a character, use A to swap into a pink palette, B for a yellow palette, X for a blue palette, or Y for a green palette for the cloned character.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Play as Clone Characters[CR]Hold both the A, Y, and L buttons while turning on the game to access the Sound Test menu.In this menu, use the B button to play the selected Voice sample, the X button to play selected Music track, and the A button to play the selected Sound effect.</plot>

			<plot>In February 1991, The United States of America sent troops into Kuwait and fought in armed combat against the forces of Iraq. Operation Desert Storm featured many different types of units including mobile armor. The M1 Abrams tank division is deployed in a variety of missions to destroy marked Iraqi targets.[CR]Super Battletank: War in the Gulf is a 1st person tank simulation. Players sit in the cockpit to of a M1 Abrams tank. Controls allow the player to accelerate forward, decelerate, rotate the tank's trajectory left and right, move the tank's cannon left and right, fire the weapon and check the map. The goal of the player is to travel to the location of enemy targets, line them up with the Abrams cannon and fire upon them until destroyed. Each mission covers a large area of land and the player will need to consult the real-time map to travel appropriately to target locations. The M1 Abrams tank also features 2 special weapons: The laser which is more powerful than regular cannon, and the smoke screen which allows the player to escape.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Move around Faster[CR]Instead of moving at the slow, normal pace, switch the screen to map mode, and drive your tank from there to get around alot faster.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Move around Faster[CR]Fire you machine guns at a target, and as the bullets are hitting the target, pause the game. If the object is red when you pause the game, the bullets will keep hitting the target and destroying it without costing you bullets, or your tank.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Bikkuriman is a fighter game from BEC (Interbec) and Tom Create, based on a popular collectible sticker franchise. Specifically, the game is based on the 44 episode 1992-93 anime adaptation with the same name, and features most of its cast of characters in the roster. The game includes two modes: a single-player elimination tournament against increasingly difficult computer opponents, and a versus mode for up to two players.[CR]In the single-player mode, the player can only choose from two characters: Phoenix and Tiki. The two characters fight almost identically. They fight through the other six characters from the versus mode and a "clone fight" against the character they did not select. Beating the game leads to the ending and a password (A, B, L, R, X, Y, Start) that allows players to select the same character as their opponent in versus mode.CharactersPhoenixTikiMaster Poseidon Dark HeraSaladdinLittle MinosDevil ZeusDavidas[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Play as the same character in versus mode[CR]To play as the same character in versus mode, on the title screen press A, B, L, R, X, and then Y.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Birdie Rush is a top-down golf game released exclusively in Japan and the sequel to Golf Club: Birdie Rush. Super Birdie Rush was either developed by Data East or commissioned by them, and they also published the game.[CR]The player can select between Stroke Play, Match Play and Tournament, each of which takes progressively more time to complete. The game takes advantage of Mode 7 when presenting an overhead view of each hole before the player can tee off. It otherwise takes the common video game golf route of having the player hit the button to stop a moving gauge in order to determine how much power is behind the swing.</plot>

			<title_clean>Super Bomber Man</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Bomberman was the first Bomberman game for the SNES. It was created by Hudson Soft in 1993 and has a single- and multi-player mode. The game, like previous titles, is viewed from top-down with the player moving around dropping bombs exploding soft blocks to collect power ups and to destroy the enemy (whether it is a player in multiplayer or monsters in single player mode).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Each area fills the screen and is enclosed, so the camera never has to move. The areas typically consist of permanent blocks and destructible blocks, in various colors and styles, with half a dozen standard enemies or a larger boss enemy. The player controls Bomberman, a small character in a white protective suit. He drops bombs at his feet, which pulse for a few seconds and then send flames vertically and horizontally a set number of squares/tiles. The flames destroy the destructible blocks and damage or kill enemies, but they also kill the Bomberman, making tactical placement of bombs very important, especially as bombs cannot be walked over once placed (unless the Bomb Walk power-up is picked up).Power-ups[CR]An important part of the game is making use of power-ups found after destroying walls or blocks in game. Most power-ups are lost on death in the single-player campaign. Examples are listed below.Extra bombs: Allows the player to have several bombs out at once (rather than waiting for each to explode). Allows for chain reactions.Extra range: Incrementally increases the distance the flames from where the bombs travel, potentially up to the whole width of the area.Maximum range: Gives the full flame range in one power-up.Super bombs: Allows the flame from bombs to pass through destructible blocks as it destroys them.Punch: Allows Bomberman to punch a placed bomb, sending it bouncing over walls into areas otherwise unreachable.Kick: Allows Bomberman to kick a placed bomb, sending it rolling in one direction until it hits a wall.Invincibility: Makes the player invulnerable. Allows a technique of continually dropping bombs into existing flame, creating a constant flame around the player as they walk.Remote bombs: Allows the player to place bombs and then press another button to detonate them, allowing for traps to be laid far easier.Rollerskates: Gives the player increased movement speed.Wall Walk: Allows Bomberman to freely walk over/through destructible blocks.Bomb Walk: Allows Bomberman to freely walk over/through bombs that have been placed - reduces chances of being trapped.Time increase: In Story Mode, increases the amount of time the players has to clear any given stage.Extra Life: In Story Mode, grants the player an additional life.[CR]There also exists in the game a 'skull' power-up, that has a negative effect when picked up. It essentially prevents the player from planting any bombs for a certain length of time. This is contagious - if the player's Bomberman is touched by an enemy Bomberman who has this effect, they will be affected too.[CR]Story Mode[CR]Stage 5 of Story Mode[CR]The campaign in Super Bomberman can be played by a single player as just White Bomberman, or co-operatively with 2P as Black Bomberman. Care should be taken as players bombs can kill each other.[CR]The story is set in Peace Town located in Diamond City which is Bomberman's hometown. Two villains, Carat Diamond and Dr. Mook, were holding a robot tournament to see which robots were the strongest. They then decided to kidnap Bomberman using a fake Bomberman to steal his technology with the aim of using this knowledge in a robot tournament. Black Bomberman knew what was happening and went on his own to head out and take out this fake robot. He fails and at the same time, his castle was taken from him. Black Bomberman warns White Bomberman of the threat, and together they try and defend Peace Town and defeat the evil robot Bombermen.[CR]There are 6 themed worlds consisting of 8 stages and a boss fight. The exit from one stage to the next can be found by destroying the destructible blocks. It can only be entered once all enemies have been defeated. Discovering the exit early on can prove a disadvantage, as hitting it with the flame from a bomb causes more enemies to emerge from it. The 5th stage takes the form of a gladiatorial battle with a series of robot Bombermen who each enter the arena in turn.[CR]Each stage features enemies with different abilities. Some examples of this are:Chameleons that change appearance to look exactly like White or Black Bombermen (potentially disastrous in co-op!)Enemies with springs for legs that can pass over walls.Enemies that disappear into tunnels and re-appear in other areas of the stage.Blue ball creatures that are attracted to and eat bombs placed near to them, preventing them from exploding.Tanks that shoot flames in random directions.Enemy bombs that float about and then explode exactly as the player's bombs - damaging each other and the environment.[CR]The Story Mode uses a password system rather than writing a saved game file.[CR]Multiplayer Versus Mode[CR]4 Player game with Punch, Kick and Rollerskate powerups visible.[CR]Super Bomberman was the first SNES game to feature 4 player simultaneous play. Since the SNES only featured 2 controller ports, a multitap add-on was needed that plugged into the Player 2 slot, allowing more controllers to be connected. Four players could compete in the Battle Mode, in which each player started in one of the map corners and had to use their bombs to kill each other. There are also environmental threats to consider such as springs that send the player high into the air (see image).[CR]Each game has a time limit of 2 minutes, and 1 hit kills each player. The last player standing wins a trophy, and the ultimate winner is decided by a series of games until 1 player wins a predefined number of trophies (1-5). Games are typically very hectic, but in the event of time running out the arena begins to shrink from the outside inward, crushing players who are caught under the falling blocks. If several players are still alive at the end, or if several die at the same time the game is considered a draw and no trophies are awarded.Stages[CR]Each of the stages (except for Normal Zone) has something unique:Normal ZoneWestern Zone - All players are in center box.Bomb Zone - Bombs are thrown into the stage.Jump Zone - There are springs on the stage so when a player jumps on one, they land in a random place in the stage.Belt Zone - A conveyor belt is placed in a box shape in the center.Tunnel Zone - Tunnels are placed which is perfect for hiding bombs to blast unsuspected players.Duel Zone - Only power-ups are surrounding the area and all players are trapped in soft blocks. They must to escape to claim all the power-ups.Flower Zone - All the flowers are soft blocks and once they are blown up, they are resurrected again.Light Zone - The stage is darkened but a light is shining and moves across the stage.Power Zone - All players have been powered up with no soft blocks in the stage.Warp Zone - 5 teleporters are placed on the stage and once the player lands on one, they rotate around the teleporters.Speed Zone - All players move really fast.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]When reviewed by Electronic Gaming Monthly the game received scores of 9,9,9 and 9 in addition to being awarded the Platinum Editor's Choice and Game of the Month. They stated, "...one of the most addictive games since Tetris...One of the best party games around! .. offers all the fun of of the original Bomberman and really spices it up with loads of new power-ups and a huge variety of techniques. The one-player mode is kinda cool but it really shines when four people are competing".[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] World 1-2 Maximum lives[CR]On world 1 level 2 blowing up the gate to the next level will make an ice cream cone appear on screen. Getting this item will give you 9 lives if you have not died once yet.</plot>

			<plot>Super Bomberman: Panic Bomber World is a puzzle game based on the popular  Bomberman series, which plays much like a cross between Bomberman and Puyo Puyo. Groups of blocks will fall from the top of the screen. Match three identical blocks and bombs will drop from the top of the screen. Occasionally, a lit bomb will fall and explode, setting off any bombs it hits and causing a chain reaction. The game is over when blocks fill the screen.[CR]It is essentially a variant of the console release of  Bomberman: Panic Bomber, though without the time challenge mode and with several additions. Most of the stages play the same way as in the earlier version, but they now have real-world names (such as "Jamaica"), and dialogue between Bomberman and his opponents was added.[CR]The game features a single-player story mode and a battle mode for up to four players.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] All Passwords[CR]Hold [B]L[/B] and [B]R[/B] when entering the passwords, otherwise they won't work!</plot>

			<title_clean>Super Bomber Man 4</title_clean>
			<plot>The fourth addition to the Bomberman series for the SNES.  This game is almost identical to Super Bomberman 3 only with new levels and a new story.[CR]A small twist in this game is that instead of choosing the traditional bomberman or a country specific character players get to choose between bosses from the previous game when playing battle mode.  Each character has a special power from a jet pack to throwing abilities.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Battle Stage Passwords[CR]Enter the passwords below using the 'password' option in the main menu, and you will be able to play different stages in battle mode. After entering the password, you will be taken back to the main menu. Simply select the 'battle game' option, then the first or third option, and you will be able to play different battle stages than usual.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Battle Stage Passwords[CR]Enter this code on the password screen, and you'll be taken back to the title screen. When you play a round of single mode (all players vs. each other player), the one who reaches the goal for wins turns gold the next round. This doesn't work for tag matches (multi-player cooperation matches)</plot>

			<plot>[CR]A special gold cartridge that came with an issue of Coro Coro comics was produced, featuring extra battle mode maps.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Cheat Characters[CR]In Config Battle Mode go to Password Load - enter these:[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] A list of all the passwords in the game[CR]They should be entered under the "Options" screen off the main menu. Each password changes either Battle Mode or Normal Mode, and after a correct password entry the game will automatically take you to the appropriate mode.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] A list of all the passwords in the game[CR]Have you ever wanted to play as carbon copies of the Fiendish Bombers in Config Battle Mode, but disliked how the game limited your palette and item selection choices?  Well, with these passwords, you can play as versions of the bosses with their correct palettes and all the Power-Ups they have when you fight them! (However, they still can't use their special moves, such as throwing Power-Downs or summoning enemies.)* = Gold Bomberman has maxed out Bombs, Fire-Ups, Speed, and holds the Remote Control, Soft Block and Bomb Pass, Power Glove, and Punch Glove items.  He's the equivalent of a fully-powered Single Player character.* = Subordinate Bomber's portrait is glitchy and will put junk graphics on the status bar, but this won't effect gameplay.  Do no let him win a Single Match or he will [B]crash the game[/B].  He's perfectly safe to use in a Tag Match though.  His stats are the same as his boss form if you kill Pirate Bomber first.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] A list of all the passwords in the game[CR]They should be entered under the "Options" screen off the main menu.

On his stats screen, his Bomb and Speed levels are at 8, The number that tells the level of his firepower is screwed up (Changing it will mess up your screen), he'll have all of the special items (I.E. Kick, Punch, Throw, Wall Passer, etc.), and he'll still have 98 build points left! Save him, and he'll be shown on the character select screen as a red X and his face is a red Bomberman because Hudson Soft didn't create a face of him. Playing as him will often cause weird, messed up sprites to appear on screen.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Configure Cheat[CR]This requires Hudson's Super Joycard controller.[CR]Have the X switch on the controller set to the middle and on the title screen hold X for about 6 seconds. A sound will confirm on success. These are the same stages found on the gold cartridge.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Chinese World 2: Uchuu Ichibuto Daikai (roughly "Super Chinese World 2: The Number One Cosmic Martial Arts Contest") is a martial arts brawler/fighter game featuring the martial arts twins Jack and Ryu (also known as Jacky and Lee) in another battle against innumerable foes. This sequel to Super Ninja Boy takes the duo into space to take down a conglomerate of evil alien martial artists who have kidnapped the leaders of the planets they've invaded. The pair move from planet to planet, beating up henchmen before finally taking down the boss in fighter-style duels (which one or both brothers can take part in).[CR]The game also features a competitive fighting mode for up to two players (and includes an option to watch two CPU opponents fight). This mode allows the player to play as any of the bosses encountered in the game. While the core game retains a few of its RPG elements, like character levels, the turn-based battles have been removed for the sake of a more action-focused game.[CR]Super Chinese World 2, unlike its predecessor, was never released in the US. A localization of the game named Galactic Defender was canceled mid-development. The game would be followed in 1995 with the third and final game in the Super Chinese World series: Super Chinese World 3: Chou Jigen Daisakusen.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Debug Menus[CR]At the password screen, enter the following Japanese characters to access the special password screen (format is Row #, Column #): - 1,7 - 3,9 - 2,6 -.

			<plot>Okay kid, wipe that drool off your chin and listen up if you really want to learn something about this game. Sure, it's got newfangled computer graphics and what Diddy calls stereo sound that 'rocks heavily and with little resistance!' BUT, the game play? Well, they FINALLY added some proper challenge to the game - a snap for me of course. AND THE STORY? You sure ask a lot of questions, kid! Kaptain K. Rool and his cruelest cut-throat Kremlings have kidnapped that flea-bitten ape Donkey Kong. I figured I'd rescue him when the little pip-squeak DIDDY pops up along with his girlfriend, and they head off fixin' to prove themselves heroes or something. Come to think of it, I haven't laid eyes on those two for quite a while. I just may have to help them out after all![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Access the Sound test[CR]When you get to the game select screen highlight two player contest and press down 5 times to get to music test and another 5 times to get to cheat mode. Once in cheat mode, press these buttons to activate the cheats:[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Beat Screechs Sprint Without Racing[CR]Once you get half way through "Screech's Sprint" you will transform into the bird, and, normally, you will fly up to Screech and the race will start.  If you come up right behind Screech to where the race will not start yet, and you fly upwards (you must have both characters at this point for this to work), you will then hit the the ceiling and hurt yourself causeing yourself to blink.  Quickly, while you are still blinking, pass Screech and head off to the rest of the level without having to worry about doing it in good time.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Extra ending[CR] Deafet K.K.Rool in the secret lost world boss to see an extra ending.[CR]Additionally, collect all 40 DK coins for an alterate extra ending.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Extra ending[CR]To unlock the Lost World, you must pass the first world. In the all the other worlds, you will start to find a ''Klubba's Koisk'' in each world. When you visit one, a Kremling named Klubba will ask you to give him 15 Kremcoins to enter The Lost World. If you do give 15 Kremcoins to Klubba in a particular world, you will unlock one particular level of the Lost World.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Rickety Race - Boost Barrel[CR]In Rickety Race, when you jump into the minecart, hold left. When the light turns green you will go backwards and hit a hidden "+" barrel which will cause your cart to drastically speed up -- even allowing you to plow through the first three racers instead of having to jump over them.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super F1 Circus is a F1 racing game from Cream and Nichibutsu (Nihon Bussan) and the first Super Famicom entry in the F1 Circus entry, which originated on the PC Engine (Turbografx-16) and Famicom. It is sponsored by Team Lotus, a former racing company associated with Formula 1 as well as many other racing leagues that has recently come back into being.[CR]The game is a traditional top-down racing game that emphasizes sim elements, such as selecting the car's various parts and ensuring that the rules of the race are followed. If the player causes too many infractions, or too much damage is caused to six vital instruments on the car, they will be forced out of the race.[CR]As well as the other games in the F1 Circus series, Super F1 Circus would receive numerous direct sequels of its own. Super F1 Circus Limited came out later the same year.</plot>

It focuses on the 1993/94 season and recreates circuits from sixteen different countries. The game offers a "quick race" mode that randomly picks a track and avoids the majority of the simulation elements.[CR]The game sits between Super F1 Circus 2 and Super F1 Circus Gaiden in the series. As with its predecessors, it has licenses from FOCA (the Formula One Constructors Association) and Fuji TV (the TV station that covers F1 in Japan) that allow it to depict actual teams/drivers from the Formula One World Championship. It was never released outside of Japan.[CR]The circuits include:Interlagos (Brazil) (presently known as Autodromo Jose Carlos Pace)TI Circuit Aida (Japan) (presently known as Okayama International Circuit)Imora (San Marino) (presently known as Autodromo Internazionale Enzo e Dino Ferrari)Monte Carlo (Monaco)Catalunya (Spain)Montreal (Canada) (actually the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve)Magny Cours (France)Silverstone (United Kingdom)Hockenheim (Germany)Hungaroring (Hungary)Spa Francorchamps (Belgium)Monza (Italy)Estoril (Portugal)Buenos Aires (Argentina)Suzuka (Japan)Adelaide (Australia)[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Pole Position guaranteed in every single race (World Championship and Spot Entry)[CR]During the Qualifying session, press Down and Select at the same time while pressing LR.

			<title_clean>Super F1 Circus Limited</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super F1 Circus Limited is largely identical to Cream's earlier Super Famicom racing game Super F1 Circus, however it was shortly after the release of that game that Cream was given permission by FOCA (Formula One Constructors' Union, an association of car manufacturers for Formula One) to use actual driver and team names for their subsequent Super F1 Circus games. Super F1 Circus Limited was quickly created to take advantage of this recent development.[CR]With the exception of the use of actual drivers/team names, there is no significant difference between this version of the game and the earlier Super F1 Circus. The series would see a proper sequel on the Super Nintendo, with enhanced graphics and additional features, with Super F1 Circus 2 in 1993.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Quick Ending[CR]Choose Options on the main menu, keep pressed L &amp; R then push A.Game will cycle thru the various in-game endings.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Family Tennis Singles[CR]Super Family Tennis, also known as Smash Tennis in Europe, is a tennis game made by Namco (via their in-house brand Namcot) for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and was released on the June 25, 1993 in Japan. The European version was localized and released by  Virgin Interactive the following year. The game follows the standard rules of tennis and provides a variety of characters and courts for players to play on.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Game Type Select[CR]The player controls their character's movements by using the D-pad, and the A, B, Y, and X buttons are for racket strokes. The A, B, and Y buttons are used for normal strokes, and the X button is used for lobbing the ball. While stroking, the player can choose the ball's direction and velocity. They do this by hitting left or right on the D-pad to choose the left or right direction and up or down to increase or decrease the ball's velocity. It is also possible to swing the racket early or late to increase the angle at which the ball is hit. The serve is accomplished by hitting a stroke button once to toss the ball in the air and again to hit it. While serving, hitting the ball when it's too high will cause it to go out and hitting it when it's too low will cause the ball to go into the net.[CR]The game uses only the real rules of tennis in the game, which means there are no novelty modes or specialized training drills as you sometimes find in more modern tennis games. At the title screen the player can choose from just two main gameplay modes and an options mode.Exhibition[CR]Exhibition mode allows the player to create any sort of match they want to play. The player can choose between singles or doubles and whether they want to play alone, with a friend, or just watch the computer AI play itself. Twenty different characters are selectable (12 male and 8 female), and there are 8 unique courts to choose from. The match can be comprised of 1, 3, or 5 sets.Tournament[CR]Tournament allows the player to choose a character and play in a series of ladder tournaments against progressively more challenging opponents. Tournaments can be singles or doubles, and the doubles tournaments can be played with a computer team mate or a second player.Options[CR]This gives an option to toggle the ball marker on or off and to switch between mono or stereo sound.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]MaleMikeJohnMattPeterIanBrianDanDarrenMarkPaulTonySteveFemaleHelenJulieCarolKirstySusanRoseMarinaNina[CR]Courts[CR]Resort CourtResort Court: A blue court with a tan out-of-bounds inside a ski resort lodge. Through the windows it's possible to see snow and some girls watch the match from a balcony.Lodge Court: A green court with a tan out-of-bounds. The court is fenced in by a green fence and the lodge is behind the courts. The match starts in a fog, but as it progresses the sun comes out and shadows of trees envelop the lower half of the court.Shrine Court: This court is reddish orange with a brown, rocky out-of-bounds. The court is in front of a traditional Japanese shinto shrine and has tranquil ponds and a Torii gate.Beach CourtBeach Court: This court is on a beach. There are palm trees, a friendly looking crab, and the ocean, in which there are surfers and swimmers lined up to watch the match.Mountain Court: This court is on top of a rocky mountain plateau. A great forest can be seen below in the background.Namco Grass Court, Namco Hard Court, Namco Clay Court: These courts are inside a stadium much like Wimbledon or the US Open. The courts each have different court surfaces.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Namco Theater Mode Passwords[CR]At the Namco Theater Mode password screen, press the A, B, X or Y buttons to enter the following combinations:[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Namco Theater Mode Passwords[CR]At the Tournament Mode password screen, press the A, B, X or Y buttons to enter the following combinations:</plot>

As with every Famista game prior, the athletes are presented as super deformed and the batting/pitching view is from directly behind the batter.[CR]Super Famista 2 would be followed up with three more sequels for the Super Famicom.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Fire Pro Wrestling is the first of eight Super Famicom games in Human's venerable wrestling series. As with the other games in the series, players assume the role of a fictionalized (but based on a real person) wrestler and compete with others in the ring, either in one-on-one matches or as part of a tag team. The gameplay is focused on performing timing-specific moves to wear down the opponent until they are weak enough to be successfully pinned, or put into a hold until they submit the match. Players can also land punches and kicks on their opponents, or throw them. [CR]Most of the fictional wrestlers are Japanese in origin, though a few (like Hulk Hogan and The Ultimate Warrior) are from the WWF (the former WWE).[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] CPU vs CPU Exhibition match.[CR]To watch two computer controlled opponents (CPU) face each other, hold the "X" button at the mode selection screen and choose "Exhibition" mode (the second option from the mode selection screen). While still holding the "X" button, select any Wrestler.  Now, with the second controller, choose an opponent to play against. If done correctly, both player's wrestlers will now be controlled by the Computer and  a CPU vs CPU match will begin. This code also works with tag team matches as well.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] CPU vs CPU Exhibition match.[CR]To unlock the 3 hidden bosses (B.G.

			<plot>Long before the WWE introduced the Divas wrestling matches, in Japan there was a more serious affair, where wrestling skill was more important than breast implants, and matches were "real" (as far as wrestling goes) instead of pillow-fighting or bra and panties fights.[CR]In this game in the Fire Pro Series, the cast of the All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling promotion are available, all fighting to win the Red belt, the highest prize of the federation. It's also possible to fight in single matches, tournaments, Battle Royal and Elimination matches. The usual array of options in CAW is present, being possible to create 16 new Wrestlers.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B], as usual is the series, is dramatically different than in most western games. Each wrestler has a bunch of moves, ranked from weak to strong. While it's possible to connect any of them from open situations, while grappling only when the opponent is already beaten the most powerful moves can be successfully used.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Unlock the boss characters[CR]To unlock the hidden boss characters Bull Nakano and Akira Hokuto, complete the "CHALLENGE" mode in either the singles or tag team tournament.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Fire Pro Wrestling III Final Bout is the third Super Famicom game (of eight) from Human Entertainment's Fire Pro Wrestling series. The action is once again presented in an isometric ring, and players must use timing-based button presses to effectively grapple and pin their opponents. The player can choose from a number of wrestlers, many of whom are from international circuits like the WWE and WCW, who are all homages to actual wrestlers under different names. The player could also make their own wrestler in the game's "create-a-wrestler" editor mode, a series staple.[CR]Super Fire Pro Wrestling III Final Bout was closely followed by a rerelease, Super Fire Pro Wrestling III EasyType, which simplified the controls and made the timing parts less stringent. It was released a mere five weeks after the original game. Though it lacks the editor mode, all hidden wrestlers are unlocked from the offset.[CR]Notably, Super Fire Pro Wrestling III Final Bout is the first Fire Pro Wrestling game Goichi "Suda51" Suda worked on. He would go on to pen the controversial story in 1994's Super Fire Pro Wrestling Special.

			<title_clean>Super Fire Pro Wrestling Special</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Fire Pro Wrestling Special is the fifth of eight Super Famicom Fire Pro Wrestling releases, and the ninth title in the entire series. The game was both developed and published by Human Entertainment, Inc., also known for the NES title Kabuki Quantum Fighter, and the PlayStation series Clock Tower. While the game did not stray from the the formula set by the prior Fire Pro Wrestling titles, it is well known for being the first game written by Goichi Suda, better known as Suda51, current CEO of Grasshopper Manufacturer. Overall it was only the second game he worked on, his first being Super Fire Pro Wrestling III: Final Bout, also for the Super Famicom, where he was credited as a director. The story, especially the ending, was considered controversial both during its release and even still today. The title was never released outside of Japan.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Super Fire Pro Wrestling Special, like other releases in the series, focuses on grappling using timing-based mechanics. Wrestlers also have signature moves which are more powerful, but less tactical. Along with the ability to play as and against various unlicensed wrestlers and fighters from around the world, the game also has a story-driven single player mode.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Along with the ability to create characters, a staple of the Fire Pro Wrestling series, the game is filled with unlicensed wrestlers and MMA fighters from around the world, including many WWF and WCW stars. Instead of directly giving these characters their real names, the developers used pseudonyms instead, including Axe Duggan for Hulk Hogan, Macho Sabre for Randy Savage, and Boss Rotten for Bas Rutten.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The single player story has the player as a rookie wrestler working his way up through the ranks. During the journey, he falls in love with the sister of a wrestler named Akira Saeha, based off Akira Maeda from Fighting Network Rings. The road to the championship bout is a struggle, with loss after loss, both inside and outside of the ring, including the player character accidentally killing his best friend during a match.[CR]Before the final battle against reigning world champion Dick Slender, based off real-life wrestler Ric Flair, the player character's girlfriend leaves him. To make matters worse, during the match Slender murders the player character's tag-team partner in the ring, and also confesses to killing his trainer before the fight.[CR]After winning the bout, the player character realizes that he was using wrestling as a means to fight off depression. With nobody left, and no higher to climb, three days later he commits suicide in his home.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Unlock all hidden characters and the Gruemsome Fighting mode[CR]To unlock all the hidden legends and the "Gruesome Fighting" mode, complete the "Champion Road" tournament.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Compete in the Legends Tournament[CR]To fight against the hidden Wrestlers in the Legends Tournament, start a new game in "Tournament" mode under default settings with 120 Wrestlers competing in total.  Then, using any Wrestler of choice, successfully win the first 7 Tournaments consecutively. Upon completion of the 7th Tournament, a special Legends Tournament will begin with a cast of legendary and hidden Wrestlers as your opponents.</plot>

			<title_clean>Super Fire Pro Wrestling X Premium</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Fire Pro Wrestling X Premium (hereafter SFPWXP) is a technically-focused wrestling game released for the Super Famicom in 1996 in Japan. It features more than 80 wrestlers, most of whom are based on real personalities from Hulk Hogan to Ken Shamrock, but with the names changed to avoid copyright infringement. It developed a significant U.S. following through the use of emulators, including fan-made translation patches to change Japanese text to English and convert the fake names of the wrestlers into their actual names.  [CR]Unlike the typical western wrestling games, SFPWXP does not feature &#8220;sports entertainment&#8221; trappings such as cage matches, ladder matches, folding chairs, breakaway tables, or any strong personality elements for the individual characters (with the exception of taunts). Instead, the game focuses on the more technical aspects of wrestling, including a very deep roster of suplexes and submission holds. SFPWXP contains an exhibition mode, singles and tag team Championship &#8220;Quests,&#8221; a 4-Man Battle Royale, and an elimination tournament. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]SFPWXP uses a fairly unforgiving timing-based system for grappling (unlike other more button-mash friendly wrestling games), where the player must press the button for the grapple they want (weak, medium, or strong) at the exact moment the two wrestlers put their arms together for a collar-and-elbow tie-up. The player with the better timing is the one who gets to execute their attack. Your opponent must be weakened before the medium or strong attacks are possible, otherwise they are automatically reversed. [CR]Create-a-Wrestler[CR]SFPWXP was among the first wrestling games to feature an in-depth create-a-wrestler (hereafter CAW) program, with a capability of storing up to eighty CAWs on one cartridge. The player can choose the CAW&#8217;s appearance, outfit, stats (distributed from a fixed number of stat points, with more stat points available if the single-player Championship &#8220;Quest&#8221; modes have been completed), and move set.  [CR]The amount of moves available to choose from are extensive, and include not only dozens of strike attacks, grapples, running attacks, and diving attacks, but also multiple special grapples from the top rope (including several variations of the Superplex), a wide variety of attacks from inside the ring to the outside (i.e. a Cross-Body Plancha), and many, many more. Unlike more modern games, there were no restrictions on what types of moves could be performed by different sizes of wrestlers, so a light-heavyweight could easily perform a Power Bomb on a heavyweight (assuming the heavyweight was sufficiently weakened). [CR]It was a common practice in the years following SFPWXP&#8217;s release for players using an emulator to upload save files full of CAWs to special fan sites. Additionally, players would post step-by-step guides for CAWs, allowing other players to make the CAWs themselves and develop a custom roster, as the existing save files could not be mixed and matched. [CR]Notable Characters[CR]Some of the more well-known wrestlers who had unauthorized carbon copies pre-loaded into SFPWXP are:  Hulk Hogan The Undertaker The Steiner Bros.The Legion of DoomVaderThe Ultimo Dragon SabuThe Great Muta Chris BenoitTAKA MichinokuJushin &#8220;Thunder&#8221; Liger Ken ShamrockJohnny Ace[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Unlock all hidden characters[CR]To unlock all the hidden characters, complete the two tournaments (in any order) in "Title Match" mode[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Unlock all hidden characters[CR]To unlock the hidden "Title Match" mode, complete the World Championship mode in either the Singles or Tag team division.Once World Championship mode is completed, Title Match mode will be added to the menu selection screen.</plot>

It was developed by Geo Factory (their second Super Famicom game, after Super Jinsei Game) and published by Naxat Soft. The player, as an avid fisherman in a green backwards cap, is invited to participate in a multi-stage fishing contest that takes place across Japan.[CR]The game uses a third-person behind-the-angler perspective, and the player can select a spot in each of the game's fishing areas and pick which direction to cast their line. There are different lures and bait that the player can use which all perform differently and attract different fish. [CR]The game was followed in 1997 with a Sega Saturn sequel: Top Anglers: Super Fishing Big Fight 2.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Formation Soccer II is a soccer game from Human Entertainment and is the follow up to Super Formation Soccer, a.k.a. Super Soccer. Like its forebear, Super Formation Soccer II depicts the pitch from a low bird's eye angle, using the Super Famicom's Mode 7 to depict a depth of field.[CR]The game uses national teams, though the player is free to create their own "All-Star" team by mixing and matching the soccer players in the game. They can select from an exhibition match, a penalty shoot-out mode or a tournament called the Human Cup.[CR]Newly added to the second Super Formation Soccer is the inclusion of three and four player multiplayer, with the use of a multitap peripheral. There are pre-set options for one vs one, two vs one (the one can be human or CPU) and two vs two, rather than the now standard system of allowing each player to move their controller icon to either team.TeamsAmericaArgentinaBelgiumBrazilCameroonColombiaDenmarkEnglandFranceGermanyHollandItalyJapanRomania (misspelled Rumania in-game)SpainSweden[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Game Codes[CR]Enter the following codes at the title screen</plot>

Gachapon refers to capsule machines: "Gachapon" is the Japanese onomatopoeia of a crank turning and a toy capsule dropping. The game is so named because new units are acquired by turning the crank on enormous capsule machines.[CR]The game is a pseudo-sequel to SD Gundam World: Gachapon Senshi: Scramble Wars for the Famicom.</plot>

			<plot>The fourth game in the regular "Bonk" caveman series, Bonk is back on his first Super Nintendo outing.[CR]In this side-scrolling platformer adventure, the gameplay is similar to Bonk 3. Super Bonk allows Bonk to travel through time from his prehistoric levels, the insides of a dinosaur, a version of modern Chinatown, and even the moon! Along the way, Bonk can find power-ups that can change his form to creatures such as a shooting Bonk crab, a dinosaur form called "Big Kronk", find candies that change his size from tiny to huge, travel through transportation tubes, and find multiple bonus levels.[CR]Bonk still uses his head to smash his enemies, propeller seeds that allow Bonk to fly, and for the first time, can carry spring flowers on his head in his continuing battle against his arch nemesis, King Drool!</plot>

			<plot>&#65279;In this sidescrolling action-platformer, Bonk is once again trying to save his world from the evil clutches of the reptilian king, who once more is threatening the prehistoric era.  Boy, you'd think that after being defeated four times prior that he would take a hint.  This time, you also get to face his five best soldiers, who will try to stop you in your tracks.  Bonk controls rather smoothly, and he is really fun to control.  To those of you that are not familiar with the series, Bonk is a caveman who attacks his enemies with his noggin; after jumping down, from below, while swimming, and while in the air.  He can even bounce off walls with his head, skip on the water like a stone if his head is facing down, climb certain walls with his teeth, scale up waterfalls, flip in the air (so long as the attack button is repeatedly being tapped), and so forth.  As is the case with the series, you start with a regular amount of health, but if you find a translucent heart icon, you'll increase your capacity.  What's neat is how collecting the food not only scores you some points but how it also replenishes a little bit of your health, too.  This time Bonk can also run if you hold down the A button, and the X button is used if you have a special ability on you.  If you find a power-up, whether it be piece of meat, or a different icon, then you will be given a power-up ability that will be taken out the moment you're hit once (damn).  Among the power-ups are the one where the fire will be spreading if Bonk hits his head on the ground (you know, the one where he looks freaky), one where Bonk turns into a bird and gains the ability to fly, one where Bonk becomes tiny and can make platforms made out of Japanese characters, and there is one where Bonk has the ability to double-jump as a girl.  Yes, Bonk becomes a girl if he eats the pink-colored meat.  I'm dead serious.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Gomoku Narabe Renju ("Super Five Piece Line-Up Renju") is a board game adaptation for the Super Famicom developed and published by Naxat Soft. The game is played with a Go board and pieces, but the goal is to simply line up five pieces horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The game has a few modes, including a tournament mode in which the player takes on CPU opponents of increasing difficulty.[CR]The last Gomoku Narabe Renju adaptation for a Nintendo console was also one of the earliest games released for the original Famicom. It was created by Nintendo themselves and is otherwise unrelated to Super Gomoku Narabe Renju.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Hanafuda is a 1994 Super Famicom game that simulates hanafuda: a type of traditional card game where two players have to earn points by creating certain combos with the cards in their hand and the cards face-up on the table. Nintendo themselves are known for being producers of hanafuda cards before they eventually moved to video games, and many hanafuda simulators were created for Nintendo platforms to homage their history.[CR]Super Hanafuda was joined that year by Honke Hanafuda and Hanafuda Ou, both for the Super Famicom. The same developer/publisher team would go on to create Super Hanafuda 2 in October 1995.</plot>

			<title_clean>Super Inindou - Datou Nobunaga</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Inindo: Way of the Ninja, or Inindo Datou Nobunaga in Japan, is a fantasy JRPG that is based loosely on the Warring States Era of Japanese history. The premise of the game sees the player control of a band of heroes and mercenaries in a quest to defeat the tyrannical daimyo Nobunaga Oda before he can conquer all of Japan.[CR]Koei developed and published the game for many home systems as a companion for their more realistic Nobunaga's Ambition series of strategy war sims set in the same historical period. It was eventually remade with better graphics for the SNES, where it is known as Super Inindo Datou Nobunaga in Japan.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game uses a turn-based combat system to fight battles while exploring dungeons. Many of the game's dungeons are optional, but the player must take risks. The game features a time limit, and the player's party must be sufficiently leveled and powered up if Nobunaga is to be defeated before the time limit expires. This means that the player must be willing to take on optional content to increase the party's strength without allowing too much time to pass.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Gain Money Without Passing Time[CR]This method is a lengthy, but otherwise practical way to earn money without having to fight in battles or performing tasks that all use game time. First off, you need a Healer Companion on your team (Like a Sage or Hermit), and they have to have the Special Skill(s) Cure 1 and/or Cure 2. Second, you have to be in a Castle/Village that sells Health Food and/or Energy Pills. All skills in this game do not use magic, making this moneymaking method very practical. With the Cure 1, you can convert Health Food (that costs 40) into Body Healer items (that costs 80) and with the Cure 2, you can convert Energy Pills to Energy Ups. Stock up on Health Food (Or Energy Pills if you have Cure 2), give them to your Healer, and use Cure 1 so that all Health Food turn into Body Healers. Once you have all converted Health Food to Body Healers, sell these Body Healers for 56 Gold, earning a 16 gold piece profit. Same thing with Energy Pills, convert with Cure 2, and sell the Energy Ups for profits. Repeat the Buy, Convert, and Sell process as many times as you need to so you have all the money you can ever have so you can buy strong weapons and items in a town.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Jinsei Game is a video game adaptation of Milton Bradley's The Game of Life board game. Takara, the Japanese license holders for the game, commissioned a number of video game adaptations of the Jinsei Game (as the board game is known in Japan). This particular game is the first of three Super Famicom games, and is followed by 1995's Super Jinsei Game 2 and 1996's Super Jinsei Game 3. Geo Factory worked on Super Jinsei Game, but KID would go on to develop its two sequels.[CR]Up to four players take turns moving around the board, encountering events that either increase or decrease their current status. They must travel through childhood and various schools before they encounter adult problems like university and finding work. The player who earns the most money at the end is deemed the winner.</plot>

It is based on the Kaze no Sylphid manga: a dramatic serial manga concerning a young boy and a foal, Sylphid, who the boy is determined to raise and race even though the horse was born with tendinitis.[CR]The game is part simulation management game and part racing game, as the player takes control of both the owner as he operates the day-to-day business of the ranch and as the young boy who eventually becomes Sylphid's jockey.[CR]	</plot>

It crosses Pipe Dream with something like Rampart, in that the player is trying to create as many closed circuits of pipe pieces as possible.

If they complete enough closed loops of sufficient size, they move onto the next stage. Bonus stages have no end point; the goal of these is to earn as many points as possible.[CR]The game was planned for a US release as Super Loops, but was canceled mid-localization.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Arcade Passwords[CR]Enter these passwords on the Arcade screen after highlighting Password.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Arcade Passwords[CR]Enter these on the Puzzle Screen after highlighting Password.</plot>

			<title_clean>Super Mario - Yossy Island</title_clean>
			<plot>The Evil Magikoopa, Kamek, is out to kidnap Baby Mario! In this sequel to Super Mario World, you play as Yoshi. Your goal is to successfully carry Baby Mario back to his parents in the Mushroom Kingdom while avoiding all of Kamek's clever traps and evil minions. Enjoy the various backgrounds of the rich and vibrant locales of Yoshi's Island as you race to complete your quest.Is Yoshi up to the momentous task at hand? Help him toss his eggs, manipulate unique objects and solve puzzling situations! When in doubt, don't be afraid to try EVERYTHING!![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Access Other Levels[CR]Note that this glitch requires a controller that allows pressing both Left and Right on the D-Pad simultaneously.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Access Other Levels[CR]During the introductory level of the game, grab a certain number of Coins, depending on where you want to go. 0 or 9 Coins brings you to Extra 1, 1-8 Coins brings you through to that level of World 1 (i.e. 5 Coins = World 1-5), 10 Coins to the Bonus game for World 1, 11 Coins to a glitched level, 12 Coins to the intro level, and then 13-15 Coins brings you to World 2-1, 2-2, and 2-3 respectively. (These values loop based on 16, so you can still do this at higher Coins if needed. For example, 37 will bring you to World 1-5, as 37 divided by 16 has a remainder of 5.) With this achieved, use Start and then Select to leave the level and return to the map. There, press Left and Right together, then an less than half a second after begin holding the A Button. The cursor will glitch up a little, but you will soon transition to the named destination level.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Access Other Levels[CR]What this glitch will do is essentially make 1-2 into the level you've chosen. It is recommended to only do this with World 1-2 to 1-8 because of this. If you go any further, you won't be able to play normally. Upon resetting the game and reloading, you cannot play World 1-1 or any levels you've actually skipped, though the levels you've played will act normally.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Access Other Levels[CR]When getting a Big Egg (as in World 2-7), you can carry it to another level. Go to the Goal Ring and past it to the right side of the screen. Aim the Big Egg straight up, launch it, then lick it with your tongue; repeat as necessary until the Big Egg is launched to to the right and about half off-screen. Then enter the Goal Ring. The next Yoshi to come will pick up the Egg, carrying it with the others and Mario to the next level. Note that the Big Egg's graphics will glitch up, but it'll retain its normal functions.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Access Other Levels[CR]In several levels in the game, there are Shy Guys which are flying in the air with a red sack beneath them. Normally, if you eat or kill the Shy Guy, it will drop the Red Coin. If it drops the Red Coin, but you don't pick it up and instead run off-screen, you can then return to where the Shy Guy appeared. The Red Coin will be there still, but that Shy Guy will come in holding yet another Red Coin.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Access Other Levels[CR]You must have the +10 or +20 star item in your pause screen or it won't work. It works on any level that has a metamorphosis bubble, but it works best on level 5-5 (Goonie Rides!!), where I discovered it. In 5-5, reach the first middle ring, and then you will notice the metamorphosis helicopter bubble ahead. Don't touch it yet. Instead, walk to the edge of the cliff. You will see the white Goonies flying your way. Let one hit you and let baby Mario cry in the air. Now, before the timer runs out, run left until the helicopter bubble is at the right edge of the screen. Don't move from there. Baby Mario will float around the helicopter bubble. Let the timer reach zero. When the red Toadies come and begin carrying him away, lick baby Mario from them, and quickly touch the helicopter bubble while the timer is still 0. When you finish morphing, the Toadies will come back and try to take baby Mario with them, even though you're a helicopter (Don't touch the baby while they are trying to take him, or you will freeze the scroll of the screen!). Now, when all four Toadies are about to take off with baby Mario, immediately pause the game and activate a +10 or +20 stars item. The red Toadies will let go of baby Mario, but he will still be crying in his bubble (and you are a helicopter!). Now touch baby Mario as a helicopter. The bubble will pop and then baby Mario will be stuck in a tiny bubble that doesn't even close around him (If you dont touch him as a helicopter, theres a glitch when the helicopter runs out: youll get Mario back, but the timer wont countdown if you get hit, as long as you dont touch a helicopter bubble again). Now, you can do one of two things:[CR]a) Wait until the helicopter power runs out. If that happens, you will be transformed back into Yoshi. But notice anything strange? Baby Mario is still in that tiny bubble, and he is off your back! Now this is the cool thing though. You can lick baby Mario and he will go into Yoshi's mouth! If you swallow him, he will turn into an egg that can't damage Goonies! If you spit him back out, he will still be in the tiny bubble and slide around until he falls off the stage. You can't even lick him back into your mouth![CR]b) Head to the Yoshi Block as a helicopter at the end of this part of the stage. Avoid the Goonies and Green Piranas, and hit the Yoshi Block. The baby will transport where you are, and you will transform back into Yoshi. But the funny thing is that once again, you have no Baby Mario on your back. And Mario's bubble will return to normal size, but he will start floating up infinitely! You will lose him unless you can lick him before he floats away. Now, you can swallow him again and turn him into an egg, but if you spit him out, he will float around in his bubble up and down and move horizontally (you'll see what I mean) and won't stop. If you happen to spit him at a winged cloud, he will activate it but Mario will explode in the process! You cannot lick Baby Mario back into your mouth if you spit him out either.[CR]These are fun glitches to try but remember that you must have the +10 or +20 star item and must have a metamorphosis bubble in the course. I have succeeded in other courses with many Yoshi shapes. But let me warn you that if you pull off this glich, you cannot leave the course or beat it without pressing start and select. Oh, and you will have baby Mario on your back again if you do leave the course. Have fun pulling this one off, gamers![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Access Other Levels[CR]This glitch must be done in the final stage of the game, World 6-8, and you must have 0 lives to be able to execute the underflow. Early in the stage, when you have four numbered doors to choose from, enter Door #1. There, go along the path to a ! Switch near a long lava pit. Here, you need to carefully angle your jump so that you will land in the lava and, in turn, leap onto the ! Switch. Landing on the lava initially will kill Yoshi; however, Yoshi will also leap up from the burn during his death animation. If he strikes the ! Switch in that time, he will be considered to be alive again, although one live has already been lost in most situations. However, if you execute this glitch such that you have zero extra lives per the pause menu, you'll find that you now have a whopping 999 lives due to the underflow.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Access Other Levels[CR]Note that improper execution of this glitch can and will lead to the game hanging. First, in World 2-2, find a Mouser. Let it grab one of Yoshi's eggs; while the Mouser goes off-screen, take back the egg. At this point, the "egg" is counted as an empty slot, although you have it. Get a Skull-capped Mouser to enter the inventory by making it spawn on-screen, then complete the level as normal. Go to World 1-8 and proceed as normal to boss: before entering the boss door, have only one egg available. Attack Salvo on the other side of the door by using this egg and the smaller bodies that split off of Salvo when hit -- do not destroy any of them by jumping or ground-pounding them. After, go to any level: the "door unlock" cutscene from the end of World #-8 levels will immediately play. Play through the glitched level without falling into lava or being eaten by Piranha Plants, and do not lose the Key. In this manner, you will cause the game to consider that the credits have rolled, as if you've finished the game. You can also experiment with this glitch to get certain other items in your inventory, such as a glitch pipe to World 1-1 that allows quick level completion.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Access Other Levels[CR]In World 1-4, partway through there is a locked door next to a pipe. Enter the pipe. When you land, begin holding the button to aim an Egg, then walk backwards and hit the Hothead so that you're hurt. Go on the platform to the right without grabbing Baby Mario, then Flutter upwards towards the exit. Yuo should end up grabbing Mario while above the screen. You will glitch the game and warp to the top-left bit of World 1-1. Flutter Jump to the right as much as possible whilst falling (you'll die if you don't) and you'll fall on part of World 1-1. You can finish the level from there as you would 1-1, with the benefits of being able to gain extra Red Coins, Stars, and Flowers from the level; further, the score earned will be counted towards 1-4 and it will also count as you finishing 1-4![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Access Other Levels[CR]In World 2-1, partway through the level you need to go down a pipe with a red down-pointing arrow on it (you will see another similar pipe to the right of there, with an up arrow). Whilst standing on it, press Down and the Jump Button together. You will glitch the game and warp to the top-left bit of World 1-1. Flutter Jump to the right as much as possible whilst falling (you'll die if you don't) and you'll fall on part of World 1-1. You can finish the level from there as you would 1-1, with the benefits of being able to gain extra Red Coins, Stars, and Flowers from the level; further, the score earned will be counted towards 2-1 and it will also count as you finishing 2-1![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Access Other Levels[CR]In World 3-1, partway through, you'll reach a Middle-Ring. Nearby, you'll find a watermelon-seed-spitting monkey. Jump from his head to up and above the Middle-Ring; you'll get an extended jump boost. While doing floating above and to the right of the ring, you'll want to try to enter the hidden bonus area.  You will glitch the game and warp to the top-left bit of World 1-1. Flutter Jump to the right as much as possible whilst falling (you'll die if you don't) and you'll fall on part of World 1-1. You can finish the level from there as you would 1-1, with the benefits of being able to gain extra Red Coins, Stars, and Flowers from the level; further, the score earned will be counted towards 3-1 and it will also count as you finishing 3-1![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Access Other Levels[CR]Partway through 4-7, you will be able to shoot down a springball that's hidden above the screen. (It is where the fish enemies fly leftward at you and there's an impassable wall to the left.) Shoot down the springball and use it to reach another. As you use this one and go to the next screen from the jump, hold Left. You will glitch the game and warp to the top-left bit of World 1-1. Flutter Jump to the right as much as possible whilst falling (you'll die if you don't) and you'll fall on part of World 1-1. You can finish the level from there as you would 1-1, with the benefits of being able to gain extra Red Coins, Stars, and Flowers from the level; further, the score earned will be counted towards 4-7 and it will also count as you finishing 4-7![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Title Screen Stars[CR]To append stars next to the logo at the game's title screen, you must complete every single level in a given world: this includes the extra levels earned by getting 100 points on the other eight levels in the world. One star will appear for each world completed in such a manner, for a total of up to six stars at the title screen.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Title Screen Stars[CR]To unlock a bonus level and one of the 6 bonus games (when you get a flower on a roullete on the end of the level), finish a world with a 100 on each level to unlock the level and bonus game. These levels are tough for beginners. Here are the bonus games unlocked in each world:[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Title Screen Stars[CR]World 1: Flip Cards[CR]World 2: Scratch 'n' Match[CR]World 3: Drawing Lots[CR]World 4: Match Cards[CR]World 5: Roulette[CR]World 6: Slot Machine[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Instantly Kill Naval Piranha[CR]When you are in the hallway right before you reach the room of World 3's boss Naval Piranha, start to swim slowly into the room, until you are right in front of the column of falling water. You can just see the untransformed Naval Piranha, but you haven't gone far enough to trigger Kamek's appearance. There, jump straight up, and, before you fall, aim and shoot an egg at the Piranha. When the egg hits the Naval Piranha, Kamek will appear, scream "OH MY!!!" and then flee, and the Piranha will be destroyed, without you having to battle it.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Instantly Kill Naval Piranha[CR]It's best to have a full supply of green eggs for this trick. Find a place in a level where you can aim straight up without hitting anything else (ie: level 6-8 would be a good one, after you hit a door, but don't go in yet). Stock up on eggs if you don't have any, then aim straight up. Throw an egg and after it hits the celeing once, have Yoshi catch it with his tongue. It should stop bouncing and be a yellow egg (if it was green to begin with). Throw another egg, this time letting it hit the celeing twice, then catch it. It should have turned red. Doing this trick right will help you make your score better, as red eggs give 2 stars that can be used on the Baby Timer that appears when Mario falls off Yoshi's back.</plot>

			<plot>Revisit the magic and fun of the classic Super Mario Bros. series on your Super NES! All the great Super Mario Bros. games for the NES have been powered up with 16-bit graphics and sound and collected on one super game pak. As an added bonus, the previously unreleased 'Lost Levels' are included. These super challenging courses have never been available in this country until now![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Acceleration Glitch (Super Mario Bros. 3)[CR]Note this glitch requires the use of a SNES controller that allows you to press both Left and Right on the D-Pad simultaneously. This glitch also only works on Super Mario Bros. 3 and only on the All-Stars releases of this game. By pressing both Left and Right, Mario (or Luigi) will move very, very quickly to the right - much faster than is normally possible, even when your P-Meter is maxed. This makes it much easier to get to the goal in a small amount of time (thus meaning more points) and also makes some gaps, previously uncrossable, now crossable.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] (SMB 3) Hidden White Mushroom Houses[CR]In certain levels, the screen moves forward and pushes you along. If you get a certain number of coins within these said levels, you unlock a secret white mushroom house holding a powerful item. Below are the levels and the number of coins needed in each level.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To ''hide'' behind scenery, simply hold down for a couple seconds while standing on a white block. Then your player can ''hide'' behind scenery for about thirty seconds.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To get an Extra Life, make sure that when you touch the flagpole, the last digit of the timer is a multiple of the number of coins you have (Example: TIMER = 231/COINS = 11). This also works with 0. Do this correctly and instead of getting a point bonus, you will get a 1-UP.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]If you finish a level (touch the flagpole) when the ones digit of the time is 1, 3, or 6, there will be that many fireworks and each one is worth 500 points.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]Get on top of the ceiling in world 4-2 and run past the end pipe that leads to the flagpole. You will find a lone pipe that warps you to world 5[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To find a Warp Zone that can take you Level 2, 3, or 4 go to the part of world 1-2 then get to the part of the world at the end  where all the platforms are moving up.  Jump on one, then leap on top of the ceiling from there.  Keep going until you reach five pipes.  It'll say ''Welcome to Warp Zone!'' with a number above each pipe.  The 2 takes you to level 2, the three to level 3, and the four to level four.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]Go to world 4-2 [CR]Go past the first set of down platforms to 3 seemingly unreachable blocks. [CR]Uncover 2 invisible blocks under the rightmost and center bricks by jumping. Hit the left brick to sprout a vine. Climb the vine up and proceed right.

Place the potion close to the vase and go through the door to Sub Space. [CR]Stand on top of the vase while in Sub Space and press Down on the d-pad to warp to World 4-1[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]Go to world 1-3 and find a potion. Now find the vase next to the brick building all the way to the right side of the level. Drop the potion and go into Sub-Space  [CR]Warp into the vaseby standing on top of it and pressing Down on the d-pad. You will warp to World 4.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]Go to World 3-1 and enter the door to the waterfall and clouds. Drop down the waterfall to a door way down below. Find the potion in the huge patch of vegetables and take it to the vase next to the door.

[CR]Now use the first Warp Whistle on the map screen to warp to the warp zone. Then while still in the warp zone (without warping) use the 2nd whistle. It will send you to the isolated World 8 Pipe.  [CR]Using a warp whistle to get to the warp zone then using another whistle in the warp zone itself takes you to level 8 no matter where you are. [CR]You can also reach World 8 by using the warp whistle in World 7 once.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]At the end of the game, when Bowser uses his jump attack on you, duck if you are big Mario, or stay still if you are small Mario. Bowser will break the bricks, but he won't hurt you. If you are small Mario, you can run right through Bowser and not get hurt.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]In other words, Bowser's lower half is harmless, but his upper half can still hurt you.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]Complete levels until you get to toads mushroom house, where you get to open a chest for an item. Get the item, save and exit.

Also this works for the extra lives slot and the memory card game houses too.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To turn a wandering hammer brother (the ones that walk about on the world map) into a white ship full of coins, collect a number of coins that is a multiple of 11. Make the tens digit in your score match the multiple of 11. Stop the timer at the end of the stage that you are playing in on an even number.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]One combination would be: 11 coins, 9,310 as your score, and the timer at 104. This only works in worlds 1, 3, 5, and 6.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]Make sure you're Fire Mario/Luigi when you reach Bowser. Blast him with fireballs, but don't grab the axe just yet. Instead, wait the timer out, but make sure you're next to the axe when there's about 50 seconds left. Now get ready and time your jump on the axe so the Timer reads '000'. Once you reach Toad and the game adds the Timer to your score, you may notice that it changed from '000' to '999'. Thus the game thinks you finished with '1000' on the Timer and times that by 5.   Note: this does not work on the Original NES version of the game.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To get the N-Spade card game to appear on the World Map. You must do gain 80,000 points as one player, and successfully beat the stage that you broke the 80,000 points with.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR][B]Level 1-3[/B][CR]Find the white block near the end and crouch on to of it for 5 seconds.

Then engage the hammer brother on the other side. You should get a chest with a Warp Whistle.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To warp to Worlds 2, 3,or 4 during World 1-2, go to the end where the 2 platforms are rising, get on the first platform, and use it to jump onto the highest structure in the middle, then jump on the next rising platform, but this time, when it reaches the top, jump onto the TOP of the level. Walk foward and drop down the small jump, and you can now warp to Worlds 2, 3, or 4 by going down the desired tube, and pressing down.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]To warp to World 6,7 or 8 during World 4-2, go to the place where three blocks are can be seen (where a pipe can also be seen). Jump below the third block where you can reveal a secret block but be careful on jumping below the 1st block because you can't break it thus going to the secret warp world unless you are a small Mario. Then step on to it and break the 2nd and the 3rd block. After you have done this, go down, then jump again below the second block now (it should have been broken now). The position of the two revealed blocks must be a stair from right to left. Anyway, step on to the 2nd block then braek the 1st block and there you can see the vine going up. Climb until you reach the day light again. Get some coins if you wish and you can now see three pipes like in the secret warp Worlds 2,3 and 4. Go down your desired pipe.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]At the very end place of world 4-2 (where you can see the pipe going to the flag) jump on the long pipe and break the brick above it and go through the end and you can see the pipe going to the World 5.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hide behind scenery (Super Mario Brothers 3)[CR]In Super Mario Brothers: Lost Levels, if you complete the game without warping, (Going through worlds 1-8, AND world 9), then you will move on to 4 secret special worlds. Worlds A, B, C, and D.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]To access this warp, you must be Super or Fiery Mario. Go to the pipe at the end of the level and jump on top of it. Jump up and break the block over top of the part of the pipe farthest left. Then, position Mario on the edge of the pipe, with one foot hanging off the edge. Duck, then jump backwards as far right as possible.  If done just right, Mario will slide through the pipe and the bricks. Walk over to the warp zone area and enter the middle pipe. This pipe will take you to world 5, level 1. The same area can be acessed from a pipe in the same place in 4-2. However, this is meant to be a warp zone to 5-1, whereas the 1-2 warp to 5-1 is a glitch. After completing the jump trick in level 1-2, you can also go down either of the other two pipes, both of which will take you to Minus World -1. [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]This only works with mushrooms and fire flowers. Reveal a power up from under any block which contains one. Now jump onto the power up and release the A button. As Mario is transitioning to the next power up, hold down the A button, and Mario will jump in mid-air![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]Go to either 1-4, 2-4,3-4, etc. and get to Bowser. Make sure you are Big Mario and try to jump over Bowser or run under him. Stand near the Axe and Bowser will start to walk towards you. As he gets near you, jump high, and touch Bowser and the Axe at the same time. If you do it correctly, you will hear the sound as if you were to shrink, but you will just flash and stay big.  Go to the next stage, and get a Mushroom. (Yes, there will be a Mushroom instead of a Fire Flower.) When you touch the Mushroom, you will shrink. Then get a Fire Flower, and you'll have Fire Power as small Mario. (Note: after you do the Bowser/Axe trick, enemies that touch you will be able to kill you when you are Big Mario. When they touch you while you are small Mario after getting the Mushroom or Fire Flower, you will turn back into Big Mario.) [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]This glitch only works in the castle levels where you fight Bowser at the end - for example, World 1-4, 2-4, 3-4, and so on. It is best to defeat Bowser with Fire Mario or Fire Luigi beforehand, as you must wait out most of the timer to execute this glitch. At the end of the castle levels, there is an axe which you must touch to end the level. If you time your jump correctly (a full jump as the timer goes from 002 to 001 often works) and land on the axe while the timer reads "000", you'll continue as normal to the usual sequence at the end of the castle. However, your timer bonus (50 points per second remaining) will be calculated as if you had 999 seconds, not zero, left on the clock. This allows for an easy 49,950 point boost! Note that this glitch, if executed on levels using a flagpole, will prevent you from earning the bonus in that level.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]Get to world 3-1, and become Super Mario. At the end of the level, by the staircase before the end flag, you will see two turtles coming down the stairs. Jumping over the first one and then jumping on the second one should cause it to hit the star and bounce back. From here, jump on it and keep yourself off the ground for unlimited 1-ups.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]After beating the game, if you do not turn off the console, you will return to the title screen. There, you can press the B Button to start as desired in World 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]If you just walk along the sea floor, Bloopers will never be able to kill you because they are forced back up just before they hit the floor(or you).[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]If you run out of lives and want to continue then at the game over screen press and hold A then press start at 1 player (or 2 player) and you will start at the beginning of the world at which you died![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]To warp to Worlds 2, 3,or 4 during World 1-2, go to the end where the 2 platforms are rising, get on the first platform, and use it to jump onto the highest structure in the middle, then jump on the next rising platform, but this time, when it reaches the top, jump onto the TOP of the level. Walk foward and drop down the small jump, and you can now warp to Worlds 2, 3, or 4 by going down the desired tube, and pressing down.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]To warp to World 6,7 or 8 during World 4-2, go to the place where three blocks are can be seen (where a pipe can also be seen). Jump below the third block where you can reveal a secret block but be careful on jumping below the 1st block because you can't break it thus going to the secret warp world unless you are a small Mario. Then step on to it and break the 2nd and the 3rd block. After you have done this, go down, then jump again below the second block now (it should have been broken now). The position of the two revealed blocks must be a stair from right to left. Anyway, step on to the 2nd block then braek the 1st block and there you can see the vine going up. Climb until you reach the day light again. Get some coins if you wish and you can now see three pipes like in the secret warp Worlds 2,3 and 4. Go down your desired pipe. [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]This is a pretty commonly known secret. If you touch the flagpole of any level with either 1, 3, or 6 seconds left on the ones place of the timer, you will get that amount of fireworks. For example, if you touch the flagpole with 126 seconds left on the time, you will get six fireworks! [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]Well this secret is so easy. At the very end place of world 4-2 (where you can see the pipe going to the flag) jump on the long pipe and break the brick above it and go through the end and you can see the pipe going to the World 5.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]While playing, pause the game, hold Up, B &amp; A on controller 2 and unpause.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]Method 1:[CR]Use any character and run right toward an enemy at full speed. Just a split second before you think you're about to get hit, jump! With good timing you'll be able to jump yet again in midair! [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]Method 2:[CR]This is yet another way to jump in midair. Stand on the ground while you have 3 or 4 life units and let an enemy run right into you. You'll lose a life unit, but you'll be able to jump in mid-air.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]This is most easily performed in World 1-1. Grab a POW block, and carry it to the set of logs. Wait for a log to bog over the waterfall, then throw the POW block so that it hits solid ground. For some odd reason, this will cause the log to fly high into the air. Strange, eh?[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]Go to world 1-3 and find a potion. Now find the vase next to the brick building all the way to the right side of the level. Drop the potion and go into Sub-Space and then warp into the vase (stand on top of it and press down) You will warp to World 4![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]Go to world 3-1 and go through the door to the large waterfall with all the clouds. Now jump down and land on the platform in the center and enter. Take the potion and drop it near the vase. Enter Sub-space and warp through the vase (press down on the vase) You will warp to World 5![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]Go to world 4-2 and get the potion. Now find the vase and put the sub-space door next to it (drop it from atop the vase) Now enter sub-space and warp. You now warped to World 6[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]Go to world 5-3 and get the potion (make sure you can squat-jump to the vase, you need to get someone with a good jumping ability or use an enemy to give you a boost.) [CR]Put the sub space door near the vase and enter sub space and warp into the vase. You are now in world 7![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]When fighting Bowser in the final level of the game, his lower half will not do damage to you. That means you can avoid damage from his ground-pound attack by ducking if you have obtained a power-up at some point, or, if Small Mario, you can walk under him and through him without sustaining damage![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]In the game, you need to wait until the N-Spade card game - which appears with every 80,000 points you earn - spawns and moves to the spot of a fortress on the overworld map. If you go there now and play it, the fortress will as if you had beaten it afterwards, being collapsed and unplayable. Note, however, that the bridges and locks affected by defeating the fortress normally will still not unlock or reappear, so only do this when these things are not required.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]In World 3-4, about halfway through the level, you'll slide down a long hill to get on another long hill which has some Koopas on it. Take one of their shells further to the right. As the Lakitu appears above, return back to the left. There are two ? Blocks, with a pipe and some bricks between them and wood blocks on the ground. Let the Koopa shell begin bouncing between the wooden blocks and on-screen. The Lakitu's Spinies will almost always launch or crawl down to be killed by the shell; the shell will subsequently rack up more points and lives as time goes on and more Spinies are added.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]When you come across a Kuribo's Shoe, make sure that you have a Tanooki Suit equipped. Just before you jump into the Shoe, transform into a statue. Mario will turn gray and enemies will be unable to touch him.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]In this game, when you normally jump on enemies in sequence without touching the ground, the points you earn will increase from 100, to 200, to 400, to 800, to 1,000, netting a 1-Up on the sixth sequential jump and all those after. However, if your fifth (the one after 800 points) jump lands on either a Lakitu or Boomerang Bro., you'll begin getting 1-Ups right then! This glitch was fixed in Super Mario All-Stars.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]At the start of World 7-1, there is a doorway you're meant to go through. Instead of doing that, run at it and jump at its top-right corner. If done with ample acceleration (and sometimes crouching just before jumping - that can help) you can glitch into the wall and skip the majority of the level.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]Whenever you find a white block (such as the one in 1-3 that leads to the Whistle), stand on it and hold Down until you go through it. Then enter a pipe. In most cases, once on the other side, you'll be unable to be hurt by enemies for the remainder of the level (although sometimes also invisible).[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]In World 3's first fortress (just after 3-3), there are several doors you're meant to go through in the level, guessing which is the correct one. If you enter a door and it's wrong, you can immediately press Up before falling to go back through the door. Further, doing this on the third and fourth doors will warp you, instead of to the gray pipe like the other doors, straight to the boss room.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]Complete the game and watch the ending. Now start a new game. You got 28 P-Wings! [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]Note, however, that this will not work on the Japanese versions of the game, where you simply stay at the ending screen until you turn off the console.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]In Bowsers castle at the end of the game, it is possible to make it so he DOES NOT SPIT FIRE AT YOU.  This trick is easy and only requires getting to world 8 with a P-wing.  First off, use your P-wing on the map before entering the Final Castle.  YOU MUST GET TO BOWSER INTACT.  If you get to the Bowser fight room and the Bricks that he smashes through are not flush with the rest of the floor, then you are in the wrong room.  Now, when you reach Bowsers room, FLY straight up and to the left.  You will be able to walk on a wall above the screen.  Drop down on the other side. You will be in another room to Fight Bowser in.  When you drop, you will be on a door that opens to the princess.  Ignore this room and DO NOT GO TOO FAR TO THE LEFT.  If you do, you will have to fight Bowser and he will still have his Fire Balls. Fly back over the wall to the first room you were in and start the Bowser fight.  He will still throw his head back and make the sound of spitting fire, but nothing will come out.   ;)[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]Get to World 1-2 as Raccoon Mario, with the tail. Climb the hill at the beginning and jump over the horizontal pipe. Stand there for a bit and a whole bunch of Goombas will start walking out of the pipe. Wait for 2-3 of them to come out of the pipe, then jump ontop of one and HOLD A to fly high into the air. Now that you are in the air, use your tail to slowly glide down from the air. On you landing, be sure to land on a second Goomba. Repeat this process for as long as you can. Eventually, the points you get for hitting each Goomba will turn into extra lives. This can be done for as long as you desire to do so. [CR]This can also be done in 2-Fortress, and 7-5, but it is most notably done in 1-2. [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]To ''hide'' behind scenery, simply hold down for a couple seconds while standing on a white block. Then your player can ''hide'' behind scenery for about thirty seconds.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]To turn a wandering hammer brother (the ones that walk about on the world map) into a white ship full of coins, collect a number of coins that is a multiple of 11.  Make the tens digit in your score match the multiple of 11.  Stop the timer at the end of the stage that you are playing in on an even number.  [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]One combination would be:  11 coins, 9,310 as your score, and the timer at 104.  This only works in worlds 1, 3, 5, and 6.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]Get through an airship and defeat the boss as a frog, Hammer Mario, or Tannooki, and you'll receive a letter from the King that reads a little differently.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]To get the N-Spade card game to appear on the World Map. You must do gain 80,000 points as one player, and successfully beat the stage that you broke the 80,000 points with. [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]You could just use the warp whistle at level 7... [CR]If you want to go straight to level 8, you must use a Warp Whistle to proceed to the Warp Zone, then use another warp whistle IN THE WARP ZONE. You will be transported to the level 8 pipe at the bottom of the screen.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]These secret items will allow you to warp. Here are their locations. [CR][B]Level 1-3[/B] [CR]Find the white block near the end and crouch on to of it for 5 seconds. Then proceed to the goal, and go behind it. You will find a Mushroom house with a Whistle. [CR][B]Level 1 Fortress[/B] [CR]Fly over the top of the level when you find the first door with your raccoon powers, and find a hidden door at the far right on the ceiling. It leads to a warp whistle [CR][B]Level 2 Hammer Brother[/B] [CR]Get the Hammer from one of the Hammer Brothers here and use it to destroy the rock at the upper right corner of the Level 2 Map. Then engage the hammer brother on the other side. You should get a chest with a Warp Whistle.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]If you get enough coins in a certain course, you can get a White Mushroom House! [CR]A White Mushroom House in worlds 1,3,5,7 have P Wings [CR]A White Mushroom House in worlds 2,4,6 have Anchors [CR]Levels and required coins: [CR]1-4 (44 coins) [CR]2-2 (30 coins) [CR]3-8 (42? coins) [CR]4-2 (22 coins) [CR]5-5 (28 coins) [CR]6-7 (78 coins) [CR]7-2 (42? coins)[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]In 8-4, as you approach the end, you'll cross a pit of lava guarded by two Parakoopas before entering a pipe. This pipe leads to a flat area (except for a dip and a pipe). Past said dip and pipe, you'll find the first Bowser, a fake one that is nonetheless difficult to beat because you cannot instantly kill him with the axe like normal - you must either dodge him, or kill him with Fire Flower fireballs. If you cannot (or do not want to), approach the gap just after the pipe while dashing at full speed - do not jump over the gap. You will run into the wall by doing so. Hold Right on the D-Pad for a while until the first fake Bowser is on-screen (you do so because the camera will not scroll otherwise). When he is about one-third of the way across the screen, you can then just hold Down and you'll automatically scroll past him, still stuck in the wall, although the camera is not scrolling. Once past him, you are free to continue on - you are not required to defeat this Bowser.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]In World 1-1, go right until you see a Red Koopa boxed in by some bricks. Hit the second brick on the bottom and obtain the Mushroom from it. Then break the third brick and either the leftmost or rightmost one, trapping the Red Koopa on a single brick. You can then stomp on it, and then on its shell like in the original Super Mario Bros.'s infinite-lives trick, infinitely bouncing it back on the wall before you can touch the ground.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]This glitch only works in the castle levels where you fight Bowser at the end - for example, World 1-4, 2-4, 3-4, and so on. It is best to defeat Bowser with Fire Mario or Fire Luigi beforehand, as you must wait out most of the timer to execute this glitch. At the end of the castle levels, there is an axe which you must touch to end the level. If you time your jump correctly (a full jump as the timer goes from 002 to 001 often works) and land on the axe while the timer reads "000", you'll continue as normal to the usual sequence at the end of the castle. However, your timer bonus (50 points per second remaining) will be calculated as if you had 999 seconds, not zero, left on the clock. This allows for an easy 49,950 point boost! Note that this glitch, if executed on levels using a flagpole, will prevent you from earning the bonus in that level.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]Before you touch the flag at the end of a level, make sure your coin total is a multiple of 11. (00,11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88 or 99). Touch the flag when the last digit of your remaining time is the same digit as your coin total and you'll receive a 1-Up.[CR](For example, 55 coins and 275 time left, or 11 coins and 081 time left) [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]To warp back to World 1, you must be in World 3-1. Near the end of the stage, jump onto the spring and fly over the flagpole. When you land, run forwards, and you'll find the warp pipe that takes you back to World 1.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]When you're in World 1-2, jump onto the bricks at the top. Run forwards, and you'll go past the pipe to exit the stage. Keep running, and soon enough, you'll find the warp pipe that takes you to World 2.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]To warp to world 3, you must be in World 1-2. When you reach an area where there is a pipe, a few bricks, and a Steel-Shelled Koopa, hit the first brick on the left. A beanstalk will pop out. Climb up the beanstalk, and at the top, run forwards until you reach the warp pipe that takes you to World 3.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]To Warp to World 4 you must be in World 1-2.  When you get to the moving platforms jump onto the platform.  While on the platform get a running start then jump to the to the small brick ceiling then jump again to the next brick ceiling.  Keep going until you see 2 pipes.  Go down the pipe that's on the far left.  You will be led to a secret area with lava.  Make sure that Mario or Luigi is small.  Run under the small lava pit that's positioned under a brick wall.  After you make it under the lava pit keep going until you see a pipe.  Don't go down the pipe.  Instead, search for a secret coin block that's located one space to the left of the lava pit.  Then get on the coin block and look for a coin block that's  located one space to the right of the coin block that you are on.  Jump on next coin block and jump up to brick wall ceiling.  You should find a Warp Zone that leads to World 4. [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]To Warp to World 5 you must be in World 8-1.  After you pass the 3rd Hammer Bro go down the next pipe you see that points upwards.  You will be led to a secret water area.  Collect the coins and exit.  When you exit you will end up outside.  Go up the stairs and you will see a pipe that leads you back to World 5.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]You must be at least Super Mario to do this. Near the end of World 5-1, when you see two rows of floating bricks past two Red Paratroopas, hit the rightmost brick of the top row to release a vine. Smash the brick next to it, and then climb the vine. After going through the small bonus area, you will be dropped off on a pipe right next to a Warp Zone that takes you to World Six.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]Near the end of world 5-2, when you encounter the trio of tiny elevators, try to go as high as you can, so you can jump off the last elevator and reach the top of the ceiling. Continue to run right, making sure to jump when the ceiling ends, and you will eventually reach the Warp Zone for World 7.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]In World A-2, about halfway through the underground part of the level, you'll find a set of staircase-like blocks. You can break through the blocks above them and get on the upper portion of the area. From there, you can run and jump heading right and past the warp pipe heading outside - this takes you to a World B warp zone.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]When you are in World A-3, use the spring to get over the flagpole at the end of the stage. From there, run forwards until you reach a pipe. It takes you to World C.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]In World B-4, go to the very last pipe in the level (it's next to a lava pit). Jump in the pipe and you will be taken to a Warp Zone area that will lead to World D.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]In world 5-2, when you reach the three elevators, hop on the first one and use it to hit the brick immediately left of the elevator. Climb the vine that sprouts from the brick and travel through the small bonus area to reach the Warp Zone that'll take you to World 8.</plot>

			<plot>Mario returns in this incredible new role-playing adventure! His latest rival is Smithy, a menacing creature who causes fear and treachery in the Mushroom Kingdom. Mario must recover seven stars and repair the Star Road before he can make his way to Bowser's castle for a final confrontation with Smithy. Powerful weapons, sinister spells and other useful items help Mario to complete his harrowing journey. New friends and old allies support him along the way. Even Bowser lends a hand![CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hidden command[CR]Notice: this only works in the SFC/Japanese version.[CR]Open the menu screen (by pressing X), then press Down, Up, Right, Left, Select, Start, Select, Start, B.

But the level up has to occur using an invincibility star.  When you jump to open the chest with the star, press the menu button to open the menu mid jump.  In the menu switch the character you want to learn the spell with the character that is going to level up.  Kill enemies until that character levels up.  After the invincibility wears off and the level up process finishes the the spell they learned during the level up will be given to the character that you moved into their previous position.The glitch occurs because the game is confused and thinks the character that leveled up is still in the old party slot, so it adds the spell to the magic list of the character currently in that slot.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] 2D Mario from Super Mario Bros. 1[CR]One time only in the game you can change into a 2D Mario walking around on a 3D landscape.

Go to the bottom right side of the screen to the exit. Hit the box next to the door and get a few coins (but do not empty it, leave some in) then go through the exit. As soon as you go through the exit, go back through and hit the box more times (still don't empty it).

The one in Mushroom castle, however, has only 1 oppurtunity, and that is at the beginning of the game. On your first visit to the castle, be sure to jump on Toad's head and ride him to where the door is. You can now jump onto the ledge right above the door and find a Treasure box that can't be found at any other point in the game.</plot>

			<title_clean>Super Metroid</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Title screen featuring the Metroid Hatchling[CR]Super Metroid is an action-adventure game developed by Nintendo R&amp;D1 and published by Nintendo. It was initially released on the Super Famicom (Super Nintendo) in 1994, but has since then been re-released on the Nintendo Wii's Virtual Console. It is the third game in the Metroid franchise, and the plot picks up where the last game in the series, Metroid II: Return of Samus, left off.[CR]Like most games of the series, Super Metroid is an 2D action-adventure game with platforming elements. Players take the role of a female bounty hunter known as Samus Aran as she explores the deadly planet Zebes and collect an arsenal of weapons and gadgets, which will in turn let her progress into areas that were previously inaccessible.[CR]Super Metroid was one of the largest and most graphically-impressive games for the console at the time of its release. Even today, the game is considered by many to be one of the greatest games of all time.[CR]Super Metroid is also famous for the unintentional ability to "sequence break" the game. This means that although there is roughly a set path for Samus to follow, skilled players are capable of reaching ledges or getting past barriers before they have discovered the power up that is ordinarily required to get there. For example, by mastering a maneuver known as the 'mockball' players can get the super missiles very early in the game, when they enter Brinstar for the first time. This curious mechanic has many people struggling to see who can find the fastest path to take to complete the game, making Super Metroid one of the first games surrounded by the 'speedrun' phenomenon.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The famous line[CR]Super Metroid opens with a short summary of its predecessor, Metroid II: Return of Samus on the Nintendo Game Boy. After she eradicated the Metroids from their homeworld, SR-388, Samus Aran finds a Metroid hatchling, which believed her to be its mother. Unable to end its life, Samus brings the Metroid larvae to the Ceres Space Colony, so that scientists could study the mysterious power of the Metroids.[CR]However, just as she leaves, Samus receives a distress signal coming from Ceres. She immediately returns, only to find everyone dead. After a short treck through the Colony Samus encounters her nemesis, Ridley. They have a short battle which ends with Ridley taking the Metroid Hatchling into his possession. She then escapes the space colony as it self-destructs and tracks Ridley to a nearby planet, Zebes.[CR]Upon landing on the planet, Samus arrives in Crateria and shortly after arriving finds the morph ball and missiles power ups. Afterwards she collects the morph ball bombs and, before she can exit the room, she is attacked by a Torizo which she defeats. She takes these power ups with her into Brinstar. While in Brinstar she fights the sub-boss Spore Spawn in order to receive super missiles. After visiting Upper Norfair to obtain the Hi-Jump Boots, Samus travels to Kraid's Lair in order to obtain the Varia Suit. After defeating Kraid, Samus receives the Varia Suit allowing her to travel deeper into Norfair.[CR]While exploring Norfair Samus finds serveral more power-ups including the Grapple Beam and she defeats the sub-boss Crocomire. After exploring Norfair, Samus uses the Grapple Beam to gain access to the Wrecked Ship. When she arrives the power is off and the place is deserted except for ghosts. Eventually she arrives in a room and the boss Phantoon appears. After defeating Phantoon, power returns to the ship allowing Samus to fully explore it. While exploring the ship she finds the Gravity Suit which will allow her to freely travel through water.[CR]Samus then returns to Brinstar and uses a power bomb to break the glass tube separating Brinstar from Maridia. With the Gravity Suit equipped Samus is able to explore the flooded Maridia fully. While in Maridia she defeats the sub-boss Botwoon and the boss Draygon. Upon defeating Draygon Samus receives the Space Jump ability which will allow her access into Lower Norfair where Ridley resides.[CR]Shortly after entering lowering Norfair, Samus enters a battle with a Golden Torizo which is much more powerful than the previous Torizo she battled. After defeating it she receives her final power-up, the Screw Attack. After further traveling through Lower Norfair she eventually reaches Ridley's hideout. After defeating Ridley she enters the next room but finds that the Metroid Hatchling is not there.[CR]After this she returns to Crateria and enters the room with the four golden statues of the bosses. The gems of the bosses break and the statues collapse granting Samus entrance into the Space Pirates base, Tourian. While traveling through Tourian, Samus reaches an area where the Metroid Hatchling (now fully grown) comes out of nowhere and attacks an enemy. After killing the enemy it proceeds to attack Samus draining all of here energy tanks and leaving her with just one blip of energy.[CR]After recovering at a nearby energy machine, Samus eventually confronts Mother Brain who resides in her signature glass tube. Once Samus does enough damage to Mother Brain the tube collapses and Mother Brain reveals her true form. Halfway through the battle Mother Brain begins to drain all of Samus' energy using a beam attack. Before Mother Brain can unleash the killing blow the Metroid Hatchling appears and attacks her. While Mother Brain is stunned from the attacked the Hatchling begins to regenerates Samus' energy. However, Mother Brain recovers from her stunned state and begins to attack the Hatchling while it is in the process of helping Samus. Mother Brain deals a final blow to the Hatchling killing it, but right before it dies it uses the last bit of its strength to give Samus the power of the Phazon Beam which Samus uses to easily finish off Mother Brain.[CR]After Mother Brain is defeated a self-destruct sequence is activated and Samus has 3 minutes to get out of Tourian and escape planet Zebes before it explodes. While on her way to her ship she stops to save the animals that helped her earlier in the game. Once she reaches her ship she takes off and while she is flying away Zebes is seen exploding in the background.[CR]Power Ups[CR]Samus' suit can be augmented with a number of power ups that grant her new powers and abilities. Each element can be configured on or off in the suit equipment menu. There are a great deal of power ups to collect scattered throughout Zebes and each one that is collected, along with map squares discovered, increases the completion percentage which is displayed at the end of the game.MiscellaneousPower UpDescriptionEnergy TankEnergy tanks increase Samus' maximum energy by 100 points. There are a total of 14 energy tanks hidden throughout the game giving Samus a maximum of 1399 energy points (14 tanks plus the initial 99 energy points Samus starts the game with).MissilesMissiles can be used to defeat enemies and open red doors, it takes 5 missiles to open a red door. Each missile tank collected by Samus increases her carrying capacity by 5 and their are a total of 46 missile tanks hidden throughout the game for a maximum of 230 missiles.Super MissileSuper missiles are upgraded missiles that are more powerful than standard missiles, but have a slow rate of fire. They can also be used to open green and red doors and it only takes 1 super missile to open either type of door. Each super missile tank collected by Samus increases her carrying capacity by 5 and their are a total of 10 super missile tanks hidden throughout the game for a maximum of 50 super missiles.Power BombPower bombs are special bombs that, when laid, create a huge explosion that destroys or greatly damages nearby enemies, and they also have the ability to open yellow doors. Each power bomb tank collected by Samus increases her carrying capacity by 5 and their are a total of 10 power bomb tanks hidden throughout the game for a maximum of 50 power bombs.Reserve TankReserve tanks are a rare item that allow Samus to collect extra energy in reserve, each reserve tank can hold 100 energy. When Samus is at max energy, extra energy collected will go to the reserve tanks. If Samus loses all her energy but has energy in her reserve tanks, instead of dieing the reserve tanks will be automatically used giving Samus a second chance. The reserve tanks can also be used manually if the player doesn't want to wait till their energy reaches zero to use them. There are only 4 reserve tanks hidden throughout the game.SuitsSuitDescriptionVaria SuitThe Varia Suit gives Samus the ability to travel through the super heated areas of Norfair without being damaged. In addition, it also reduces the damage received by Samus. It is received after defeating Kraid in his lair.Gravity SuitThe Gravity Suit gives Samus the ability to travel freely through water-filled areas. It also further reduces the damage received by Samus. It is found in the Wrecked Ship after defeating Phantoon.BeamsBeamDescriptionCharge BeamThe Charge Beam is the first beam upgrade Samus receives. It allows Samus to charge up her arm cannon to create a powerful charge shot. It is found in Brinstar early on in the game. It can be used with all other beam upgrades except for the hyper beam.Spazer BeamThe Spazer Beam increases the power of Samus' beam and splits it into three horizontal shots giving it a much larger hit box. It can also be combined with the Wave Beam and Ice Beam. The Spazer Beam can be found deep inside Brinstar.Ice BeamThe Ice Beam increases the strength of Samus' beam and gives her the ability to freeze enemies in their tracks, allowing her to use her enemies as platforms. It can be combined with the Spazer Beam and Wave Beam, and it is located in Upper Norfair.Wave BeamThe Wave Beam has the ability to shoot through walls, allowing Samus to access areas that have a switch on the opposite side of a gate. It also increases the power of her beam and can be combined with the Spazer Beam and Ice Beam. It is found in Upper Norfair after collecting the grapple beam. However, it can easily be collected without the grapple beam by wall jumping.Plasma BeamThe Plasma Beam is the second most powerful beam in the game, it produces two horizontal beams when fired. While it has a smaller hit box than the Spazer Beam, it is much more powerful. It can also be combined with the Ice Beam and Wave Beam. It is found in Maridia after Draygon has been defeated.Grapple BeamWhile the Grapple Beam can be used to defeat enemies, its main purpose is to give Samus the ability to grapple onto grapple blocks and swing on them to pass over gaps or to aid in climbing up the side of a wall. It is found in Upper Norfair.Hyper BeamThe Hyper Beam is the final beam received in the game and is the most powerful beam. It fires a single beam of incredible power, capable of destroying normal enemies with a single hit. It is received in the middle of the final boss fight with Mother Brain. After the Metroid Hatchling is killed by Mother Brain, it gives Samus the Hyper Beam before dying.Murder BeamThe Murder Beam is an unofficial beam that can be obtained via a glitch in the game. It is obtained by equipping all five beams at once (usually the Plasma Beam and Spazer Beam can not be equipped together). In order to equip all five beams the player must first charge their beam, while the beam is charged they should go into the menu and equip all five beams. When fired, the Murder Beam produces an invisible wall of broken pixels rather than a sprite and the color is random. It is usually used during the Mother Brain fight as it is capable of killing her very quickly. Another interesting note is that the beam can only be fired to the left, if fired to the right the game will crash.Space/Time BeamThe Space/Time Beam is another unofficial beam that can be obtained using a glitch. Instead of equipping all five beams at once, equipping the Spazer Beam, Plasma Beam, and Ice Beam together will produce the Space/Time Beam (Charge Beam can also be equipped though it is optional). The beam causes heavy lag and is registered as morph ball bomb damage when shot at enemies. The beam is best known for its ability to permanently corrupt the game, make strange alterations to the graphics, and produce several glitches such as resetting item pick-ups.AbilitiesAbilityDescriptionMorph BallThe Morph Ball gives Samus the ability to curl up into a ball in order to roll through small spaces. It is found in Crateria towards the beginning of the game.Morph Ball BombsThe Morph Ball Bombs give Samus the ability to lay bombs while in morph ball mode. While the bombs can be used to damage enemies, they are mostly used to bomb jump up to higher platforms while in morph ball mode. It is also possible to bomb jump infinitely, however this technique is very hard to do and is usually only used by expert speedrunners. The Morph Ball Bombs are found shortly after the morph ball in Crateria.Hi-Jump BootsThe Hi-Jump Boots increase the height of Samus' jump, allowing her to reach platforms that were previously unreachable. The Hi-Jump Boots are found shortly after entering Upper Norfair.Speed BoosterThe Speed Booster give Samus the ability to run incredible speeds destroying enemies and speed booster blocks in her path. The Speed Booser has a charge up time requiring to dash for a short amount of time before the speed booster kicks in. This charge up time can be shortened using the "short charge" technique. This technique allows speedrunners to sequence break past certain areas of the game. For example, this technique allows players to reach the wrecked ship without the grapple beam. The Speed Booster is found in Upper Norfair after defeating Kraid to obtain the Varia Suit.X-Ray VisorThe X-Ray Visor can be used by Samus to view breakable blocks. It is widely consider to be an unnecessary item because morph ball bombs can be used to reveal breakable blocks and players can often figure out what blocks are breakable by hints in the graphics. The X-Ray Visor can by found in Brinstar after collecting the grapple beam. However, it can also be collected without collecting the grapple beam, by strategically freezing enemies with the ice beam and using them as platforms.Space JumpThe Space Jump allows Samus to infinitely spin jump in the air giving her the ability to reach any height. The Space Jump can be found in Maridia right after defeating Draygon.Spring BallThe Spring Ball gives Samus the ability to jump while in morph ball form negating the need to use bomb jumping. The power up is useful for players who struggle with bomb jumping, but rather useless to masters of bomb jumping. The Spring Ball can be found in Maridia.Screw AttackThe Screw Attack is the final power up found in Super Metroid. It adds a lighting attack to Samus' space jump destroying any enemy that comes in contact with it and also destroying breakable blocks. It is found in Lower Norfair after defeating the Golden Torizo.[CR]Locations[CR]LocationDescriptionCeres Space ColonySuper Metroid begins when Samus receives a distress signal from this research station shortly after delivering the Metroid hatchling to the scientists there. Her visit is brief as her nemesis Ridley sets off the self-destruct sequence as she exits with the metroid hatchling in hand.Planet ZebesThe majority of the game takes place on Zebes, the same planet Samus visited in the original Metroid title, as well as her former home when she was being raised and trained by the Chozo. Zebes contains a variety of environments that Samus explores as she tracks down the stolen Metroid hatchling.CrateriaCrateria is the area Samus lands in when she arrives on Zebes. Not much time is spent here, as it is more of a route to the deeper locales Samus explores. The atmosphere here is dreary and ominously quiet for the duration of her visit, either raining or cloudy most of the time. Crateria also houses the ruins of Mother Brain's original hideout, Tourian, which self-destructed at the end of Samus first mission to Zebes. Samus finds the Morph Ball Bombs here.BrinstarThe starting point of the original Metroid title, Brinstar houses 5 unique environments: a blue-hued environment where the Morph Ball is obtained; a lush, green, jungle-like environment; a pink, plant-filled environment where the Charge Beam resides; an area consisting of red-colored soil where Samus finds the Spazer Beam and X-Ray Scope; and a combination of green plants and metallic structures where Samus battles the gigantic reptilian-like creature Kraid in his lair to obtain the Varia Suit.NorfairThe fiery Norfair leads Samus the areas closest to the planet's core, which include caves composed of what seems like cooled igneous rock, deeper caves filled with treacherous lava pits, a small area filled with hardened green bubbles of some sort, and ancient Chozo Ruins that Ridley has claimed as his hideout. Samus can find many power-ups here, such as the Hi-Jump Boots, Speed Booster, Ice Beam, Grapple Beam, Wave Beam, and Screw Attack.Wrecked ShipThe Wrecked Ship consists of the haunted ruins of a crashed space vessel (presumably the destroyed Space Pirate mother ship from the conclusion of Metroid: Zero Mission). Samus must defeat the powerful ghost Phantoon here to restore power to the ship and obtain the Gravity Suit.MaridiaThe eerie aquatic environment of planet Zebes, Maridia, is filled with a number of marine-based areas such as water-filled chasms; damp, sand-filled rooms and a flooded metallic area presided over by intimidating crustacean, Draygon. Samus finds the Space Jump, Spring Ball, and Plasma Beam power ups here.TourianAfter conquering every dangerous corner of planet Zebes, Samus comes to find out that the Mother Brain's base of operations, Tourian, has been relocated and rebuilt and is once again filled with the energy-siphoning Metroids. If Samus can trek through the deathly corridors and defeat Mother Brain once and for all, she can finally bring closure to her once beloved home of Planet Zebes that the greedy Space Pirates invaded so long ago.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Super Metroid has received universal acclaim from critics. On Gamerankings the game holds an average review score of 95.79%, making it the highest rated SNES game on the site.Accolades[CR]Super Metroid has been featured in several "best of" lists. Some of these are as follows:PublicationAccoladeRankIGNTop 100 Games of All Time (2003, 2005, 2006, 2007)3,10,5,7Game InformerTop 100 Games of All Time (2001)29Game InformerTop 200 Games of All Time (2009)21Electronic Gaming MonthlyTop 100 Games of All Time (1997)6Nintendo Power100 Best Games of All Time (1997)6Nintendo PowerTop 200 Games (2006)12ScrewattackTop 20 SNES Games (2010)1GameProThe 30 Greatest 16-Bit Games (2009)7GamesRadarThe 100 Best Games of All Time (2011)9[CR]Speedrunning[CR]Shinesparking is an important technique in speedrunning[CR]Super Metroid is one of the most heavily contested speedrunning games of all time and is considered one of the pioneer games of the speedrunning phenomenon. Various techniques such as the mock ball have been used to sequence break past large sections of the game and these techniques are vital in speedruns of the game. There are many opportunities to sequence break and many techniques that can be used to travel through the game at a much faster rate (i.e. shinesparking and spike jumping), because of this the game is speedran often and in many different ways. Speedruns can be run for 100% item completion, low% completion, any% completion, or for certain challenge runs such as beating the bosses in reverse order which requires very advanced techniques to complete.[CR]Tool assisted speed runs are often much faster than there non-tool assisted equivalents. For example, currently the fastest non-tool assisted any% speedrun of the game is 44 minutes 54 seconds real time set on September 27, 2013 by Kottpower. The fastest any% tool assisted time is 38 minutes 41 seconds real time set on October 25, 2009 by Taco &amp; Kriole, nearly 8 minutes faster than the non-tool assisted run. The reason for the big time difference is because in a tool assisted run the runner plays the game one frame at a time and uses save states in order to create the perfect run. The runner also uses techniques that aren't humanly possible without playing the game at extremely slow speeds to save a lot of time. However, because the game is so popular in the speedrunning world, new ways to save time are being discovered which causes world record times to be broken.

Some are exploited in speedruns in order to sequence break past areas of the game. However, only a small number of the glitches are actually used in speedruns and the majority of them are graphical glitches that are not useful to speedrunners. In addition, there are a small number of glitches that can freeze the game or permanently destroy the games SRAM ruining the cart. However, these type of glitches are very rare and almost impossible to perform on accident. Here are some of the more useful glitches used by speedrunners:[CR]Mockball - The Mockball glitch allows Samus to retain her running speed while in morph ball form. This glitch can be used to get super missiles without having to face Spore Spawn which saves a lot of time.[CR]Quick-charge - The quick-charge glitch allows Samus to charge up her shinespark over a much shorter distance. The glitch is useful in several areas as shinesparking allows the player to quickly dash through rooms, but it most notably allows the player to enter the Wrecked Ship without collecting the Grapple Beam.Stand-up glitch, Samus attacking Mother Brain during scripted event[CR]Stand-up glitch - The stand-up glitch allows Samus to "stand up" in the Mother Brain fight during the scripted scene where the Metroid Hatchling attacks Mother Brain, heals Samus while being attacked by Mother Brain, and then gives Samus the Hyper Beam after it is killed by Mother Brain. Usually Samus in incapacitated during this entire scene, but this glitch allows Samus to move around and attack Mother Brain during the scene allowing for a much quicker fight.[CR]X-Ray Climb - The X-Ray Climb glitch allows Samus to get stuck in walls and travel outside of rooms without using doors. This glitch can be used to enter Tourian without defeating any bosses, and obtaining a 6% completion percentage which is the lowest possible completion percentage.[CR]ROM Hacks[CR]Super Metroid is also frequently hacked primarily by using a program called SMILE (Super Metroid Integrated Level Editor). This allows fans of the game to change the games layout however they want whether they want to make small changes or completely change the layout. It also allows them to make graphical changes to give the game a fresh new look. These hacks are not commercial products, they are created and shared among fans of the game for free. They are, however, a big part of why the game still has a large player base almost 17 years after its original release. These hacks give players new ways to experience the game by providing different layouts to explore and, in some hacks, new graphics.[CR]Many ROM hacks have been created by fans with the help of SMILE and there is a popular forum dedicated to Metroid hacks called Metroid Construction. At Metroid Construction users can share their created hacks with other members, provide feedback on certain hacks, ask hacking questions, and many other things. Here are some examples of notable Super Metroid hacks: Super Metroid: RedesignMap of Super Metroid: Redesign showing its enormous size[CR]Super Metroid: Redesign is a massive ROM Hack created by Drewseph which, as the name would suggest, completely redesigns the game. The layout is all new and more than twice the size of the original. In addition to this, changes have been made to the physics so that Samus falls to the ground quicker after jumping and new items have been added. A new goal has also been added, Samus has to disable 12 Chozo Guardians, which are hidden throughout the game, in order to enter Tourian.[CR]For the development of Super Metroid: Redesign, Drewseph was the project leader and level designer. Kejardon was the main programmer with additional programming coming from Jathys, Jman2050, and MathOnNapkins. The hack was released on June 1, 2006.[CR] Super Metroid ImpossibleSpikes were added to make this boss fight harder.[CR]Super Metroid Impossible is a ROM Hack created by Saturn. While it doesn't deviate from the original layout that much, the small changes made are made to make the game incredibly hard to the point where it is almost impossible to complete without the help of save states and slow down. Expert techniques and challenges are required to the beat the game. For example, the infinite bomb jumping technique as well as traveling to and beating Ridley without the Varia Suit, which is usually only done in challenge runs of the original game, are required in order to complete the game.[CR] Super Metroid ErisEris features brand new graphics[CR]Super Metroid Eris is a ROM Hack created by Digital Mantra. The graphics in this hack are a complete overhaul and are the game's biggest feature. The layout is also completely changed along with the plot. The premise to the plot is that the Galactic Federation has lost contact to Eris Station and Samus Aran has been dispatched to find out what's wrong. It is also notable to mention that Mother Brain is not featured in this game, instead a re-skinned Phantoon is the final boss. In addition, during the ending self-destruct sequence, there is an opportunity for Samus to save a child rather than the animals in the original.[CR] Super Metroid: AegisAegis, like Eris, features dramatic graphical changes[CR]Super Metroid Aegis is a ROM Hack currently in development by Acheron. It is similar to Eris in that the graphics are all new as is the layout. In addition to all the classic powerups, new powerups will also be available such as the boost ball. The game will have five different areas: Glacia (frozen area), Terrenus (mountain area), Radia (desert area), Subverda (Chozo Ruins), G.F.S Aegis (City/Sewer area) and the final boss area which has yet to be revealed. The game has been in development for around 4 years, Acheron stated in August 2010 that the game was almost complete but he has been very busy and the game would be done when its done.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Super Metroid "Sound in Action"[CR]The soundtrack to Super Metroid was composed by Minako Hamano and Kenji Yamamoto. It was released in a compilation Super Metroid &#8220;Sound in Action&#8221; which included music from Metroid, Super Metroid as well as orchestral and synthesized arrangements of selected tracks. It was published by Sony Records and released in Japan on June 22, 1995.[CR]Super Metroid &#8220;Sound in Action&#8221;Theme of SUPER METROID (Arrange Version)Crateria - Space Pirates Appear (Arrange Version)Space Warrior - Samus Aran's Theme (Arrange Version)SUPER METROID Ending (Arrange Version)METROID Ending (Arrange Version)TitleAppearance Fanfare~BrinstarNorfair AreaRidley's ChamberKraid's ChamberTourianZebetiteEscapeEndingOpening (Destroyed Science Academy Research Station)Theme of SUPER METROIDPlanet Zebes - Crateria ArrivalCrateria - Space Pirates AppearBrinstar - Plant Overgrowth AreaBrinstar - Red Soil Wetland AreaNorfair - Scorching Lava AreaSpace Warrior - Samus Aran's ThemeWrecked ShipMaridia - Rocky Underground Water AreaMaridia - Quicksand Underground Water AreaNorfair - Ancient Ruins AreaSmall Boss Confrontation BGM (Spore-Spawn, Botwoon)Big Boss Confrontation BGM (Ridley, Draygon)Big Boss Confrontation BGM (Kraid, Crocomire, Phantoon)Samus Aran Appearance FanfareItem Acquisition FanfareSamus Aran's Last CryMysterious Statue ChamberTourianMother BrainEscapePlanet Zebes ExplosionEnding[CR]			[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Charge Hyper Beam[CR]Using this glitch, you can effectively charge and fire a Hyper Beam shot. To execute it, simply hold down the fire button during the final Zebes countdown and make sure the first shot that is fired opens a blue door. Now, before the next shot is fired, head through the door. The charging sound will play and once you exit the door you will fire a large beam shot.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Charge Hyper Beam[CR]This is a glitch that exploits an error in the detection of valid hits in the various green gates scattered across Zebes. [CR]Make sure the gate's tab faces to the left, and you are on its right. Stand some distance, maybe 5-6 tiles or more, from the gate. Hold the run button and right before you reach the gate tap the jump button while simultaneously aiming up and to the left and firing a super missile. With patience and skill you will open the gate from the ''wrong'' side. [CR]Exploit this glitch to obtain the Screw Attack without facing Golden Torizo, or to obtain the Grapple Beam by an alternate path, or even beat the game without shattering the Maridian tube.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Charge Hyper Beam[CR]In Super Metroid, when you get the Gravity Suit, you can move underwater freely. However, there is a trick that you can use to jump higher underwater. First, find a location that is fully submerged in water. Try a room in Maridia or the room before Lower Norfair (the ones with filled with Lava)  Next, hold the jump button. Immediatly after you press it, press pause. Go to the inventory menu and switch off the gravity suit. Hold the jump button and unpause the game. You will jump higher than normal. Use this trick to get the screw attack before the space jump.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Charge Hyper Beam[CR]By equiping all five beams at the game time you can kill Motherbrain pretty easyly. [CR]To equip all five beams at the same time go into the equipment screen in the Sub-Menu. You will notice that the Spazar Beam in unequiped because the Plazma Beam cancels out the Spazar. Equip the Spazar Beam (thus unequiping the Plazma Beam) then move the curser over to one of the Boot Upgrades. Hit Left and the A Button at the same time to equip the Plazma Beam. If you did it right then the letters Var should appear next to the Plazma Beam. [CR]To complete the glitch you must first charge your beam before equiping all five beams. After your beam is charged all the way , equip all five beam the way I decirbed above the fire it at say Motherbrains head (when it's laying on the ground). If you did it right then an orange orb should stay behind and contanly hit Motherbrain. Equip your beams reqularly. [CR]NOTE: This beam can crash your game if not done correctly.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Charge Hyper Beam[CR]First, you need the speed boots and X ray visor.  This is fairly easy to pull off.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Charge Hyper Beam[CR]Switch to the weapon that is before the Visor.  Start holding the boost button while running until you see those silhouettes of Samus.  Now, still holding the boost button, switch to the X ray visor.  You will stop, and you will see those silhouttes in full color, mimicing your every move.  [CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Charge Hyper Beam[CR]Once you let go of the button, the sillhouttes will disapear.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Save the Zebes Critters[CR]When you are escaping during the countdown at the very end of the game, don't go straight to your ship from Crateria's caves. Instead, go to the room where you first acquired the morph ball bombs. Inside should be the critters that helped you escape certain rooms earlier in the game. Once they leave the room, you can exit too from where you entered. Saving them will affect the ending.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Crystal Flash[CR]This allows you to refill your Energy Tanks.  [CR]1. You must have 49 or less energy units. [CR]2. You must have 10 or more missiles, 10 or more Super Missles, and 11 or more Power Bombs. [CR]3. Choose the Power Bomb icon, and morph. [CR]4. Press and hold the L,R, and shot buttons and hold DOWN on the control pad. [CR]You will absorb the blast and refill your energy.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Crystal Flash[CR]In lower Norfair, before you enter the room with the golden Torizo boss, open the door then roll into a ball and hold the four main face buttons (A, B, X, and Y). Enter the door in this state and you will instantly have 700 Energy, 300 Reserve Energy, 100 Missiles, 20 Super Missiles, 20 Power Bombs, and all items except the Screw Attack. This can be done from either entrance.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Crystal Flash[CR]As soon as the boss fight with Draygon begins, note the four turrets firing electricity from the walls - two on either side. Before Draygon even shows up, blast away all four turrets with charge shots. See how the turrets spew out electricity after being killed? Equip the Grapple Beam and get ready to use this to your advantage.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Crystal Flash[CR]Instead of fighting Draygon the normal way, allow him to grab you. While he's swinging you about the room, use the Grapple Beam to latch on to one of the panels on the wall that was once occupied by a turret. The electricity will go through the Grapple Beam, through your suit, and to Draygon himself. Samus will stay locked on until Draygon dies.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Crystal Flash[CR]First, Equip the Charge Beam and ONE other beam ability e.g. ice or wide[CR](NOT two)[CR]Select the power Bombs but do not enter morph ball mode.[CR]Charge your beam up and you should use one of the following secret attacks[CR]Ice- A shield will form around you damaging enemies you touch[CR]Wave-Energy Balls circle you then Fire away from you in various directions[CR]Plasma-Same as wave but with Plasma effect[CR]Spazer- Large beams fire away from you like shrapnel[CR]This will use up one of your Power Bombs[CR](It may not work if you've just finished charging, give it another second)[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Defeating Draygon Easily[CR]It's possible to defeat Draygon with a well-timed combination of a charged Plasma Beam shot and the X-Ray Scope. When the fight starts, charge your shot and aim it at the spot where Draygon first materializes. As soon as your shot connects and Draygon flashes, turn the X-Ray Scope on and off repeatedly. Doing so resets the Plasma Beam's hit counter, which causes it to inflict additional damage each time the X-Ray Scope is activated. Draygon will go down in seconds.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Get spazer and defeat Kraid without Hi-jump boots[CR]Using this trick you can get several collectibles before going into Norfair. To get the spazer, simply shoot the block to where the spazer normally is, and now head to the edge of the little platform. Spin jump into the little hole and wall jump onto the ledge. Repeat until you get to the tunnel. To get into Kraid's lair, simply go onto the ledge beneath the platform closest to the ground and press against the wall. Now run off the ledge and spin jump right before you fall. Now when you hit the side of the ledge leading into the statue's mouth, wall jump. Now in midair, press down twice to morph and hold right to land on the platform. Voila! In the fight with Kraid, just wall jump against the left wall and land on the platform to get up to his head in the second phase. Alternately, you can simply jump onto his spikes.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Momotarou Dentetsu II is the second "Super" game in the long-running Momotarou Dentetsu series and the third overall. It was the first game in the series to be released on the Super Famicom: both Momotarou Dentetsu and Super Momotarou Dentetsu were Famicom games (though the latter was also released on the PC Engine and Game Boy, like Dentetsu II).[CR]The games focus on each player's burgeoning real estate corporation, allowing the players to take turns and move their trains around the board to buy properties and trade resources. It plays similarly to the Parker Brothers board game Monopoly or the Itadaki Street games.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Naxat Open is the spiritual successor to Naxat Open, a golf game that Naxat published and lent their name to. The game uses the standard top-down perspective for golf games from this era.[CR]It is unusual for the inclusion of Naxat's Dorabocchan ("Little Dorabo") character, who had appeared in two games at this point: 1990's Makai Prince Dorabocchan for the PC Engine and 1993's Chou Makai Taisen: Dorabocchan for SNES, best known as The Twisted Tales of Spike McFang in the US. Dorabocchan/Spike's inherent magical talent allows him to beneficially manipulate his game, which appears in the form of magical cards he can play before taking a swing. The player can also choose to play as five other characters from the franchise, as well as a choice of six caddies.[CR]	</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Ninja-Kun is a 1994 Japan-only side-scrolling action game developed and published by Jaleco for the SNES. It is a graphically updated version of UPL's Ninja-kun Arcade games from the 1980s, which Jaleco had previously adapted for consoles (as well as creating their own spin-offs, named Ninja Jajamaru-kun).[CR]As well as featuring 16-bit graphics the game now also features a story mode, bosses, an upgradable health gauge (the Arcade game only allowed Ninja-kun to take a single hit) and multiple weapon types. Ninja-kun can also create a powerful one-off magic blast by collecting the souls of dead enemies as they float off the screen. The game also includes a two-player cooperative mode.[CR]Super Ninja-kun is not to be confused with Super Ninja Boy, another ninja-themed action game for the SNES. </plot>

			<title_clean>Super Professional Baseball II</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Professional Baseball II is a TOSE/Jaleco baseball simulator and the sequel to Super Professional Baseball (Super Bases Loaded). Super Bases Loaded 2 is actually based on a separate Jaleco baseball game named Super 3D Baseball, instead of this game. Super Professional Baseball II was never released in the US or Europe.[CR]Super Professional Baseball II uses the same angled viewpoint as its predecessor while batting/pitching, to ensure both the batter and pitcher are clearly visible. Small animations play whenever a batter reaches a base just as the ball flies in, allowing the player to see clearly whether or not the batter is actually "safe" or "out".[CR]	</plot>

			<title_clean>Super Robot Taisen EX</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Robot Taisen EX is the fourth game released in the Super Robot Taisen series, though is not a true sequel to the 3rd Super Robot Taisen but rather a spin-off. It begins the Masou Kishin storyline, which continues in Super Robot Taisen Gaiden: Masou Kishin - The Lord of Elemental and the Super Robot Taisen OG Saga entries.[CR]Like the rest of the games in the series, Super Robot Taisen EX is a strategy game that takes various characters and mecha from numerous manga/anime franchises, as well as a smattering of original characters. It was originally released for the Super Famicom in 1994 and later saw an enhanced version for the PlayStation in 2000. This version was added to the PSOne Classics range on PSN.[CR]Featured Series[CR]A list of the anime series which are featured in the game. Series that premiered in the Super Robot Wars series in this game are marked with "(new)".Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust MemoryMobile Suit Zeta GundamMobile Suit Gundam ZZMobile Suit Gundam: Char's CounterattackMobile Suit Gundam F91Mazinger ZGreat MazingerUFO Robo GrendizerGetter Robo GDemon God of War Goshogun (new)Aura Battler Dunbine (new)Banpresto Originals (original characters created for the game)Masoukishin - Lord of Elemental (Banpresto original storyline; new)[CR]New Features[CR]Chapters: The game is split into three chapters, each based on one of the originals from SRW 3: Ryuune, Masaki, and Shuu. The player can choose Ryuune's and Masaki's in any order, while Shuu's story is always last.[CR]Interactive Scenarios: After playing one of the aforementioned chapters, the player has the option of carrying the decisions made in that chapter into the next, setting up events that would not happen otherwise. A somewhat similar system is used in the SRW Compact 2 trilogy, in which the player can carry save data containing unlocked characters (among other things) to the next chapter via the Wonderswan's internal memory.[CR]Upgradeable Weapons: Weapons can now be upgraded.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Neo Granzon[CR]Once you've completed Masaki's and Ryuune's route, your save file should have the letters "MR" meaning Masaki and Ryuune. Restart the game and on the Banpresto starting blue screen press "Down, Up, Left, Right, L, R" before the screen fades. It should turn pink and when you start Shuu's route, you will start with Neo Granzon instead of a regular Granzon.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Rugby is a competitive Rugby Union game from TOSE and Tonkin House released in late 1994 for the Super Famicom. Despite featuring an internationally popular sport, the game was never localized or released outside of Japan. It is based on the real-life eponymous Rugby Union league that features teams from South Africa, Australia and New Zealand.[CR]The game depicts the action via a horizontal perspective, and zooms in when the ball is held by a player. When the ball is kicked, the camera zooms out to let the player see the entire pitch. The game includes scrums and all the other rules and features of Rugby Union.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Sokoban (or Soukoban) is a puzzle game in which the player must push crates around a maze to their designated storage area, ensuring they do not accidentally push a crate into a position where it cannot be recovered. Thinking Rabbit created the original game in 1982 on home computers, and Super Sokoban is the first Super Famicom game to follow the same blueprint.[CR]The intro establishes that the eponymous Sokoban, or warehouse worker, must perform enough box-pushing puzzles to earn enough cash for a flashy new car so that he might finally impress the girl of his dreams.[CR]An added wrinkle is that each stage has a fixed move limit, and so the player must not only push the boxes in the right order but do so with maximum efficiency.

That is all the code does.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Change Intro[CR]At any time during stages where you control one of the heroes (not during stages where you control a vehicle IE snow speeder or spaceship), press and hold down the following buttons: A, B, X, Y and Down. While holding these, press Start to access a Sound Test. Use Left and Right to cycle through the tunes, press A to select the desired tune and listen to it. While still playing the selected tune, you can press Start to resume gameplay. Whatever tune you selected in the Sound Test will be playing in place of the stage's normal music! In effect, you could be in the middle of say, stage one with the boss theme or the ending theme playing instead of the Imperial March! Remember, on stages where you pilot vehicles this code will not work.</plot>

			<title_clean>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss</title_clean>
			<plot>Super Tetris 2 + Bombliss is one of the many versions of the famous soviet puzzle game, the first one available for the Super Nintendo, and an updated version of Tetris 2 + Bombliss.[CR]As the title would suggest, the game features both standard Tetris as well as another similar game called Bombliss. Tetris offers three game modes: standard marathon (A-type), start with garbage (B-type), and rising garbage (C-type). There is also a two-player versus mode where clearing rows sends garbage to the other player.[CR]Bombliss is slightly different from normal Tetris. Arranged on the board and in some dropped pieces are bomb squares. Completing a row does not clear the blocks in the row, but will trigger any bombs in the row which will destroy blocks. Different sizes of bombs will generate larger explosions. Bombliss is offered in standard marathon mode, a puzzle mode where a set board must be cleared using set piece drops, and a 2-player versus mode.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Change Music[CR]The game doesn't present you an option to change the music, but if you pause the game while playing and then press Select, you can choose from 7 songs.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Change Music[CR]Start a 1 Player mode, select Tetris Mode A, B or C and on the level select screen, press L + R + Select on controller 2. You should hear a sound if done right. Now you'll be able to select from 9 special levels.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Change Music[CR]At the "Select Player" screen, enter the "Eliminate Name" menu.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Tetris 3 is the second sequel to the Super Tetris series. It was developed by TOSE and published by Tetris license-holders Bullet-Proof Software on the Japanese Super Famicom exclusively.[CR]It continues to add new modes, following Super Tetris 2's inclusion of the chain reaction-heavy Bombliss mode. Super Tetris 3 has three such bonus modes:Magicaliss, a colorful variant that introduces rainbow pieces and gray pieces as well as a means to change the color of shapes by rotating them four times. Gray pieces drop in combinations of one, two or three pieces rather than the standard four-piece tetromino and these pieces cannot be cleared the standard way. Instead, they float in mid-air when the line disappears. In order to remove them, the player must form lines of the same color. Rainbow tetrominos are considered "wild cards" and will be counted as red, blue or green when in a line with the same uniform color.Sparkliss, which is a fantasy-themed variant of Bombliss in which the player is setting up gems to create larger chain-reactions. By clearing lines with gemstones in them, the gemstones will explode and take out a number of nearby pieces. Putting four gemstones into a square creates a much more powerful gemstone bomb. This mode also has a puzzle variant in which the player is given a specific grid layout and a finite number of pre-determined pieces and must clear the board.Famliss is simply the game's name for its four-player multiplayer mode. Rather than sending garbage to other players after clearing lines, there is a rotating bonus at the bottom of the screen that will activate as soon as the line(s) vanishes. It can either clear lines or add lines. </plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Tsumeshogi 1000 is a shogi game exclusive to the Super Famicom. "Tsumeshogi" is a word that refers to setting up specific shogi scenarios in which players can hit checkmate in a certain number of moves, similar to chess problems. The game presents each scenario with an on-screen counter and the player needs to figure out how to use the pieces they have available to checkmate their opponent in the number of moves indicated on the counter.[CR]The game was the first one to be published by Japanese company Bottom Up (Super Tsumeshogi 1000's developer is presently unknown). They would go on to publish many more games up until 2000, a lot of which are based on card and table-top games.[CR]	</plot>

The player has a number of customization options for the number of players, special rules and other features. The game also has a bright cartoony style and a number of anime portraits for the player(s) to use.[CR]As with the original card game, the goal is to be the first to play all the cards in the player character's hand. Each player can only play a card if it has the same number or color as the current card on the discard deck, otherwise they need to collect a new card. There are a number of exceptions, such as the Wild Card that can change the color in play. Other cards can put the player's opponents in dire straits, forcing them to add more cards to their deck and reversing the turn order.[CR]The game was released exclusively in Japan for the Super Famicom by Tomy Corporation. Tomy licensed the Uno brand from rival toy giant Mattel.</plot>

			<title_clean>Super Wagyan Land</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Wagyan Land is the first Super Famicom game in the Wagyan Land series from Namco, and the third game overall. The final NES sequel Wagyan Land 3 was released a year after this game.[CR]As with the previous games, the player controls a dinosaur named Wagyan (or Wagan) as he attempts to save his island home from Dr. Devil. Wagyan's only weapon is the sound waves he creates when he roars, which can only temporarily stun enemies rather than kill them. Likewise, boss battles aren't a physical fight to the death but rather a contest of wits, as the player must outsmart them in a game of concentration or the Japanese word game shiritori.[CR]Super Wagyan Land took advantage of the Super Nintendo's technological advancements to graphically enrich Wagyan Land, but much of the game's content is largely cribbed from the previous two games. In a sense, Super Wagyan Land is a "best of" compilation of Wagyan Land and Wagyan Land 2, including several musical tracks and stages. It also includes a new boss mini-game, which involves trying to guess which character or object a blurry mosaic represents.[CR]The game was also the first in the series to adopt a password system and a variable difficulty setting. Future Wagyan Land games would follow suit.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hitonami Course Passwords[CR]Enter any of the following passwords after selecting Password on the main menu:[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hitonami Course Passwords[CR]Enter any of the following passwords after selecting Password on the main menu:[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hitonami Course Passwords[CR]Enter any of the following passwords after selecting Password on the main menu:</plot>

The game actually follows immediately after the third and final Famicom entry, Wagyan Land 3, and continues the story from where it left off.[CR]As with earlier games in the series, the goal is to get Wagyan to the end of each level, occasionally stopping to take part in mini-games such as shiritori (a Japanese word game) and an image puzzle game where the player has to decipher a heavily pixelated image and name the character in the picture.[CR]Super Wagyan Land 2 was followed by Wagyan Paradise on the Super Famicom the following year.[CR]	</plot>

			<title_clean>Super Wrestle Angels</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Wrestle Angels is a card game that frames its matches as wrestling bouts, with the cards representing powerbombs and other wrestling moves. Players select cards from their deck each turn: the player with the highest value card will get the drop on their opponent's wrestler, performing a move on them and sapping their stamina gauge.[CR]The game is part of the Wrestle Angels game series, most of which were released on Japanese home computers. Though it features salacious close-ups of the female wrestlers, the game isn't overtly adult in nature.[CR]The many in-game wrestlers are exclusively female and have defined personalities and traits that come to the forefront during play. The game features a management mode in which the player can put together a stable of wrestlers and organize competitions for them. This management mode was introduced in an earlier game, but the Super Famicom version is considered the first to properly codify the template that future games would follow.</plot>

"Zugan" is a mutated form of the Japanese phrase for "bad luck".[CR]The game features a story mode, which has a plot that borrows from elements of the anime, or a free mode in which the player can choose any of twelve characters from the show to play as (and against).[CR]The game was followed by a sequel later the same year: Super Zugan 2: Tsukanpo Fighter.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Zugan 2: Tsukanpo Fighter is a mahjong game for the Super Famicom published by J-Wing. The game is based on the Super Zugan anime, about the student Hideyoshi Toyotomi and his severe misfortune whenever he is coerced into playing high-stakes mahjong with his three delinquent colleagues. The one light in his life, his buxom girlfriend Akina, is a lot more intelligent (and lucky) and tries desperately throughout the series to convince him to stop. It is the follow-up to Super Zugan: Hakotenjou kara no Shoutai, which was released earlier the same year.[CR]Super Zugan 2: Tsukanpo Fighter allows the player to construct a four-person game out of one of the many characters from the anime and a setting of their choice. The game is distinctive for showing the opponents sitting around the table, remarking on bad plays and showing various emotions depending on how well they're doing.</plot>

			<title_clean>Tactics Ogre - Let Us Cling Together</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tactics Orge: Let Us Cling Together, the second game directed by Yasumi Matsuno, is a turn-based RPG with a branching storyline and multiple endings based on moral decisions . Developed by Quest Corporation, it received good reviews, however few copies were made as it was a limited release. Originally released for the Super Famicom (Japanese SNES) in Japan on October 6, 1995, it was later debuted in the US on the Playstation. A remake of Tactics Orge has been released for the PSP (Tactics Ogre: Wheel of Fate) and was released on Febuary 15, 2011. The remake featured a re-translation of the script, enhanced graphics, and numerous other changes to the core game.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The Game takes place in the kingdom of Valeria, an island where three main ethnic groups vie for political control. The three castes are Bacrumese, the upper class people of the land, Gargastan, diverse common making up the majority of the people in Valeria, and Walstanian which are a oppressed minority who live in the most southern part of Valeria.Normal Interface[CR]Many years ago Valeria flourished as a trade port, however war brewed between ethnic groups, each vying for political control. This continued for years until Dolgare, a man desiring peace and unity, rose to power, becoming the King of the entire island. In order to assure feuds would be eradicated, he set up an official religion and encouraged inter-ethnic marriages. He spent much of his time quelling arguments and altercation. His reign lasted for half a century.[CR]After King Dolgare's death, the leader of the Bacrumese, Bishop Branta, dominated the aristocrat class. With Bishop Branta in command and military support from Lodis, a major country north of Valeria, the Bacrumese declared the independence of the capital city of Heigm, establishing Bacrum-Valeria. Branta proposed conquering the entire island, however this was subjugated by the leader of the Dark Knight Order of Roslolian, Lans Tartare, as he did not want to waste military power by having a "useless war". Thus Branta was forced to yield to Lans Tartare's objection, giving up the invasion.In-Town Closeup[CR]The South part of Valeria, was split into two main groups; Gargastan which made up seventy percent of the population which supported the nationalist movement lead by Barbatos, and Walstanians which covered about ten percent of the population. The Gargastan people declared war against the Walstanians. The Walstanians, being outnumbered seven to one, were massacred. Duke Ronway was made ruler of Walsta and for half of a year he lead its people in defense against the Gargastans to no avail. Walsta was defeated and Cardinal Barbatos established the Gargatan Kingdom. Despite Barbatos attempts to stop the internal disputes, the oppression of Walstanians never ceased.[CR]What remained of the Walsta fought back against the Gargastan Kingdom until Duke Ronway was captured. Duke Ronway's imprisonment left Walsta's people desperate, and many moved into a Walsta self-governing district which was provided by the Gargastans.[CR]The game starts in the port town of Griate, the player takes control of Denim, a soldier of the Walsta Liberation Army.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] Mechanics[CR]Item Management[CR]Liken to other tactical turn-based RPGs, the player has a team of several characters with negotiable classes. Battles take place on isometric battlefields. In contrast to tactical turn-based RPGs, the order of movement is determined by the stats of individual characters. Battles are broken up by in-engine cutscenes, exploration is preformed via grid-based movement, and Inventory is managed via map interface.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Denim PowellDenim Powell[CR]Raised as a Walstanian, however during the game, he discovers his true identity. Denim Mown (Powell) is actually a Bacrum, and he alone can tip the balance in the war between Walstain and Bacrum.Kachua PowellKachua Powell[CR]Follows her brother everywhere, until she tires of the fighting and runs away. It is later revealed by the Dark Knights that her real name is Bersalia Overis and that she is the heir apparent of King Dolgare's throne. If she dies, Denim becomes ruler, but if she lives, she retains control of the throne - this is completely dependent on the player's choices.Vice BozegVice Bozeg[CR]Denim's best friend. His role is entirely determined by the moral choices of the player.Lans HamiltonLans Hamilton[CR]Made an appearance in prequel Ogre Battle, the Holy Knight, Lans was dispatched by King Tristan to find the Brunhild, Fenril's Holy Sword. Lans defended Rime during the attack from Bacrum, but was overpowered and captured by the Dark Knights. Once freed from Heigm Castle, he was then corrupted.Lans TartareLans Tartare[CR]As the leader of the Roslolian Dark Knights, he is one of sixteen Knights privileged to have the title Death Templar, which is the paramount of prestigious titles in Lodis. It is said that he holds the power of a hundred knights.Judah RonwayJudah Ronway[CR]The leader of the Walsta Liberation Army for, which Denim is a soldier. Their sole purpose is to usurp the oppression of the Gargastan Kingdom. He dies regardless of the moral decisions of the player.Rayunder BarbatosRayunder Barbato[CR]Leader of the Gargastan Army and instigator of the "ethnic cleansing policy" responsible for a third of the Walstanians being massacred, he spends most of his time plotting conquest of Valeria. He dies regardless of the players actions. He either commits suicide or is executed for his crimes by Duke Ronway.Branta MownBranta Mown[CR]He helped cover up King Dolgare's fling with a servant by the request of the Queen. He gave Bersalia, the illegitimate daughter to his brother Plancy to be raised as Kachua Powell. The Queen promoted him to the highest-ranked religious official in Valeria, the title of Bishop. However, because of his lust for power, he sought help from the Dark Knights, and when they would not help him conquer all of Valeria, he turned to Dragon Magic and the Forbidden Power. He dies during the assault of Heigm from the Liberation Army.[CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR][B]Soundtrack:[/B][CR]Hitoshi Sakimoto &amp; Masaharu Iwata composed the music which was released in 1995 under the label DataM/Polystar.Track listingsDisk One - Original Version (68:36)Disk Two - MIDI Version (59:46)Disk Three - MIDI Version (43:55)Overture (1:03)Unit March (1:24)Chaotic Island (2:57)Fortune Teller 2 (1:14)Catastrophe (1:30)Island Atlas (0:38)Prepare to Take the Field (0:40)Blasphemous Experiment (1:38)A Cygnet (0:53)Vendetta!

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tadaima Yuusha Boshuuchuu Okawari is a 1994 board game RPG from Human Entertainment for the Super Famicom. It followed a couple of other similar attempts to merge a fantasy RPG with a multiplayer board game; the most successful of which would become the Dokapon series.[CR]Up to four players take control of a hero each from a pool of twelve. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses. Each player character walks around a map heading for specific locations as well as all manner of random events (or battles) depending on where they land.</plot>

			<title_clean>Tales of Phantasia</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]One of the bigger games on the Super Famicom, coming in at 48 megabits, Phantasia was a tour de force of SNES programming thanks in part to Hiroya Hatsushiba's "Flexible Voice Driver," which allowed extensive (for the time) voice acting and a full pop song opening, Yoshida Yukari's "Yume wa Owaranai," on a home console. Famed manga artist K&#333;suke Fujishima's character designs would further cement the series' anime aesthetic. Aside from this, it was also the progenitor of the Linear Motion Battle System and much of the series' staple items, skills, and pantheon of Summon Creatures that continue to be expanded upon. This has caused some confusion much in the way Final Fantasy has with its recurring themes and names, though as of now only Tales of Phantasia: Narikiri Dungeon, Tales of Symphonia, and Tales of Symphonia: Dawn of the New World are known to connect to Phantasia's 'Aselia' timeline.[CR]Phantasia has enjoyed a Tales record of 4 re-releases. These include an enhanced remake on PlayStation, a hybrid SNES/PSX version on GBA with some added events, and two releases on PSP that upgraded sprite detail, added substantial amounts of voice acting (hence the name "Full-Voice Edition"), and included the GBA exclusive sub-events. The 2nd PSP release, Tales of Phantasia X (pronounced "Cross"), part of Narikiri Dungeon X, looks to refine the formula further. While the GBA version and an anime adaptation are the only ones to be officially localized into English, many fan translation groups have attempted to patch various versions with English text. Most notable of these was DeJap's release of the SNES version in 2001.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]The Sealing of Dhaos.[CR]100 years ago, 4 warriors fought and sealed away an Evil King that had been terrorizing humanity. Unaware of this conflict and his family's ties to it, Cless Alvein lives a simple life in the village of Toltus as a hunter of local game and apprentice to his father, Alvein Sword Style Master Miguel Alvein. He sets off on an ordinary hunt alongside his childhood friend, Chester Barklight, but is soon sent racing back by the sound of the village's warning bell. Thunder began to roll as a horrifying sight greeted them: the villagers had all been slaughtered, including Miguel and Maria Alvein and Chester's little sister Ami. His mother's dying words pleaded Cless to flee with the pendant he had been entrusted with before the marauders returned. Though initially only set on revenge against the ones responsible, the two would find themselves thrust into a complex conflict spanning time and space.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Cless Alvein - The prototypical swordsman and first line of defense for the party, Cless is a skilled and resourceful fighter, able to incorporate swords, axes and spears along with shields into his techniques. He is upright and disciplined, often looking out for others, but he can be a little naive. Though not dense by any means, Cless tends to comically fumble his way through dungeons and puzzles. He also has a love of horrible puns and wordplay. When it comes to Dhaos, however, his hatred borders on fanaticism.[CR]Chester Barklight - Chester is the Legolas to Cless's Aragorn, dishing out pain from afar with his trusty bow. Although hotheaded and bitter over his loss, he sees the need to be upbeat when Cless can't be. He doesn't think twice about putting himself in harm's way for his friend, who he feels is far more capable than himself. Chester tries not to sweat the small stuff too much. His aim and drive to improve are second to none.[CR]Mint Adnade - Cless finds Mint trapped in Euclid's prison when he himself is captured by the "Man in Black Armor." He comes to find she's also related to one of the 4 heroes and was holding a similar pendant before it was stolen. Mint is the healer of the group and a faithful priestess. Her only offensive spells are debuffs and 'Pikohan', strange toy hammers that fall from the sky and stun enemies. Although she's very proper and ladylike, Mint can also be romantic and impulsive when it comes to subjects like love and matchmaking and isn't afraid to express her opinion. She has a love of piano and plays proficiently.[CR]Klarth F. Lester - Cless and Mint meet Klarth 100 years in the past in a substantially quieter Euclid Village. He has been researching ways in which humans could use magic like elves and half-elves do with his partner, Mirald. It's Mirald who finally convinces Klarth to go along with the two without payment, as their goals are basically the same: the party needs magic to combat Dhaos and Klarth needs to travel to form pacts with Summons through the use of rare Pact Rings. He can be selfish and crude at times, but his knowledge, wisdom and Summons make him invaluable. His pinup collection is infamous.[CR]Arche Klaine - Arche is a mischievous half-elf who rides a broom and casts spells that make enemies go boom. Once her identity is revealed, her father Bart of Lone Valley gives her permission to journey with the group and use her magic to take down Dhaos. Arche is bright and cheery and even a little boy crazy, but she shows moments of weakness and frustration when it comes to the poor treatment of half-elves and her missing Elven mother. Her cooking can be fatal.[CR]Suzu Fujibayashi - This little kunoichi (female ninja) hails from the mysterious hidden Ninja Village. Suzu is the granddaughter of the village chief and next in line after her parents. Despite her small stature and young age, she's deadly serious and determined to master Igaguri Ninja Arts. Although she does her best to mask her emotions, she has a bit of a crush on Cless and a monster sweet tooth. She was originally an NPC in the SNES version, but can be recruited in all subsequent releases if you complete her sidequest.[CR]Dhaos - Dhaos is his name, Dhaos Laser is his game. Little is known about his actual motives, but the party nevertheless sets out to stop his evil machinations. He has an odd attachment to the Mana Tree Yggdrasil and its guardian, Martel...[CR](All names are based on Japanese documentation.)[CR]Battle System[CR]Fight a Slime in Real-Time[CR]Battles take place in real-time on a 2D plane that characters can freely move on, much like that of a classic 2D fighting game, except button inputs are limited to whichever button is selected for skills up, down, left or right, or without a direction on the D-Pad for a total of 4 skills or spells that can be set, not counting shortcuts. Using skills or casting spells costs the character TP, or Technical Points, which can be replenished with items, food, sleeping, or slightly when a battle ends. There is a slight exception to this, as there is an item that allows Cless to perform any move without the use of TP if you perform the proper input. This is also how Cless uses Stan's Satsugeki Bukouken with Stan's sword, Dymlos.[CR]Also introduced for the first time in the PlayStation version of Phantasia was the Mystic Arte, a desperation move Cless can use if he equips the right Title and holds Guard, Skill and Attack during a combination move when his HP is low enough. Some of the older SNES concepts such as range affecting which skills you could use and Cless being the only playable character were abandoned, but the stopping of time when a spell is performed has pervaded in every release of Phantasia. Combat as a whole is somewhat slower paced than later games in the series, but the core concepts continue to shape the ever progressing LMBS System.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]Motoi Sakuraba, the game's most prominent composer, makes a cameo appearance in Alvanista's guild bar as a pianist named Sakuraba, who plays a song for the party. The real Sakuraba is himself a keyboardist.Similarly, Yomi, the songstress that sings the PSX and PSP opening can be found in Alvanista Castle under certain conditions.Even in the international versions of the game where the opening song was removed, Yume wa Owaranai can be heard "sung" by a dog in a house in Euclid City.Sleeping in Miguel Village at certain points in the PSX version and beyond will net you scenes with Chester that level him up significantly closer to the rest of the party. Another one with Cless involves defeating the members of the Miguel Sword Fighting School and then sleeping in the same inn. Cless dreams of his father and is then able to use the ultimate Alvein Style desperation attack.Stan's sister Lilith from Tales of Destiny makes a cameo appearance in the Euclid Arena as a secret boss in the PSX and PSP versions. If you win, you get Stan's sword Dymlos, which allows Cless to use Satsugeki Bukouken when he reaches level 100.Odin's Valkyrie is a cameo character from another Namco game in which she stars, Legend of Valkyrie . She's moonlighted in many Tales games.They player can reacquire Odin's spear Gungnir with boosted stats and a fabulous new color if you defeat him in the future at Odin's Tower.In the sunken city Thor, interact with the projection TV and under the Game Channel you can play Groovy Arche, a fun little Gradius-esque minigame starring Arche. BONUS! Available on PSX, PSP, and Japanese cellphones.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hard Mode[CR]In the title screen, highlight New game and press A, B, Y and X on the controller at the same time. You will hear "Ya ta!" upon doing so, indicating you've done it right.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Alternate Ending Theme[CR]Beat the game, and before the credits start, hold down the R and L buttons and release after the credits appear. You will hear "Tomorrow is a Holiday," the other ending instead of the normal credits theme.</plot>

			<plot>Sasami is kidnapped by a mysterious little girl with magical powers, and Tenchi and his companions must travel to rescue her, battling monsters and other creatures on the way.[CR]Tenchi Muyou! Game-Hen is a strategy game with RPG elements, based on the popular Japanese Tenchi Muyo! cartoon series. The game moves from battle to battle, with the plot being revealed through cutscenes between them. The player fights the computer on turns, controlling the individuals from a party of four. The party members are selected on a separate screen before each battle, and as the game progresses new characters become available.[CR]During the skirmish, selecting the characters brings up a menu with three command options: move, attack or end turn. A fourth transform option becomes available later, after they reach a higher level. When moving or attacking, glowing tiles on the ground show the maximum range of the action. Performing either one costs action points, shown as eight regenerating green dots on the status window, alongside basic statistics like health, defense and attack levels. Characters level up automatically while on the battlefield, increasing their abilities and receiving more powerful attacks. Health powers are also accessed through the attack menu, recovering lost points to an ailing comrade within their range. Characters can transform to a more powerful version when they have the ability to do so, and all the eight green dots are still available. The transformed unit has more powerful attacks and a wider range of movement.[CR]After the battle, a map screen appears where the player can save the game, and choose the next battle from one of the available paths. It is possible to revisit battlegrounds, to level up before tackling stronger enemies.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tengai Makyou Zero is a turn-based RPG created by RED Company and Hudson for the Super Famicom in 1995. The game is the fourth entry in the Tengai Makyou franchise and is the only game in the series to be released for the Super Famicom.Tengai Makyou Zero lacks the cut-scenes, voice acting, and CD quality music that the franchise is known for due to the limitations of Nintendo's hardware. However Zero's presentation not only competes with the rest of the series but it is also one of the most graphically advanced titles on the Super Famciom thanks to the cartridge's SPC7110 decompression chip. The SPC7110 chip was developed by the Seiko Epson Corporation and it allowed Red Company to compress over 72mbits of game data into Zero's already hefty 40mbit cartridge. Zero's cartridge also contained an internal battery that powered a real world clock that would unlocks special time specific events in the game.</plot>

			<plot>Reyard is a young man who lives in the town of Farell; his father is a skilled blacksmith, and the youngster hopes to follow the same career, enjoying a peaceful life. But everything changes when a wandering group of performers arrives in the town. Reyard meets Kurana, one of the artists, who was adopted by the leader of the troop, and is hoping to find her true parents. The two meet several times, and Reyard realizes that he has fallen in love. However, when Kurana tells him she will leave Farell soon, he is unable to express his feelings. Only when he hears that the duke of Bern is determined to marry Kurana, even against her will, Reyard understands that he has to do something...[CR]Tenshi no Uta: Shiroki Tsubasa no Inori ("The Prayer of the White Wings") is the third game in the  series. It starts a new story, but is set in the same universe; the stories of the two previous games are referred to in this game, and recurrent characters appear. The game is a traditional Japanese-style RPG with top-down navigation, random enemies, turn-based combat (viewed from first-person perspective), linear story progression, and automatic leveling. The stand-out feature of the game is the ability to communicate with monsters encountered in battle, by learning "monster languages". It is possible to convince the monsters not to fight, and even trade and acquire rare items from them.</plot>

			<title_clean>Tetris Battle Gaiden</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tetris Battle Gaiden (&#12486;&#12488;&#12522;&#12473; &#12496;&#12488;&#12523;&#22806;&#20253; &#27494;&#38360;&#22806;&#20253;, Tetorisu Batoru Gaiden But&#333; Gaiden) is a competitive puzzle-battle game, similar to games such as Puzzle Fighter or Puyo Puyo. One can play against a friend or the Computer in a story mode. There is also an included Rensa mode, which ensures a more hyperactive game due to increased gravity. The player can choose from a list of characters in the story mode, including a Dragon or a pumpkin named Halloween.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Tetries Battle Gaiden differs from classic Tetris in its puzzle-fighter style game play. A player will draw tetrominos from the same 3 piece preview as his opponent. The goal of the game is to complete lines of horizontal blocks to clear them from the field. As in most Tetris versus modes, clearing two or more lines at once will send "garbage lines" to the opponent, making it advantageous to set up situations where two or more lines are cleared at once. The player wins when their opponent is unable to place a tetromino into their playing field. Removing lines from their own field and adding lines to their opponent's is also possible through the use of character-specific special abilities. These abilities are obtained through the collection of magic orbs. After a set number of tetrominos passes through the piece preview, a piece containing a magic orb will appear (the default setting is every 5th piece, although this can be changed in the options). These orbs are collected when lines containing them are cleared by a player. When the player activates an ability, the number of magic orbs they have (ranging from one to four) determines the ability they will use. Abilities are unique to each character, and include an earthquake, orbital laser, mirror shield, or the ability to knock away an opponents piece.Game Modes[CR]The game has three separate modes to select from in the Settings menu. They are Battlis, Tetris, and Rensa.Battlis[CR]Battlis is the standard game mode.Tetris[CR]A standard Tetris mode. There are no magic pieces and no special abilities, although players still share the same piece preview.Rensa[CR]In Rensa mode, whenever a line is cleared, all non-magic blocks above the cleared line fall individually (as opposed to moving together as a line, like in regular Tetris), causing them to fill in any gaps below. This can lead to many-line combos beyond the standard four-line Tetris. This allows players to make comebacks from dire near-loss situations, which in turn causes games to last much longer than normal. Rensa (&#36899;&#37782;, rensa) is the Japanese word that means "chain" or "connection".[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]There are 8 playable characters in Tetris Battle Gaiden, all with 4 attacks each. The game's two bosses, Dragon and Queen, are only playable by entering the following code on the copyright screen: B, B, X, X, A, Y, A, Y, Up, Left. If done correctly, the copyright text will turn blue. At the character select screen, hold L+A when picking a character to play as Dragon, or R+A to play as Queen.[CR]The abilities of each character are listed below. The amount of magic orbs a player needs to activate an ability correlate to the number next to its name.Main CharactersHalloween (The Pumpkin Head)Fry (&#12501;&#12521;&#12452;, Furai): Completely fills in the bottom 3 lines.

Both have unique abilitiesDragonPress (&#12503;&#12524;&#12473;, Puresu): A recovery technique that is a combination of Shaman's "Moses" and Mirurun's "Mirurun" techniques.

Fills in 4 lines instead of 3, which will clear and be sent as garbage lines after the next piece is dropped.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Top Management II is a 1994 business simulation game from Koei, part of their Koei Executive Series, and the sequel to their 1990 NES/PC-9801 game Top Management. Koei released the game on PC Windows, the NEC PC-9801 and the Super Famicom. The goal of the game is to grow the player character's nascent corporation to be one of the largest and most profitable in the world with savvy business practice. Possibly due to the large amount of text and Japan-centric business terminology, the game was never released outside of Japan.[CR]The PC-9801 version is considerably denser than the other two versions, featuring many additional features to create a closer proximity to actual business ownership.[CR]	</plot>

On your last lap, when you are nearing the finish line simply make half of your car (go fast) run into the finishing line. Because of this, the front part of the car will cross (giving you 1st place) and than the car will bounce back and go forward again (giving you 2nd place too).</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Toride ("Fortress", sometimes referred to as Pai Toride or "Mahjong Tile Fortress") is a mahjong solitaire game released exclusively in Japan first in the Arcade and subsequently on the Super Famicom in 1994. The Arcade version is sometimes referred to as "Last Fortress".[CR]The game was followed by Daitoride ("Great Fortress") in 1995. Like Toride it was first released in the Arcade and then to a single home console; in this case the Sega Saturn.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player must clear all the tiles on the screen, as per usual mahjong solitaire rules, but in order to do so they have to store matching tiles along the bottom of the screen. The player's "hand" has a limited number of slots available, and if the player fills it up with pieces that don't match then they have failed. There is also a timer for the whole round that ticks down whenever the player is deliberating on their next move, and removing pairs of pieces from play will slightly refill it. There are also special power-up tiles that increase the timer.[CR]As with mahjong solitaire, the player can only match identical tiles. The exception are the eight unique season and flower tiles, which can be paired off with any other season or flower (though it has to be two seasons or two flowers).[CR]	</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Torneko no Daibouken: Fushigi no Dungeon ("Torneko's Great Adventure: Mystery Dungeon") is a role-playing game developed and published by Chunsoft for the Super Famicom and Satellaview platforms. It is the first game in Chunsoft's Mystery Dungeon series of Roguelike dungeon crawlers, which would frequently crossover with other RPG series (such as Pokemon).[CR]Torneko Taloon is a character introduced in Dragon Quest IV. He's notable for not being a traditional "hero": rather than a chosen youth, he's an overweight travelling merchant with a doting family and an uncanny knack for finding valuable items after fighting monsters, which he then resells at exorbitant prices at his store. Torneko no Daibouken continues his avaricious adventures, delving into a procedurally-generated dungeon to look for more treasure.[CR]Torneko no Daibouken: Fushigi no Dungeon was only released in Japan. It was followed by a couple of GBA sequels: Dragon Quest Characters: Torneko no Daibouken 2 and Dragon Quest Characters: Torneko no Daibouken 3.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Strong equipment at beginning of game[CR]In the beginning of the game, the king wants you to go into the Trial Dungeon.

			<title_clean>Treasure Hunter G</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Treasure Hunter G was developed at a time when the failing SNES had to compete against the Playstation and as such displays a technical prowess that was the height of SNES programming know how. For instance, the majority of sprites are rendered from 3D models and the Mode 7 overworld is arguably the most vivid and 3D of any game on the system, both of which combine to make the visuals sharper and clearner than some Playstation titles, arguably even Final Fantasy VII - the over world, at least. Not to be just a pretty face though, Treasure Hunter G's outstanding technical visuals are backed up with a solid gameplay mechanics, such as a fun and user friendly grid based tactical combat system and, though it may now sound underwhelming, the ability to move in eight directions - up, down, left, right and the diagonals. As well as this the game boasts an inventive and consistantly brilliant sound track, courtesy of 7 composers, including names such as Hitoshi Sakimoto and Masaharu Iwata. Running through the core of Treasure Hunter G is simple story, especially when compared to Final Fantasy VI and VII, that would feel almost purfunctory if it wasn't for the rich veins of charm, humour and enchantment that flow through every aspect of the game.[CR][B]History:[/B][CR]Developed by Sting Entertainment and published by Square Soft in 1996, Treasure hunter G ultimately proved to be Square Soft's swan song for Nintendo consoles - at least until their 2002 Japan only release of Chokobo Rando (Chocobo Land: A game of Dice). As the game was a Japanese exclusive and was released in the face of the Playstation's rapidly mounting popularity Treasure Hunter G quickly fell into obscurity. Acclaim and popularity are hard to gauge as both reviews and sales figures are incredibly thin on the ground - even Famitsu appear to have sidestepped it. As the game was never released outside of Japan Treasure Hunter G remains reletively unknown in the west but has nontheless picked up a small cult following in the import and ROM scenes. However, with its recent release in Japan on the Wii's Virtual there now exists a slim chance of a western localisation that could finally bring this hidden wonder to light.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]At the start of the game you meet the two main protagnonists, Red and Blue G, who are under the care of their Grandfather while their father, Brown G, is away treasure hunting. Your grandfather, Silver G, gets you up and takes you to investigate some strange goings on at a nearby cave, goings on in which Brown G so happens to be involved. After returning to returning home and saving their village from a mysterious fire, Red and Blue are joined by Rain, a girl with partial amnesia, and Ponga, a violin playing Monkey. The four heroes embark on a journey to find Brown G and get wrapped up in a confrontation with the recently awakened Dark Lord.[CR]Treasure Hunter G offers a fairly recognisable tale of good Vs. evil and relies heavily on classic crutches such as amnesia, sleeping terrors, "The Ancients", other worlds and imprisoned fairies/ angels/ spirits(et.c), but it contains enough backstory, sidestory, witty asides and unashamed silliness to make up for it.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The general out of battle gameplay is like that of most RPGs in that you move you character around the towns, dungeons and over world interacting with certain objects and a wealth of often humourous NPCs. The only thing to make this aspect of play really stand out is the ability to move diagonally. It is the battle system that really stands out. Anyone that has played Final Fantasy Tactics or the Breath of Fire games or any other tactical RPG will be instantly familiar with the basic mechanics. The combat is turn based and revolves around a grid system that dictates how many action points it takes to perform any given action, from moving to attacking. Like Chrono Trigger the encounters are not random as potential enemies are found either wandering around certain areas and wont attack unless you get too close, or they will jump out at you when you pass certain points, forcing combat upon you. Also like Chrono trigger a character recieve experience points every time their attack hits an enemy, but the whole team recieves exp. when a combat in won. While it is possible to beat the game by simply slogging your way through these battles the real skill, and in deed fun, doesn't really emerge until you start learning how to use the grid system tactically. One command that really highlights this is the throw command which allows one character to help another out of a tight spot by either throwing a healing/ buff item at them or taking out their enemy with well thrown weapon or debuff item. This is just one of the polished machanics that really make combat shine.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Red G - The older, sensible and ultimately more powerful of the two G brothers. He is the slightly overpowered, sword wielding, warrior class character you find at the centre of many RPGs. He is just and valliant and has the brute force to back it up, though that doesn't mean he is without intelligence, wit and a quick tongue.Blue G - He often cries and is usually the butt of the joke, especially if Red is the one making it, but Blue G is certainly far from unlikable. In battle he takes a touch more practice to use effectively as his long reaching spear requires good positioning to realise its potential and his traps are worthless unless you have the guile to lure or force the enemy to trip them.Rain - A mystery girl with amnesia and hidden powers. Being the only girl in the party she rather predictably takes on the role of white mage class character, making her invaluable. She also plays the part of Red's almost love interest.Ponga - He's a violin playing monkey with mad black magic skills and an inability to say anything beyond "Ooki", though this doesn't stop conversing with Rain, his long time companion. Cute, funny and incredibly powerful he rounds the team off nicely providing the ranged heavy support.[CR]Audience[CR]While the somewhat simple story, cute characters and relative shortness (20 hours, give or take) make this game accessible to younger gamers that shouldn't mean it should be shunned by the older, more experienced or more hardcore. The tactical nature of the combat allows for as much complexity as you want and there are certain connotations only an older player would get. This game is probably best played by RPG connoisseurs looking for a break from the regular fare, or by any classic gamer looking for something obscure and a bit different.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Frog Casino - Secret Area[CR]In the grand Frog Casino at the Port City of Akrass (the first town of the third island), there is a golden frog statue. Talking to it will bring up a dialog asking for a secret code. It will ask for a four-character/digit code.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Frog Casino - Secret Area[CR]In the Japanese game the three options are all katakana syllables. The idea is to spell out "KE" "RO" "KE" "RO" ("kerokero" = the Japanese equivalent of "ribbit").[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Frog Casino - Secret Area[CR]In the English patched version, the choices correspond to "3" "1" "3" "1" for the code (or, basically, the third, first, third and first options, on each dialog respectively).[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Frog Casino - Secret Area[CR]Once you enter the code, the statue will open its jaws and you can walk into it to find a secret basement area with more game tables to play at.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Tsuyoshi Shikkari Shinasai Taisen Puzzle-Dama is a Super Famicom puzzle game from Konami. It features the cast of the manga and anime Tsuyoshi Shikkari Shinasai (usually localized as "Hang in There, Tsuyoshi") and Konami's own spin on Puyo Puyo: Taisen Puzzle-Dama ("Battle Puzzle Ball"). The goal of the game is to compete with a series of characters from Tsuyoshi Shikkari Shinasai depending on who the player selected.[CR]Play involves stacking duos of faces of various colors. If the player completes a set of three faces - they don't have to be lined up, but they do need to be adjacent - the faces disappear. If they are next to a "trapped" face it is transformed into a normal face block. Ideally, the player completes a three-strong stack of identical-colored trapped faces and frees them in groups of three, which will then lead to a chain as those three vanish and free more trapped faces.[CR]The game was the first home console version of Konami's Taisen Puzzle-Dama series and the second game overall. The first version was the Arcade game Taisen Puzzle-Dama released earlier the same year. Future Taisen Puzzle-Dama games would also similarly feature anime license tie-ins, as well as characters from Konami's other properties.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]He still hasn't realized she isn't standing there.[CR]UFO Kamen Yakisoban: Kettler no Kuroi Inbou ("UFO Kamen Yakisoban: Kettler's Black Conspiracy") is a brawler featuring UFO Kamen Yakisoban, a character designed to market Nissin's Yakisoba UFO brand of instant yakisoba circa 1993-1995. It understandably features a variety of foodstuffs. [CR]In the game, Yakisoban's bride-to-be Mayumi has been kidnapped by the villainous Kettler who wishes to marry her himself (and of course to destroy the concept of delicious Nissin Brand  &#169;  instant Yakisoba!). Yakisoban is obviously a bit dense, as he's standing at the altar and doesn't even realize Mayumi is not there until part-way through the ceremony.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Yakisoban's awesome DASH KICK. [CR]The game features standard brawler mechanics for the era. Yakisoban can punch and jump. The player can also make Yakisoban roll around by double tapping forward or backwards; attacking while rolling causes Yakisoban to perform a diving kick. However, these aren't Yakisoban's truly impressive special abilities!Sauce Beam: Press and hold down the A button to fill Yakisoban's sauce meter. Let go to fire the sauce beam, both deadly AND delicious!  Agedama Bomber: Hold down the R button and press attack to perform this. Yakisoban scatters agedama everywhere, causing damage to all enemies on the screen with the tiny bits of fried gluten! This can only be performed so long as Yakisoban has some agedama on him.The awesome power of the sauce beam.  Aonori Flash: Hold down the L button and attack to perform this. Yakisoban scatters aonori everywhere; all enemies are mesmerized and paralyzed for a period of time by the little green flakes. This can only be performed so long as Yakisoban has some aonori.[CR]After the player advances to a certain point in the game, Yakisoban gets upgraded to YAKISOBAN GREAT, an allegedly even more powerful form for a more powerful hunger! However, gameplay-wise he is pretty much the same. Some of his attacks have slightly better range, though. ItemsShow them the true power of a unicycle! [CR]There are a variety of items to be found in the game to help Yakisoban defeat the villainous Kettler and rescue his bride-to-be.Sauce Gun: Increase the power of the sauce beam by equipping a SECOND one! Agedama: More fried gluten balls for the Agedama bomber!Aonori: More delicious seaweed flakes for the Aonori Flash!Extra costume: An extra life for Yakisoban.Super Tent: Refills some of Yakisoban's HP.Yakisoban Ichirinsha: The Yakisoban Unicycle! Pick this up to become invincible and trounce any enemies by charging into them.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR] Stay in school![CR]Yakisoban: A noodle hero from the planet Men (a planet made entirely of noodles), he fights for Justice and the great convenient test of Nissin's UFO brand&#169; instant Yakisoba. He has a variety of vehicles, all of which resemble the product's package.[CR]Kettler: A supervillain who is opposed to the concept of "instant" noodles. He also has the audacity to DARE to eat them with a FORK. How low can he go? He's kidnapped Yakisoban's fiance Mayumi in an effort to marry her himself; he's also posing as a news commentator for an anti instant noodle campaign across Japan. He's originally from Chicago. Amusingly, he proved to be a more enduring character than Yakisoban himself and was featured in advertisements long after Yakisoban had faded away.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Each stage is seperated into several segments which are timed by a tea-kettle in the lower right hand corner. Should the kettle reach the boiling point, the player will lose a life. Along the way Yakisoban will have to fight his way through huge numbers of mysterious agents and other Kettler henchmen.[CR]Stage 1, Summer Festival at the Temple: Yakisoban explodes on to the scene at a matsuri at a Shinto temple! Kettler has sent out his minion "Teppan Otoko": a master of okonomiyaki-making with an anti-yakisoba attitude. Some other enemies encountered include roller-skating men with tea kettle masks and flying dragons riding in ramen bowls. SPECTER agents are everywhere... sometimes even in the ground. Teppan Otoko ends the stage by ambushing Yakisoban disguised as a Yakisoba booth.Battle at Davy's! [CR]Stage 2, Davy's Family Restaurant: This time Kettler deploys the vile Mr. Fork to put an end to Yakisoban's fight for justice and instant foodstuffs. It's a shame the food eaten here isn't all instant (or maybe it is...) but peace must be preserved! Yakisoban pummels his way through more hordes of SPECTER agents and the new added threat of pie-throwing chefs wearing kettles on their feet. Mr. Fork waits at the end. Be wary of his sudden diving attack! [CR]Stage 3, the Construction Project: This time Kettler deploys a most insidious minion, Oyuma the hot water demon! Unsurprisingly the area is swarming with SPECTER. Creepy chopstick women and toothpick holder monsters also burst on to the scene to give Yakisoban another taste of eating utensil fury. Wait, what's that kettle doing at the top of this building? Oh no, it's Oyuma! Yakisoban triumphs, but his power is drained... is this the end?How about a side of racism to go with those noodles?[CR]Stage 4, the Amusement Park: Of course not, Yakisoban powers up to become YAKISOBAN GREAT! Now in a bigger container for bigger hunger! Keen to turn public perception against instant noodles, Kettler allies with a fake Yakisoban (his clothing is labeled USO, or "lie", instead of UFO) to tarnish the real deal's flawless reputation. Anyway, what amusement park would be complete without clowns? Clowns AND SPECTER agents, to be precise. Is Yakisoban Great up to the challenge of clowns and the outrageous incredibly offensive fake Yakisoban? Of course!This is what we've all been waiting for! [CR]Stage 5, the UTV Station! The final countdown begins! Yakisoban has tracked Kettler to his hideout in Japan, the UTV station; he's posing as a commentator on a T.V. show to spread his anti instant-noodle views to the public. "Are instant noodles causing a rise in crime?" Fox has NOTHING on this station! Everything Yakisoban has faced in the past is here and ready to stop him; the station must also double as SPECTER's Japan HQ. Can Yakisoban defeat Kettler? Can he rescue Mayumi in time? Will the fight increase ratings if the cameras keep on rolling? Tune in and find out!</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Uchuu no Kishi: Tekkaman Blade (usually translated as "Space Knight: Tekkaman Blade") is a shoot 'em up game based on the anime of the same name, which was a 1990s relaunch of the original 1970s Tekkaman anime. It features a sword-wielding mech fighting to emancipate the Earth from the bug-like alien race known as Radam, who use the Tekkamen (transformed human captives) as their footsoldiers.[CR]The game is a traditional side-scrolling shoot 'em up for the most part, with the player controlling Tekkaman Blade as he cuts a swath through the alien forces. When encountering a boss in the SNES version, often a humanoid enemy Tekkaman of relative size to Tekkaman Blade, the game switches to a basic one-on-one fighting game with larger character sprites.[CR]Tekkaman Blade was first released on Game Boy by Sun L and Yutaka in December 1992 and then on the Super Famicom by A.I. and BEC in July 1993. A PC-9801 version, which plays far more like a strategy game, was released in 1994.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Secondary Colors for Tekkamen[CR]After you press Start on the Title Screen and the menu pops up, press:</plot>

			<plot>Ultima: The False Prophet is a Role-Playing game, developed by Infinity and published by Pony Canyon,which was released in Japan in 1992.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Bonus hidden items in your inventory[CR]At any time in the game where you have at least 16 items you can do this.  You need to transfer enough items into your 'bag' in your inventory so that when you scroll to the bottom of your 'bag' and exit your bag there will be no items in your main inventory on the screen.  This can be accomplished early in the game by picking up items until you have at least 16 and moving them all into your 'bag'.  Scroll to the bottom of your 'bag' and exit the 'bag'.  You should be on an inventory screen with no items, including your 'bag'.  You will notice scroll arrows saying you can scroll up or down.  If you scroll down far enough you will find random hidden items.  It is possible to 'move' these items all the way back up to next to your bag.  Using this you can get many of the late game weapons and armor right at the beginning of the game.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Bonus hidden items in your inventory[CR]This glitch can be done at any time, but it works best if you have a fair amount of gold (about 300). From the Castle you start in, head south until you see the sundial, and follow the road eastwards. There are two buildings next to eachother, Iolo's Bows (Run by his apprentice) and a smith to the left of Iolo's Bows. Go to the smith, and buy as much Oil as you can carry. Head to Iolo's bows to the right of the Smith and ask the apprentice about SELL. This will allow you to sell items. The Oil was 4 gold, but you can sell an Oil for 10 gold here, a glitch that allows a profit of 6 gold coins per oil you bought and sold. You end up *more* gold then you had before you bought the Oil.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Guardian appears to the Avatar.[CR]Ultima VII is a top down, Western style role playing game for the PC with a real-time combat system. Released in 1992, Ultima VII is set in the mythical realm of Britannia and features the hero character of the series known as The Avatar. The story takes the Avatar back to Britannia, where 200 years have passed since the events of the previous game, Ultima VI: The False Prophet.[CR]The game was also ported to the Super Nintendo (in 1994) and Mac. The SNES version saw both US and Japan releases. Ultima VII: The Black Gate ends of a cliffhanger that is resolved in Ultima VII Part 2: Serpent Isle. It also received an expansion disk named Forge of Virtue. Ultima VII and its sequel and expansions were also included in numerous Ultima compilations.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]After being contacted through his computer by a mysterious red entity, the Avatar enters the moongate in his backyard and travels through the gate from Earth to Britannia. He finds himself in the town of Trinsic, where a gruesome double murder has taken place. In the process of uncovering the clues towards solving the murders, the Avatar first comes in contact with The Fellowship, a new philosophical organization founded by a druid named Batlin. The Fellowship follow a new doctrine which conflicts with the Eight Virtues enshrined by Lord British, but make a great deal of how they have improved the lives of Britannia's citizens. After leaving Trinsic, the Avatar discovers that the magic users of the world are going crazy, and that the strange material blackrock is somehow connected to it. By following the trail of two of The Fellowship's leaders, the Avatar uncovers the true origins and purpose of the group. After foiling the attempt of the Guardian to invade through the Black Gate, the Avatar finds himself trapped in Britannia and unable to return to Earth.[CR]The Black Gate is the first installment of "The Age of Apocalypse," the final story arc of the main Ultima series. It strikes a darker tone than its predecessors, which becomes apparent when one of the first things the player encounters is a blood-soaked, grisly murder scene. Corruption -- in both political and spiritual forms -- is one of the game's major themes.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]inventory system[CR]Ultima VII features a sophisticated skill and inventory system that allows the player to develop the character in ways that match their playing style. Along the way, the Avatar will meet new NPCs, and old friends from past games who they can invite into their party. While Ultima VII was not the first game in the series to feature mouse support, it was the first to feature a "point and click" user interface as its preferred form of input.[CR]An expansion pack Ultima VII: The Forge of Virtue was released in 1992. It is included in most later releases of the game.[CR]Development[CR]At the time of its release, Ultima VII was known for being very demanding on PC system resources. Contributing to this fact was the game's use of the problematic Voodoo Memory Manager, which was incompatible with other memory managers.EA's Tetrahedron Generator[CR]Ultima VII was the last Ultima game to be published before Origin Systems was bought by Electronic Arts. Like Ultima VI before it, the game included several veiled jabs at EA, as Origin had a tumultuous relationship with the publisher even before the takeover. In the game, the evil Guardian uses three Blackrock Generators to disrupt magic throughout Britannia and broadcast his insidious messages into the minds of its populace. The three generators were built in the shape of a cube, a sphere and a tetrahedron, matching the appearance of the original Electronic Arts logo.[CR]The Super Nintendo port of Ultima VII was severely shortened and simplified, leaving out many of the game's darker elements.[CR]Exult[CR]As Ultima VII is DOS game that is unable to play correctly on Windows XP and beyond, the fan community created a program that allows users to play it on those operating systems. Exult is an emulator designed to allow people who own legitimate copies of Ultima VII to play it on modern operating systems. Development was originally started by Jeff Freedman specifically for the X Window System, hence Ex-Ult. Since it's original development it has been ported across a number of platforms from Windows PCs to Pocket PCs, Linux and OSX.[CR]Exult allows players to play through both the original Ultima VII: The Black Gate (with The Forge of Virtue add on) and the sequel Ultima VII: Serpent Isle (with The Silver Seed add on) campaigns. The developers not only allowed players to relive the experience of Ultima VII but also allowed for changes and tweaks to be added to the game and its interfaces.[CR]One minor interface change that was added to a version of Exult was to give players the option to use the "Paperdoll" inventory system from Serpent Isle in Black Gate. A more recent and larger change was added in the form of craftable items and extra quests. While this required the player download various hacked data files it provided an extension of the original gameplay.[CR]While the Exult project has no official support from EA (the current owners of the Ultima franchise) developers of the original game have shown their support, most notably Richard Garriott, who in a letter to the Exult team wrote:[CR]" Just so that you know. On a personal level I am very excited to see you doing this. Its tough to see games fade out, when the computers or operating systems that run them go away"[CR]Availability[CR]This game is currently available at gog.com and is included in the "Ultima 7 Complete Edition" package.[CR]		</plot>

The first two games in the series are better known in the US as Baseball Simulator 1.000 and Super Baseball Simulator 1.000.[CR]Jitsumeiban means "Real Player Version", due to the game being officially licensed by Nippon Professional Baseball, which allowed them to use actual team and player names. There would eventually be two more Ultra Baseball Jitsumeiban games for the Super Famicom, released in 1994 and 1995.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Sound Test[CR]On the title screen hold L+R and press start</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Umihara Kawase is a 1994 platformer for the Super Famicom that heavily uses physics in its gameplay. The player, as the eponymous heroine Umihara Kawase (her name is actually an abbreviated Japanese proverb concerning the preparation of salt- and freshwater fish, both of which feature heavily in the game as enemies), must navigate through levels with optional goals and alternate exits using only her fishing line. The fishing line can support her weight, and can be attached to sides of platforms and used to swing across gaps or rappel up and down to reach new areas. Umihara can grab onto ledges and pull herself up once she's close enough to the lip, and later levels require trickier maneuvers, using the elasticity of the fishing line to propel Umihara through the air like Spider-Man.[CR]The game's ending is contingent on the amount of total time taken to beat the fiftieth stage. Players can skip ahead by finding harder-to-reach alternate "warp" exits to shave off time, and beating the game within a strict time limit leads to a better ending.[CR]Umihara Kawase saw multiple sequels. A 1997 game for the PlayStation, Umihara Kawase Shun ("Shun" means "in season", continuing the fish/cookery theme), is essentially a graphically enhanced remake. The original Umihara Kawase eventually received a fan translation, though was never officially released outside of Japan.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Hard Mode[CR]On the title screen, press the Select button exactly 100 times. A 5 minute time limit appear in green text next to the start option. If you press Select again, the green text will disappear.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ushio to Tora ("Ushio and Tora") is a game based on the manga of the same name. It features Ushio Aotsuki, a young man who discovers the powerful Beast Spear that his ancestor used to trap a vicious youkai monster called Tora (Japanese for "tiger"). Recovering the spear causes not only Tora to be free, but draws many other evil youkai out from hiding. Tora works begrudgingly with Ushio to fight back the wave of youkai out of fear of the spear's power (though as the manga progresses, Tora's reasons for helping become more altruistic).[CR]The game is a side-scrolling brawler with short stages that culminate in boss fights with other youkai, similar to the Super Famicom GeGeGe no Kitarou game. The player can choose between Ushio and Tora to control, and each controls slightly differently: Ushio has greater range with the spear and can create shockwaves, while Tora is a powerhouse up close with his claws and can summon bolts of lightning.[CR]The game was accompanied by a NES RPG named Ushio to Tora: Shin'en no Daiyu, also published by Yutaka in the same year.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Stage Select[CR]In Option Mode, using controller 2, hold down the following buttons: d-pad down, L, A, and press Select.</plot>

The name Wakataka refers to two famous brothers -- Wakanohana and Takanohana -- who both made Yokozuna rank, the highest ranking for a sumo wrestler.[CR]Unusually for a sumo wrestling game, each match is dictated by a sort of rock-paper-scissors system where two players play their next move from a choice of options, and the next part of the match plays out depending on the moves chosen. If a sumo reaches the edge of the ring, or loses all their stamina, they lose the match. </plot>

			<plot>Rock on! Wizardry is neat little first-person dungeon crawler that first appeared on the Apple ][. It has a very Dungeons &amp; Dragons feel to it, which comes from the basic game play system, and the general "ambiance" of the game.[CR]Anyway, the first three Wizardry Games (Proving Ground of the Mad Overlord, Knight of Diamonds, and Legacy of Llylgamyn) were all ported to the Nes, and were decent as far as Nes first-person games go ;).However, only "Proving grounds," and "Knight of Diamonds" were translated to English, leaving Legacy behind.[CR]Not terribly long ago, these three games were given a bit of a makeover (read: graphics), and re-released for the Snes. The nifty thing is that it was released with both English and Japanese script, with an option to choose which language you'd like.[CR]However, this didn't translate everything, so Gideon picked it up and remedied the situation. He fixed various menus, spell descriptions, and (most importantly) added a lowercase font. In order to set the game to English you *MUST* open the option menu on the screen that appears after you choose which of the three games you're playing, and set all the language options to 'English.' Simple, eh?[CR]Anyway, this games comes highly recommended. You should check it out.[CR]http://www.romhacking.net/trans/496/[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] [CR]A good, but tedious way to gain some money.  If you've ever played this game, you should have noticed that when you create a character, they come with their own little ammount of money.  Since you can pool money to a single character and delete character, you can create create and create character, pool all their money to a single character and delete them and restart.  It's a long and tedious process, but it can get you some money for those expinsive weapons.</plot>

			<title_clean>Wizardry V - Saika no Chuushin</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wizardry V is a first-person, grid-based, RPG that stands as a wholly separate adventure without an arc associated with it. After assembling their party of adventurers, the player will confront many challenges and puzzles as they attempt to penetrate the dangers surrounding the so-called Heart of the Maelstrom stirring beneath a fantastic castle. It should not be confused with the Japanese version of the series which had long since spun off from the main franchise. It was published in October, 1992.[CR]As in all other Wizardry games, Wizardry V is played from a first person 3D perspective. It would be the last game in the series to feature wire-frame dungeon walls, text-only interface design, and static 2D monster portraits although the visuals would be significantly upgraded for its console release on the SNES. On PCs, however, the various game environments are primarily distinguished from each other by (often quite verbose) text descriptions. Similarly, text messages and non-interactive dialogue sequences are used to advance the plot.[CR]The relatively simple and clear interface is organized around a series of commands and actions listed at the bottom of the screen as well as a combined inventory and statistics screen. The original release of the game lacked mouse support but this was later added to subsequent versions.[CR]Wizardry V did not offer an import option for characters/parties created in the first four titles.[CR]Among the other features of the game were:Over 70 spells were available for casting4 basic classes to choose from and four elite classes to upgrade to5 races to create classes with[CR]The game did not have any copy protection and creating a Scenario Diskette was needed in order the game on. The CD-ROM version of the game automatically circumvented this by creating one on the drive when installed.[CR]The manual was also noteworthy for being written in a way that made Wizardry V appear appealing to newcomers with little to no experience with an RPG. Illustrated with humorous drawings and a great deal of detail worked into its text, it also outlined several key monsters/encounters that the party may discover on their trips into the Maze.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Long ages have passed within the Kingdom of Llylgamyn. The evil of Werdna is but legend, the secrets of the Knight of Diamonds long forgotten, and the Mad Overlord has become but a story to scare little children into doing what their parents say. The descendants of the legendary heroes of old have long since disappeared, but the Orb that they had recovered in their last and greatest adventure continues to provide knowledge to those that seek its wisdom. With its revelations on the secrets of life and magic, it spurred much debate and would found a new school of magic organized around what it had shared with those that dared to look into its depths. The Orb was handed to the Brotherhood of Llylgamym for safekeeping and peace reigned throughout the land.[CR]But things began to grow dark once more. Strange weather was the first sign, sickness the next. What was happening? People looked to the orb for help, fearing that it had lost its powers. The High Council was called together behind closed doors. Weeks passed, but with the use of powerful magic and the grace of both the ancient and new gods, they found what they were looking for.[CR]They discovered that the very fabric of reality was coming apart and that the source of this chaos was an unnatural, magical vortex located beneath the Brotherhood's Temple within a maze of caverns and tunnels. It was a place known as the Maelstrom. It had long been a home to foul beasts and the outcasts of the land and there, a great evil now festered threatening not only the land but the entire world. All that we knew may cease to exist if its growth isn't stopped.[CR]They sages of the High Council knew only one answer: to seek the help of a demi-god known as the Gatekeeper. Once a mortal, his power grew to a point where it soon became divine and had inherited the responsibility of watching over and maintaining the balance of magic and the natural world. He might be their only hope, assuming that he would listen to mortals.[CR]But the sages were confident that their call would be answered, so grave was the danger. However, to their utter horror, they learned that the Gatekeeper himself was held prisoner in the heart of the very vortex they wished him to destroy! Terrified, the Sages turned ot the Brotherhood whose knowledge of the mystical and magical exceeded their own. Here, a tale of evil and treachery was scried by Brother Drew, High Prophet of the Brotherhood.[CR]They learned of a renegade Brother, a woman named the Sorn, whose wish it is to end all order in the universe. She had discovered a means to create an ever-growing rift in reality...the very vortex that now threatens the land. From this destruction will come a new universe where chaos will reign and the world will no longer exist. It was she who trapped the Gatekeeper and made him prisoner. She must be stopped lest everyone perish in her madness.[CR]It has been three years since these events were discovered and the vortex continues to grow. Time is growing short. Two of the most powerful sages in the kingdom, Fontizan and the High Sage Yeldarb have begun to seek warriors brave enough to enter the caverns beneath the Temple of the Brotherhood, find the Gatekeeper, and free him from the vortex. However, they must first defeat the evil Sorn.[CR]In order to even have a chance, the adventurers must first seek out G'bli Gedook, the High Priest of the Brotherhood. He is the guardian of the Orb of Llylgamym and resides in the first layer of the caverns just under the temple. From there, they must descend into the depths of the Maze and battle whatever the Sorn can conjure up to stop them.[CR]After many battles and adventures, a party did achieve the impossible and confronted the Sorn deep below the Temple. By closing the Triaxial Gate which was the source of the rift and calling forth the Gatekeeper, they destroyed the shield that had protected the Sorn and its minions. In the battle that followed, the Sorn was ultimately defeated and the Triaxial Balance restored.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Wizardry V is a tile or grid based movement, first-person RPG set in a mysterious Castle that serves as the base for party management and the Maze in which the adventure takes place. Party size is limited to six members, although smaller parties are even allowed but not suggested for survival. The player must find penetrate the dangers and mysteries of the Maze in order to stop the nefarious Sorn dwelling within the Heart of the Maelstrom. But, in order to do, the party must also negotiate the Maze and deal with its dangerous inhabitants as well as solve the puzzles that stand in their way.[CR]The Maze comprises the central theater for the adventure and is comprised of several levels, each with its own distinct dangers and puzzles to solve. The lack of an automap (which had yet to become a standard feature of RPGs at the time of W6's release) means that the player is required to draw his or her own maps or otherwise rely on unofficial game guides and walkthroughs in order to navigate the mazelike multi-level dungeon.[CR]Saves could only be made anywhere, but Wizardry V's setup on PCs had an additional side-benefit to doing so. It would allow players to quick-save their progress and quit out of the scenario and if they chose to start at the Castle with a fresh party, they could wander back into the Maze and even encounter their old party where they had left them.[CR]Levels were earned after gaining the requisite experience as well as resting at the Inn back at the Castle. It was possible to continue adventuring well after the previous experience limit was met and earning several levels at once after a restful stay at the Inn.The Castle[CR]This was the central location for the player's management options concerning their party. Here, several locations were available by hotkey:Gilgamesh's Tavern - A dim and smoke filled place with a perpetual haunch of boar roasting over the fire, small groups of adventurers congregate here discussing their latest exploits or hoping to join a party. This is where the player will build their party from characters they create.Adventurer's Inn - Rest is offered as long as the party can afford their stay. Several different rooms are provided ranging from the Stables to a Royal Suite, each with their own rate of healing. This is also where resting characters can level up once they have the requisite experience.Temple of Cant - More severe ailments are handled here, again for the right 'donation'. Paralysis, poison, and even the dead can be brought back to a sense of normalcy after enough coins are shared with the faithful. Boltac's Trading Post - A friendly dwarf named Boltac operates this in the Castle's market area, providing his services to anyone that can afford them. Arms, goods, and even his experience in identifying certain items can all be purchased with the right coin. The party can even sell their ill gotten gains here to free up their pockets for even more loot that they might come across. Boltac can even remove cursed items, although the party will also lose the item once it's "uncursed."Edge of Town - From here, the party can visit the Training Grounds, enter the Maze, or head back to the Castle.The Maze - Many adventurers seeking fame, glory, and experience eagerly dive into the dangers of the Maze. Other adventurers, monsters, and even a few riddles await them here as they head ever deeper into the depths in search of evil.Training Grounds - New characters are created here and players can also inspect older characters to see if they need a few changes of their own.Character Interaction[CR]Not every monster wants to stick the party's heads on a pike and some might even be very helpful. When these NPCs (non-player characters) are encountered, the party have several options that they can explore. They can talk to them which brings up a text parser for inquiries to made with, similar to that found in interactive fiction.[CR]The player can also barter with them if they have anything to sell, or if they want to buy something from the party. The party can also opt to give them something for free in order to get onto their good side. Stealing is also another option and a charm spell can also be cast to help them see the party in a better light. Or, if the player wants, they can just opt to fight and kill whoever they had been having a nice conversation with. The player just needs be sure they can live with the consequences, or have enough coin to resurrect them with once they've had their fun.Puzzles[CR]Wizardry V's puzzles were focused primarily around riddles and items that were needed to get by certain obstacles. Most notable was its maze-like dungeon with many random encounters thrown in for good measure.[CR]Picking Locks and Disarming Traps[CR]Picking locks was as simple as having a Thief (or a mage with the proper spell) in the party to do so depending on their expertise. Disarming traps, especially on treasure chests, was much more different. A character with the proper skill could inspect the chest and determine what kind of trap was on it. Once they made their assessment, it was up to the player to disarm the trap by opting to do so and then typing the trap's name in. If they are correct, the trap is disarmed.Camping[CR]This command allowed the party to camp out in the middle of the dungeon. This also enabled the player to inspect their party members and also re-order their party's marching order. This also allows the player to equip their entire party at once if they so choose.Swimming[CR]There are magical pools that the party can dive into in order to discover anything of worth within their depths. Characters will learn the art of swimming over time and with enough experience in diving into pools.[CR]Special Monsters[CR]Wizardy V also came with a pamphlet outlining several special encounters within the Maze complete with illustrations showing what they looked like. These NPCs could provide the player with clues, special items, or simply challenge the party with death.IronoseHe operates the local Maze Mart. He can be found bartering his goods, buying others gems, and battling an adventurer or two on the first level of the Maelstrom. He boasts "The Best Dungeon Prices" and comes in handy to adventurers in need. He determined that there was a place for a "Shop" in the Maze and that's where it first began. Business was slow at first, he only sold a few potions to Ice Phantoms and weapons to fighters, but gradually through word of mouth and an intense grafitti effort, business picked up. He's a well trained fighter, but friendly. After all, the customer is always right (well, most of the time!).The Laughing KettleBelieve it or not, there's actually a land where Kettles roam freely (if that's what Kettles do), the motherland of Fymia. It is the origin of The Laughing Kettle.Back in his homeland, he was well-educated, respected and loved. However, tension eventually grew as the Kettle began to spout information no one understood time after time. His one-time friends talked behind his back; "He thinks he knows it all!" Actually, the Kettle was only trying to help them. The taunting continued, and he decided he had heard enough. It was time to leave this blessed soil to head for the Maelstrom... with a bang. And a bang it was! Granted, it wasn't the right thing to do. No one remained. He laughs today at this event, and likely will laugh tomorrow.The Kettle has been around the Maelstrom for years, and despite his laughter, his wisdom is great. He's still your everyday "know-it-all." Manfretti's "Adventure getting you down? Combat's just not going as well as you had planned? Come to Manfretti's, the fun center of the Maelstrom." That's what the graffiti said. But there is more to Manfretti's, both in fun and in lore, than meets the eye.There you'll find things to delight your senses, thrill your spirit, and warm your heart. It was all created for you by the magical Manfretti, a man who had a love for life and a first-rate sense of humor. He realized that once in awhile even the best needed a break, and so he and a group of his female associates carved from the rock within the Maze until he had created room for his fun center. It took the Manfretti and the five women years of work. When they finished, Manfretti smiled at their achievements and planned for more.Saying good-bye to the ladies, off he went in search of more "fun things to do." Time went by, but he never returned, and to this day, Manfretti's whereabouts are unknown. Yet the ladies he left behind continue on his dream; they keep the fun center alive, all the while hoping for his return. When you visit, and I am sure you will, you may meet one of them, and you should meet all. Ye Dragon's Flagon [CR]If only these walls could talk, what a story they would tell. From far and near, the weary, dwarf fighters who inhabit the Maze come to the Dragon's Flagon in search of the three R's: rest, relaxation and rye.[CR]It's truly an interesting place. Somehow those little fingers have managed to disguise the bar. You won't find it... ever; it's their private reserve (with all profits channelled back to the five dwarfs in the Flagon's membership, of course). It was established in 674 b.m. (before Maelstrom) to honor the much beloved and huge Dragon of Bhjimo, who carried her likewise huge flagon everywhere. After her death at the hand of Yetteje, a robust samurai, the dwarf fighters dragged the flagon to its current, undisclosed location.[CR]Should you happen upon this place, you can almost always find one of the dwarfs willing to talk if you've got the ear to listen. They have been around the maze, and might be able to offer something of value. But occasionally, adventure calls the dwarf fighters, so be prepared to make several return visits.[CR]The Togo Llama No one can pass up a gaze at this breathtaking creature. Imagine a llama in a toga. It's not an everyday sight, nor is this an everyday animal.[CR]Many, many years ago a clan of llamas roamed the plains of Lytricidickydo. The plains were sizzling hot, but the llamas had adapted to this environment fairly well. Then one day an adventurer by the name of Nalla Orman came along, bartering his goods.[CR]"I have here the most wondeful item. It's something you need to stop that blasted heat. I'll sell you this exclusive designer toga for only 5000 gold pieces. You won't find another one like it anywhere!"[CR]And so he went on... and on... and on. Eventually the llamas bought his story and his togas. Whether they did it just to shut him up, no one knows. Nonetheless, they followed him back to the Castle and into the dungeons where the air was cool and the living was easy. Hence is the story of the Toga Llama.[CR]The Ruby WarlockThe lore of the Ruby Warlock goes back quite a ways. It seems he's been around forever. In his younger years, he was quite a gem. He practiced spells every day, and looked forward to the time when he, like those before him, could walk the lower levels proud and unafraid. However, the spirits got him. Bottled spirits, that is. He can be seen asking passers-by for a sip. Of course, the creatures of the Maze look upon The Ruby Warlock with pity, and help him when they can. He's not really a bad fellow, just a Warlock who fell by the wayside.He still remains a fairly laid-back individual, unless provoked. As "Warlock" would imply, he is chock-full of magical power! So take care in your words and your actions.The Ghosts' Nest So you've never seen a ghost. You will likely see one of yourself if you're not careful. Yes, this is the legendary Ghosts' Nest, home to those who have refused to accept the fact that... well... they are dead.The whereabouts of this dwelling are unknown, even to me. But I have been told on more than one occasion that it is not a place for the meek. Even the strongest, they say, will perish underneath the vapory fingers of its inhabitants. Unfortunately, it's likely that there is a ghost on duty at all times, so a "pleasure stroll" is out of the question.I found once an old scroll in the dust of the Maze; I know not why I tell you. It may be of no matter. The parchment was badly soiled, and the words were nearly gone. I could decipher part of its tale: "Death awaits, gold comes, terror abounds... from the three, straight to thee..." The Den of Thieves Banned from virtually every corner of the Maelstrom is the troop of bandits who shelter at the Den of Thieves. The poor souls are misunderstood outcasts in their own Maze. They're really a nice crew (as long as you keep your stuff secure). However, they are a bit hard to find.Throughout the years they've managed to assemble a lot of items stolen from various, fool-hearty adventurers. Swords, shields, bows, potions... you name it. Naturally, in order to protect themselves, they needed a good hiding spot. Three of the thieves were certain that a room deep within the caverns would be the perfect spot. However, another member of their guild reminded the ambitious members that monsters (and he meant monsters) lived in those depths. Finally, the wisest of them all announced his plan to the agreement of the rest. The Den was to be established in an area where no light shown. It was hoped you would never find the door.Try, hard, adventurer! For as they pick your pockets, you can pick their minds. As sneaky as they are, a word or two not meant for their ears may have been heard. Check in on them often for the latest gossip. The Hurkle Beast [CR]Lurking and stalking, working and talking are the traits of the infamous Hurkle Beast. He is the last of the Hurkeniskon species, all of whom "hurkle" often. If you should hear the chant while traversing the caverns, it's likely this chap is nearby.[CR]A few brave adventures of times past captured the Hurkle Beast and encaged him in a box. None thought his escape was possible. However, the box proved too weak for the creature, and his breakout was natural. In tatters, the cage still remains, but the Hurkle Beast roams free.[CR]Unfortunately, the Hurkle Beast can't figure out how to leave the area to return to his homeland, Hurkazownia. So, here he remains.[CR]The SnatchThe Snatch is a crafty little thief who hangs out at Manfretti's. As with most thieves, The Snatch has overheard many conversations. And, like those in his profession, he can't keep a secret very well.[CR]The Snatch began his career rather slowly, but then inspiration struck. He applied for membership at the Den of Thieves. Virtually a novice in his profession, he hoped that the members would teach him a thing or two. If not, he'd simply take it. Within two weeks, his application had been unanimously DENIED. He passed none of the stealing tests and got caught three times attempting to steal information. Yet, he passed the important tests; that is, those tests important to The Snatch! He stole "The Thieves Handbook" from the Den, the member's ideas and their trade secrets to boot. He never wanted membership; he only wanted all they had to give.[CR]GwylionThey never intended to be the way they are. Not so long ago, they were friendly, light-hearted individuals. Now, they roam the Maze, bent on the revenge of an unknown cause. Everyone who greets them is subjected to attack and only rarely will they offer the party a truce.[CR]The story of their transformation is unknown, but the Gwylion's change occurred shortly after it was declared that Manfretti was missing. Some speculate that the girls loved Manfretti; others, such as I, believe it was jealousy of those who enjoyed his company. When Manfretti was around, they would listen to his jokes and stories for hours on end. After his disappearance, their visits lessened, and gradually ended. They may still search for him today.[CR]Feel sorrow for these poor beasts, but not enough to render yourself open to their attacks. Surely, they will show you no mercy. [CR]Character Development[CR]The player can opt to start with the batch of pre-made character provided for them by the game or create their own.Age[CR]Characters can actually age in Wizardry V if they rest too much. Resting at the Inn can last anywhere from a single day to a year depending on how much gold the player has in reserve. Resting replenishes a party's health and stamina, readying them for the road ahead, but rest enough times and a character will start to age. But when they first start out in the game, they are at an extremely young age. Death by old age is hardly expected, but it is a possibility.Classes[CR]The character classes belong to one of two categories; Base or Elite. Base classes (Fighter, Mage, Priest, Thief) are often considered the 'starting' class for a character whereas Elite classes (Lord, Bishop, Samurai, Lord, Ninja) typically benefit from having better fighting skills and eventual proficiency in magic. The initial statistics requirements for Elite classes are noticably higher than for the Base classes, making the former much more difficult to create at the start of the game.[CR]As with quite a few RPGs, Wizardry V includes the option to change character class during the course of the game at the Training Grounds when inspecting a character. The incentives to do so in Wizardry V are comparatively strong as many abilities are retained from the original classes, and since characters who recently changed classes during mid-game can often gain levels rapidly (thus enabling the player to raise skill points and fill out spell books much faster than would otherwise have been possibly).[CR]Alignment largely determines what kind of class a particular character can be.[CR]The four basic classes are:Fighter - High hit points and experts at using any weapon and piece of armor, they are a grounded class that can dish out the damage as well as take it.Thief - No party is complete without a thief who can pick locks and disarm traps. While they aren't the greatest of fighters, they rely on their sneakiness to backstab their enemies.Priest - Long known as skilled healers, their talents are important for any party heading out into danger. They can also dispel the undead. They cannot be of neutral alignment.Mage - The classic wizard. As they become more powerful, their spellbooks will continue to add many new pages filled with deadly spells. [CR]The four elite classes are: Bishop - Like a Priest, they are able to heal their friends and dispel the undead. They are also able to uncurse items that become permanently stuck to a character, freeing them. They can also learn any spell from any of the other schools. The downside is that their learning rate is also a bit slower, so the selection of spells that they may have will take more time to develop. But with their uncurse ability, they're nigh indispensible. They must not be neutral.Samurai - A true swordsman. At the fourth level of experience, they begin to learn Mage spells. They cannot be of evil alignment because of their adherence to the code of Bushido.Lord - Skilled as a fighter as well as being pious enough to cast a few spells, they are likened to paladins and crusader knights. They start learning priestly spells around the fourth level of experience. They can also only be of good alignment.Ninja - An assassin and a rogue, they can kill with weapons or their bare hands, sometimes being able to kill the strongest enemy with a single blow. They disdain armor and become far harder to hit and tougher to kill as they gain levels. They also have all of the skills of thief and are able to disarm traps. They can also hide in shadows and ambush enemies. They must also be of evil alignment.Races[CR]The races include familiar fantasy characters such as the Elf, the Dwarf, the Gnome and the Hobbit.Humans - Balanced without any serious flaws, a good, even keeled race that can belong and excel at any profession.Elf - They excel at the intellectual classes, such as Mages, or Bishops. Keenly interested in study.Dwarf - Gruff, short in stature, but tough and reliable, dwarves make excellent Fighters while their piety can also find them a career as a Priest.Gnomes - Found underground and often overlooked by the larger races, their quiet and studious nature make them ideal as Mages or Priests.Hobbit - Friendly, nimble, and otherwise unassuming, they make surprisingly decent Ninja, Samurai, or Thieves.Statistics[CR]Attribute scores had a maximum value of 18 and determined a variety of effects and class eligibility requirements. Many of these attributes were particularly important across many classes across a variety of skills. Characters can improve their attributes thanks to the investment of points earned with every level.Strength - Determines how much damage a character can lay into a monster as well as how much weight they can carry around with them. It also affects certain weapon skills and plays into staminaI.Q. - Important for spellcasters.Piety - This is important for a character's ability to concentrate on the task at hand. It also affects how many spells a character may be able to learn and their effectiveness with them.Vitality - Very important for hit points, the chance for resurrection, the ability to resist damage and disease, and general health.Luck - Ambiguous but it also has mysterious effects on many other factors[CR]As with many RPGs, character development was driven by experience points which translated into levels. When a character gains a level after resting an an inn:Spellcasters may be able to learn a new spellDepending on their statistics, a character may even change their classHit points will also improve[CR]Combat[CR]Combat in Wizardry V was a turn based affair with random encounters providing the cannon fodder that would feed the party's thirst for experience points. When enemies encountered the party, a list of enemies along with a picture showing what they were onscreen.[CR]Similar to other RPGs of the era, its strict turn-based system halts the passage of time until the player performs an action (such as moving around or casting spells). In combat, the order in which characters act is determined primarily by their speed statistics, although the player issues orders to every character in the party before commencing a turn. Besides using melee and/or ranged weapons and casting spells, characters with the appropriate skills can hide (which means enemies cannot hurt them), use items in their inventory, equip new weapons or items or try to run away from battle which, if successful, results in the entire party fleeing from the enemies. It is not possible to save the game or restore a saved game while in combat mode, but there are no other restrictions on when and where the player can save the game.[CR]In each round of combat, everyone makes their selection of actions as the game calculates who will have initiative and then executing their orders. When several groups of monsters are encountered, the player is able to pick out who the targets are from the generated list shown onscreen.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The FM Towns version featured enhanced CD quality music.By this point, the Wizardry series was so popular in Japan, an anime spin-off was created.[CR]				</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Wrecking Crew '98 is the sequel to the NES game Wrecking Crew. Wrecking Crew '98 was released in Japan on the Super Famicom on May 23, 1998. The game introduced several new features, as well as adding new characters. The game's story involves the fact that Bowser begins a large construction campaign. This is depriving the Mushroom Kingdom (and its inhabitants) of sunlight, so Mario decides to destroy the constructions. Foreman Spike, Gotcha Wrench, and Eggplant Man from Wrecking Crew all return to stop Mario on this quest.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]What the typical gameplay screen looks like.[CR]The gameplay of Wrecking Crew '98 is very similar to the original game. Panels are eliminated by smashing them with the hammer, or by getting three of the same colored panels in a row (either vertically or horizontally). After playing for a little bit, brick panels begin falling in. These panels are covered in brick, so they require one smash to show their color. More brick panels appear the longer the match goes on. Four panels in a row of the same color create an obstacle for the opponent. Various panels do different attacks on the opponent.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]MarioLuigiBowserForeman SpikeGotcha WrenchKoopa TroopaPeachEggplant ManOnigiriOnnanokoOyajiDogu[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] New Levels[CR]To get new levels do the following things: </plot>

They face off against walkers and tanks before eventually taking down the master computer end boss.[CR]X-Zone is one of a handful of SNES games that takes advantage of the Super Scope peripheral, which is required to play the game. As with its Super Scope contemporaries Bazooka Blitzkrieg and Battle Clash, the game is a light-gun rail shooter filled with futuristic robots and vehicles to shoot down.[CR]Critical Reception[CR]Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded X-Zone scores of 7,8,8,8 adding, "...the action is non-stop from the start and you really need to keep calm throughout each level. Only patience can win this game, as rockets come at you from every angle!".[CR]	</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi is a strategy game based on the anime and manga of the same name by manga artist Yokoyama Mitsuteru. The name simply means "Yokoyama Mitsuteru's version of Sangokushi", Sangokushi being the Japanese name for the Chinese literary classic Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The manga and anime retell the story of the book, with the game focused on this retelling.[CR]During the game's development the anime adaptation was in full swing, so the game was very much intended to be a companion piece. This was a standard practice of Bandai at the time (Angel was a game publisher subsidiary of the toy giant), as was hiring freelance developers like TOSE to develop for them.[CR]The game is a standard turn-based strategy war sim in the vein of Koei's much more prolific Romance of the Three Kingdoms series. The player and the AI-controlled rival kingdoms select actions that include diplomacy, combat and domestic matters such as farming and trade, with the ultimate goal being to wrest control over the rest of China from the other two kingdoms.[CR]The game was followed up with two sequels: a standard sequel in Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi II and the board game spin-off Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi Bangi.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi II ("Mitsuteru Yokoyama's Romance of the Three Kingdoms II") is a strategy game and the sequel to the original Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi. Both games were adapted from the eponymous manga artist's graphic novel adaptation of the ancient Chinese novel. Specifically, they were based on an anime adaptation of the manga, released close to the same time.[CR]The second game presents three new scenarios and does away with the month-specific actions of the original, allowing the player to perform any action on their turn. It's also been graphically updated. It is still superficially similar to Koei's better known Romance of the Three Kingdoms series of strategy sims.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi Bangi: Sugoroku Eiyuuki is a sugoroku board game spin-off of the Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi strategy series. It plays similarly to the Dokapon series: the player, as one of the major warlords of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms (called Sangokushi in Japan), must move around a board taking territory and fighting in one-on-one battles with NPC bandits and soldiers. Other squares on the board lead to various events that change the player's status or help/hinder them in other ways.[CR]Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi Bangi is based on manga artist Mitsuteru Yokoyama's acclaimed historical manga that retells the Romance of the Three Kingdoms story. However, characters are drawn in a more comedic super deformed style to highlight that the game is a less serious offshoot.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Jetsons: Invasion of the Planet Pirates is a 2D scrolling platformer featuring George Jetson and other characters from the 1960s Hanna Barbera cartoon property. George is tasked by Captain Zoom (his son Elroy's favorite comic book hero) to use a Pneumo Osmatic Precipitator (or POP, a vacuum-like device) to deter an alien invasion by the SPREE (Space Pirates Reveling in Evil Enterprises). Most of the level design centers around the pneumatic properties of the POP device, which allows George to climb walls, throw blocks around, swing across ceilings and breathe underwater.[CR]The game was developed by Sting Entertainment, a Japanese developer better known for unusual tactical RPGs like Yggdra Union and Knights in the Nightmare, and originally published by Taito for the US in mid-1994.[CR]In 1995 video game and magazine publishers Kadokawa Shoten commissioned Sting to create a platformer based on their Marukatsu Super Famicom magazine's mascot character, Yokai Buster Ruka-chan, and Sting's pre-existing Jetsons game received a graphical overhaul to fit the new license. It is a rare case of an existing licensed game being changed for Japanese audiences rather than for Western audiences - as was the case for Yo! Noid, Ninja Kid, Dragon Power, Chubby Cherub, Cratermaze and others, all of which were based on Japanese manga/anime licenses that wouldn't have been recognizable in the US and Europe at the time.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Health Refill (The Jetsons: Invasion of the Planet Pirates)[CR]Pause the game and enter in the code.If you entered it correctly, it will be confirmed by making George Jetson grunt, and take effect after unpausing.You can only use the refill code once per screen, you may use it again when you reach the next screen, or restart the current screen.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Health Refill (The Jetsons: Invasion of the Planet Pirates)[CR]Pause the game and press in order the following buttons:[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Health Refill (The Jetsons: Invasion of the Planet Pirates)[CR]Pause the game and press in order the following buttons:[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Health Refill (The Jetsons: Invasion of the Planet Pirates)[CR]Pause the game and press in order the following buttons:[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Health Refill (The Jetsons: Invasion of the Planet Pirates)[CR]Go to the "Options" mode.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ys IV: Mask of the Sun was developed by Tonkin House and was released for the Super Famicom on November 19, 1993. There are two games called Ys IV that were released in 1993: Mask of the Sun and Dawn of Ys by Hudson. Falcom had no hand in the development of either game except that they came up with the basic plot outline that each developer followed. Although Dawn of Ys is a fan favorite, Mask of the Sun is considered to be the "canonical" fourth entry in the Ys franchise since it was released before Dawn of Ys and was published by Falcom. However, a true Falcom developed Ys IV was created decades later for the Playstation Vita in 2012 under the name Ys: Memories of Celceta. Taito Corporation also developed a remake of Mask of the Sun called Ys IV: Mask of the Sun - A New Theory for the PS2 in 2005.A patch was released for Ys IV: Mask of the Sun by Aeon Genesis on February 7, 2005 that translated all of the game's text into English.[CR]	</plot>

			<title_clean>Yu Yu Hakusho</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]YuYu Hakusho is a Super Famicom game based on the horror-themed manga and anime about a belligerent young man who dies unexpectedly from being hit by a car and is revived as a "spirit detective" by the rulers of the afterlife, and it becomes his job to investigate ghostly matters in the mortal world. The game is a series of set-piece battles where two opponents build up gauges using the D-pad and one of the face buttons: each combination leads to a separate attack and requires a different amount of build-up. The player can go through the story mode, which recounts events from the manga, or they can play a "free" mode against opponents of their choice.[CR]The game is the first of four YuYu Hakusho games for the Super Famicom, all of which were developed and published by Namco. The second (YuYu Hakusho 2: Kakutou no Sho) and fourth (YuYu Hakusho Final: Makai Saiky&#333; Retsuden) games are standard one-on-one fighter games featuring numerous playable characters from the series. The third game (YuYu Hakusho: Tokubetsu Hen) is a lot like the first, using a similar battle system.[CR]Though they have identical names, this particular YuYu Hakusho is not to be confused with the 1993 Game Boy YuYu Hakusho game, nor the 1994 3DO YuYu Hakusho game.[CR]	</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]YuYu Hakusho: Tokubetsu Hen ("YuYu Hakusho: Special Edition") is a fighter game for the Super Famicom. Rather than controlling the character directly with the D-pad and buttons, the players charge attacks and unleash them at the right amount of power. Combat is depicted as a series of dramatic cutaways as each fighter launches their attacks and the other tries to defend or evade them.[CR]YuYu Hakusho, an anime series about a teenage delinquent that is recruited by the underworld to fight demons and spirits that have escaped into the normal world, saw multiple adaptations for the Super Famicom and other consoles. Most are straightforward fighter games, though this and its predecessor YuYu Hakusho use this timing-based variant.

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]YuYu Hakusho 2: Kakutou no Sho is the second of four Namco-developed Super Famicom adaptations of the YuYu Hakusho manga and anime, featuring the delinquent student Yusuke who becomes a spirit world investigator after he passes away. While its predecessor, YuYu Hakusho, featured a combat system that was turn-based and tactical, Kakutou no Sho is instead a standard example of the four-button fighter game model that became popular after the success of Capcom's Street Fighter II.[CR]The game is set during the Dark Tournament arc of the TV anime adaptation, considered the second season of the show, during which Yusuke and his companions take part in a competitive fighting tournament for demons. It features ten playable characters and an additional four secret unlockable characters, which are actually just variations of other characters that appear during the storyline.Playable Fighters[CR]The first ten playable characters are unlocked from the offset for the game's battle mode (the single-player story mode limits which character the player can use, but will often provide a choice). The following four, marked with an asterisk (*), are secret characters that need to be unlocked with codes before they become accessible in the multiplayer mode.Yusuke Urameshi: The series protagonist. A delinquent who is resurrected after an altruistic sacrifice and recruited to become a Reikai Tantei, or "spirit world detective", to deal with supernatural elements that cross over to the human world. Plays similarly to Ryu, combining distance and close attacks.Kazuma Kuwabara: Yusuke's rival and fellow tough guy student. Limited combat prowess and psychic ability, but very durable.Kurama: A fox demon who recuperated in the soul of a pregnant human woman and was born as her child, Shuichi. Lost much of his demonic powers as a human, but retains his skill and cunning.Hiei: A fire demon with a mop of black hair that conceals his third eye: a "Jagan eye" he had installed to become more powerful.Genkai: An elderly martial artist that is Yusuke's mentor and martial arts instructor. Strong despite her age, and can channel vast forces of energy. She can end up temporarily de-aged after using her strongest attack, which requires her to be in her strongest form.Suzaku: A former nemesis of Yusuke's, and leader of the band of demons known as the Four Beasts. Can split into seven different forms when fighting.Chuu: A mohawked demon that loves to drink and practices a Drunken Fist style. Jin: An easygoing demon who loves to fight. He is a ninja with mastery over the winds.Shishiwakamaru: An androgynous swordsman who is in actuality a small imp-like demon. Uses a katana that can channel the spirits of the dead. Togura 30%: A large and muscular human who is secretly a demon. Became a demon by choice after other demonic forces destroyed his dojo, realizing he didn't have the strength to stop them as a human. Was at one time Genkai's romantic partner, and the two of them won a previous Dark Tournament together. The 30% refers to the amount of power he allows himself to use, as there are consequences for releasing too much at once.*Fukumen Senshi: Simply Genkai in her disguised form, which she uses to enter the Dark Tournament incognito to seek out Togura. Fights in a similar way to Genkai, but with a few hidden talents.*Shoujo Genkai: A.k.a. "young woman Genkai", the de-aged version of Genkai who is even faster. Both she and Fukumen Senshi are alternate forms of Genkai that can be unlocked for the multiplayer.*Togura 80%: A version of Togura that has released more of his power, becoming considerably stronger.*Togura 100%: A version of Togura at maximum power, which also makes him appear far more demonic. In this form his strength and defense are considerably higher.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Alternate Credits Screen[CR]Beat Story Mode without losing any match.

Like its 1993 contemporary Yuujin: Janjyu Gakuen, it heavily features the artwork of anime artist U-Jin, best known for his eroge manga (though the game itself does not contain any pornographic material).[CR]Every turn each character rolls a dice that moves them that many spaces around the board. Along the way they will find cash, new weapons, health pick-ups and other items. They will also encounter monsters, and must beat them in janken (rock-scissor-paper) matches to remove them from the board. The goal for every player is to defeat the monster that holds the key to the exit, and then reach the exit with the key. The player can choose between four heroines, each with different starting stats/cash.</plot>

			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Zan II: Spirits is the first Super Famicom game in Wolf Team's series of strategy sims set in historical Japan. It was eventually followed up with a sequel, Zan III: Spirits.[CR]As with its thematically-similar contemporaries, like Shingen the Ruler or Nobunaga's Ambition, Zan II puts the player in the geta of a Japanese feudal lord, or daimyo, with designs to wrest control over the rest of Japan from the other daimyos. The game is more focused on warfare than day-to-day resource management, with armies of samurai marching across the map to attack fortresses and pagodas that host enemy flags.[CR]	</plot>

Zan III is also the second in the Zan series to be released on the Super Famicom: most of the Zan series only appeared on Japanese home computers like the PC-9801 and FM Towns. The player is once again asked to lead the armies of their chosen daimyo (warlord) in an effort to conquer the rest of 16th century Japan.[CR]Zan III Spirits is an adaptation of Zan III: Tenun Ware ni Ari for the PC-9801, which was originally released in December 1993 four months prior. Zan III Spirits, like its SFC predecessor Zan II Spirits, was modified for its console release to make it work with the limitations/strengths of the system.</plot>

Once your arm has been raised, IMMEDIATELY press any of the ATTACK (z,x,y etc...) or DIRECTIONAL  (up, down, left...) buttons on the D Pad to break away from the Referee's grasp. If inputted correctly, your Wrestler will be able to resume taunting and fighting against your defeated opponent.[CR][B][B][B]Cheat:[/B][/B][/B] Fill the Budokan Arena.[CR]To fill the Budokan Arena, choose to participate in "Start" mode as your first priority. The amount of people in the audience depends on the quality of the matches that are set up throughout the night and the performance of each wrestler from match to match. As you play through "Start" mode, aim to pull off finishing moves, specialty attacks, taunts and near pins (close pins with counts ranging from 2.5-2.9) as your main strategy. You can monitor the crowd's reaction by the volume of their cheers,(when attempting a pinfall) the stamping of their feet and the amount of people in the Arena from each match onwards. At the end of the show you will be rewarded with a special message from the game's main booker ..Giant Baba who will evaluate your performance based on the shows that you have booked.</plot>

			<title_clean>Zico Soccer</title_clean>
			<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Zico Soccer is a 1994 soccer simulation game featuring the likeness of famous mononymmed Brazilian soccer player Zico. Rather than controlling the soccer players directly, the player acts as the lead coach and must direct the soccer players on the field with the mouse cursor. They can tell specific players where to go, when to shoot and to whom to pass. The game uses the SNES Mouse peripheral.[CR]The game features international sides, with the single exception of the Japanese league team the Kashima Antlers, for whom Zico was playing at the time. The player can choose to play single exhibition matches or in a cup tournament.[CR]The game was a Super Famicom exclusive. Despite the international sports focus, and the likeness of a foreign soccer star, it remained Japan-only. It uses the name of EA Sports, but was actually created by EA Victor: a joint venture between Electronic Arts and the Japanese game company Victor Entertainment.Teams[CR]It featured the following national teams:Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) - An international team created for Euro 1992 comprised of former Soviet Union states.DenmarkMoroccoJapanBrazilSpainBelgiumUnited States of AmericaFranceNorwayNigeriaRomaniaNetherlandsCameroonSwitzerlandMexicoArgentinaItalyColombiaGreeceWest GermanySwedenBoliviaSouth KoreaKashima Antlers</plot>

			<plot>Restoring the lands from evil, saving the princess, and finding a way back home might not be the most original of goals, but how many games also include the comedy stylings of Japanese performance group Dachou Club? Not many, that's for sure![CR]Zig Zag Cat is an unusual fusion of Breakout and a scrolling shooter. During action stages the player's avatar walks forward while attempting to keep their cat from bouncing off the bottom of the screen. The cat can break most obstacles by hitting them, and all obstacles will be broken if they collide with the avatar. By breaking blocks money and temporary paddle upgrades can be uncovered, such as ones that increase the size or the paddle, let you fire bullets, or allow you to curve the cat while it is moving. Several times during each stage a black octopus block will appear, and it must be destroyed by the cat before the player's avatar will continue moving forward. While the avatar is totally unharmed from walking through any enemies or blocks, some enemies and all bosses have the ability to fire projectiles at him which do cause damage, and if all health is lost from projectiles then a life will be lost just as if the cat had fallen off the screen.[CR]In between action stages the player will enter an Inn. At the Inn he can save, talk to the locals, play a bonus board to earn additional money, buy temporary paddle upgrades, and check his progress on his trip around the island.</plot>
