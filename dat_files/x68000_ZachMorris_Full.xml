			<emu_comment>Sharp x68000 List by Zach Morris.  This is the FULL UNFILTERED list of games available from the archive.[CR]The X68000 is a home computer created by Sharp Corporation, first released in 1987, sold only in Japan. In terms of hardware, it is very similar to arcade machines of the time, and serves as the Capcom CPS system development machine. It supports separate text RAM, graphic RAM and hardware sprites. Sound is produced internally via Yamaha's then top-of-the-line YM2151 FM synthesizer and a single channel OKI MSM6258V for PCM. Due to this and other similarities, it played host to many arcade game ports in its day. Games made for this system include Parodius Da! －Shinwa kara Owarai e－, Ghouls 'n Ghosts, Strider, Final Fight, Alien Syndrome, Street Fighter II Dash, Akumajo Dracula (Castlevania in other regions, the X68000 version was ported to the PlayStation as Castlevania Chronicles), Cho Ren Sha 68k (which has a Windows port) and many others. Many games also supported the Roland SC-55 and MT-32 MIDI modules for sound as well as mixed-mode internal/external output.[CR]Developer:  Sharp Corporation[CR]Manufacturer:  Sharp Corporation[CR]CPU:  Hitachi HD68HC000 10 MHz[CR]Memory:  12 MB[CR]Graphics:  256 × 240[CR]Sound:  Yamaha YM2151, OKI MSM6258[CR]Media:  Floppy[CR]Max Controllers:  2</emu_comment>

				<plot>Players take the role of a rapist. If a man gives pleasure to a woman, he marries her. If a man doesn't give pleasure to a woman, he is arrested. The title of the game is a reference to a Japanese legislation concerning underage rape.Though 177 was not the first game of this nature, the Komeito Party referred to the game on October 21, 1986. It was considered excessively explicit by the Japanese government, and was recalled and re-released with more conservative scenes and gameplay.[CR]External links[CR]Retro Japanese Computers: Gaming's Final Frontier at Hardcore Gaming 101[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>The 4th Unit 2</title_clean>
				<plot>The 4th Unit 2 is a direct sequel to The 4th Unit. The young and pretty bionic soldier Blon-Win has exposed the dark schemes of the trade organization WWWF. However, a new conspiracy is rising. WWWF has employed another bionic soldier, a young woman named Dalzy, who manages to seal Blon-Win's psychic powers. Blon-Win is arrested by WWWF and must find a way to contact her friends, escape, and defeat the treacherous organization.The sequel follows the same gameplay format, being a predominantly puzzle-less Japanese-style adventure with an interface that combines menu-based verb selection and interaction with objects and characters highlighted on-screen. Compared to the previous games, the gameplay is more streamlined and the menu contains less commands. Rarely used options such as answering "Yes" or "No" during dialogues or the command "Rescue" have been eliminated.</plot>

				<title_clean>Dual Targets - The 4th Unit Act. 3</title_clean>
				<plot>Three months have passed since the destruction of the oceanic base of the criminal organization WWWF. One day, Blon-Win and Asshu spot an android assassin attempting to infiltrate the Unified Force base. It appears that the androids, controlled by the WWWF, intend to kidnap the scientist responsible for the revolutionary device known as PPB (Psycho Power Booster). In addition, they have developed a bionic soldier who is a clone of Blon-Win. As if this weren't enough, Blon-Win's old nemesis Dalzy appears on the stage as well...Dual Targets is the third entry in the 4th Unit series and a direct sequel to The 4th Unit 2. The game retains the simple sporadic turn-based battles of the predecessors. However, the core adventure gameplay has been radically simplified and modified to resemble a visual novel. There is no direct interaction with the environment; instead, the player is prompted to select emotional responses ("happy", "angry", etc.) during dialogue, as well as alternate between "Rescue", "Think", and "Fight" commands during the storyline. These choices may influence the plot and lead the game to different endings, most of which are considered "false".</plot>

				<title_clean>Zero - The 4th Unit Act 4</title_clean>
				<plot>Zer&#248; is the fourth entry in the 4th Unit series and a direct sequel to Dual Targets. Only a few days have passed since the andoird assaults and the shocking encounter with Blon-Win's clone. The Unified Force gathers all its resources, preparing to engage the shady trade organization WWWF. However, a strange accident leads Blon-Win to assume that one of the Unified Force's members might be a traitor.Gameplay-wise, Zer&#248; returns to the Japanese adventure format of the first two entries, abandoning the visual novel style of its immediate predecessor. However, it still retains the emotional response system (only three out of five are present: "nice", "angry", and "sad"), which is sometimes needed to steer conversation. Topics are fixed for all dialogues. Much of the game involves looking for people located in various areas of the Unified Force base, trying to figure out who the spy is. The simple turn-based combat is present in this installment as well. The player can choose to attack any person Blon-Win encounters; however, attacking an ally would result in a Game Over regardless of the battle's outcome.</plot>

				<title_clean>D-Again - The 4th Unit 5</title_clean>
				<plot>The criminal trade organization WWWF was finally defeated. The bionic soldier Blon-Win is appointed a high-ranked inspector and sent on a mission to protect the secret service agent Remi Binderk on the way to the United Nations conference in Geneva. On board the TGV train in France Blon-Win encounters her old acquaintance Dalzy, who tells her that former WWWF members have united to form the Einheit group, and are working on a new dangerous weapon known as G-R.D-Again is the fifth entry in The 4th Unit series and a sequel to Zer&#248;. Gameplay-wise, it retains most elements introduced in the previous games. There are more context-specific commands and relative freedom of movement compared to the immediate predecessor. New commands include actions such as drinking and eating. Four emotional stances (nice, angry, sad, and surprised) are present. However, it is no longer possible to choose topics during dialogues. Like in the preceding game, Blon-Win can choose to attack any character at any time, and the simple turn-based combat mechanics of the series have been preserved.</plot>

				<plot>After Burner is an aircraft shooter. The goal is simple: use your F-14 Tomcat and shoot as many enemies as you can. This aircraft has two weapons: lock-on missiles and Vulcan cannons (basically machine guns). In some versions there is an option to let the cannons shoot automatically all the time.The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters. But at heart it offers the usual shooter mechanics, meaning you spend most of your time dodging and shooting. Sometimes you come across a friendly supply plane and if you dock with it you can replenish your missiles.</plot>

				<plot>In this arcade shoot'em up your mission is to infiltrate the alien fortress during 6 levels, and to destroy the fortress and the alien.Sitting in Ajax H.Q., you must pilot the remote controlled drone ship to do this. The drone represents jet fighter (behind view) and helicopter gunship (top-down view). It may be moved on the screen, fire air-to-air and air-to-ground guns and pow bomb. Limitless hordes of mechanoid invaders, whose sole intent is the total domination of the Earth, will try to stop you. Exit from each level is guarded by the powerful boss, who you should eliminate.DOS version of the game differs from C64/CPC/ZX version by the number and location of enemies, map of areas, order of the stages, and ability to use different controls to shoot air and ground targets.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Simon Belmont, the game's main protagonist (sporting his 2001 redesign).Castlevania Chronicles (known in Japan as Castlevania Chronicle: Devil's Castle Dracula) is an action horror platformer developed by KCE Tokyo and published by Konami for the Sony PlayStation on October 8, 2001.Originally a Japan-only 1993 game for the Sharp X68000 (titled Devil's Castle Dracula), Castlevania Chronicles is an enhanced remake of the original Castlevania, improving the graphics, music, and game engine while being more accurate to the original game (as opposed to Super Castlevania IV, which completely revamped the levels and content).The plot and premise for Castlevania Chronicles remains the same as the original Castlevania (and its other recreations): players control heroic vampire hunter Simon Belmont, wielder of the Vampire Killer whip, as he sets out through a dark, unholy castle in the year 1691 to search and destroy the evil Count Dracula.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] It includes two modes:Original mode, which is a faithful emulation of the original game.Arrange mode, which updates the art in some places and uses new music.Extras:If you hold L1 and R1 while selecting either original or arrange mode and press start, you are given the option to choose which of three sound modules you would like to use. The FM synthesizer module is the lowest quality, while the Roland GS module offers the highest quality. In original mode, it defaults to the lowest quality module, so this can be used to improve the audio experience significantly.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Simon Belmont, the game's main protagonist (sporting his 2001 redesign).Castlevania Chronicles (known in Japan as Castlevania Chronicle: Devil's Castle Dracula) is an action horror platformer developed by KCE Tokyo and published by Konami for the Sony PlayStation on October 8, 2001.Originally a Japan-only 1993 game for the Sharp X68000 (titled Devil's Castle Dracula), Castlevania Chronicles is an enhanced remake of the original Castlevania, improving the graphics, music, and game engine while being more accurate to the original game (as opposed to Super Castlevania IV, which completely revamped the levels and content).The plot and premise for Castlevania Chronicles remains the same as the original Castlevania (and its other recreations): players control heroic vampire hunter Simon Belmont, wielder of the Vampire Killer whip, as he sets out through a dark, unholy castle in the year 1691 to search and destroy the evil Count Dracula.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] It includes two modes:Original mode, which is a faithful emulation of the original game.Arrange mode, which updates the art in some places and uses new music.Extras:If you hold L1 and R1 while selecting either original or arrange mode and press start, you are given the option to choose which of three sound modules you would like to use. The FM synthesizer module is the lowest quality, while the Roland GS module offers the highest quality. In original mode, it defaults to the lowest quality module, so this can be used to improve the audio experience significantly.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Wisperad is a small universe that consists of only a few star systems. Hundreds of years ago, light-speed travel was invented, allowing the inhabitants of different star systems to navigate spaceships and establish contact with each other. Three hundred years ago, a great leader named Dumna founded a centralized kingdom where the different races populating the universe could leave in peace. However, after his death political tensions have increased, eventually resulting in the dissolution of the kingdom and the partition of Wisperad into three spheres of influence: the Mars Confederation, the Kingdom of Willia, and the Empire of Zolius.A young man named Sion Asmarn lives in the town of Cosma on the planet Homu together with his father, a famous explorer. One day, a huge meteorite falls on the planet. Sion's father goes to investigate it together with the physicist Mamon Penrose. Sion and his girlfriend Shoko, Mamon's daughter, venture into the canyon where the meteorite has fallen, only to witness Mamon, apparently possessed by a mysterious force, killing Sion's father and escaping. Determined to get to the bottom of this terrible affair, the two embark on a journey that takes them to different corners of the universe.Alshark is a Japanese-style sci-fi role-playing game with several distinguishing features. The player controls a party of up to five characters, exploring a vast world consisting of several solar systems, each with its own planets and space stations, many of which can be accessed in any order. Navigation in space is done with the help of the space ship Atlia, which can be equipped with various weapons, engines and frames. From time to time the player will engage in random space combat against enemy ships, earning scrap that can be converted into money. These dogfights are automatic by default, but the player can choose to control the ship and fire its weapons manually, in an arcade shooter style.The bulk of the exploration, however, takes place on planet surfaces, which the party can explore on foot or in vehicles such as buggies, tanks or hovercrafts. Enemies appear randomly; combat is turn-based and is viewed from the same overhead perspective as the exploration. Only Sion is directly controlled by the player, while other characters follow AI routines, using normal attacks as well as offensive and healing techniques. Characters can equip head and body armor, futuristic melee weapons, as well as a variety of firearms. A "party talk" feature is available, with the characters being able to consult each other at any time. The game is also notable for allowing the characters to level up beyond the customary cap of 100.The Sega CD version has new anime-style cutscenes and audio music tracks. The PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD version has a re-worked interface with full-screen navigation, as well as additional cutscenes and voice-overs. It also greatly reduces the amount of random enemy encounters during on-foot exploration, and generally lowers the difficulty level of the game.</plot>

				<plot>In the year 2069, the British ship "Elias Rits" sailed to Kermadec Island on a private investigation mission. Shortly thereafter, satellites reported that beacon transmissions from the ship have stopped. Seeing that further investigation required exploration of hostile environment and deep sea, the authorities dispatched a special team known as W-ODL to find out what has happened to the ship. Navigating a powerful mecha, the American pilot Fredric von Nyuya has to get to the bottom of the mystery and report his findings to the crew.[CR]Aquales is an action platformer. The mecha is equipped with a default fist-like melee weapon and gains access to other methods of destruction later, including chainguns, rockets, homing missiles, and more exotic items such as a gravity flamethrower. The stages usually consist of series of platforms and are fairly large, with optional areas and power-ups (health, one-time attacks, etc.) in treasure chests. The protagonist's stand-out equipment is the grappling hook, which must be used frequently to access high platforms. The game also has a light RPG angle: the hero gains experience points from defeating enemies and levels up as a result. Each stage ends with a boss battle, after which the player's progress is saved.</plot>

Multiple players can select between four heroes with different attack speeds and stats and must fight to stop the evil Dark Sorceress from destroying the world. It was developed by Wolf Team, who would become better known for the Tales series.Arcus Odyssey was released on the Sega Genesis and the Sharp X68000 Japanese home computer in 1991. Renovation Products ported the game to the Super Nintendo as Arcus Spirits in 1993. The Genesis version saw a US release, but the US version of the SNES game was canceled during production.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Arcus II - Silent Symphony</title_clean>
				<plot>Ten years have passed since the knight Jedah Chaf and his companions gained an audience with the Golden Dragon and made the choice that determined the destiny of the Arcusas land. The half-elf Picto was one of the five heroes who accompanied Jedah. A new adventure lies in front of him. Rumors of the legendary Rune Blade draw him out on a new quest, but his true mission will be to find his legendary companions and to rid Arcusas of a new terrible evil.Visually, Arcus II is more similar to a traditional Japanese RPG than its predecessor. The navigation is done in top-down perspective in all the locations. The turn-based battles are still viewed from first person perspective. The enemies are visible on screen and the battle initiates once the player into contact with one of them. Despite its typical RPG structure and gameplay focus (party management, turn-based battles, large world to explore, etc.), Arcus II lacks several basic RPG features. The party receives only gold and no experience points from battles. There are no weapons and/or armor that the characters are able to equip; money can only be spent on healing items. Enemies can be therefore avoided altogether, and the game's challenge lies in the boss battles.</plot>

				<plot>Two young warriors, Notos and Ing, were traveling in a faraway country, when suddenly a giant woman-snake appeared in front of them. Ing escaped, knowing that Notos was probably killed by the monsters. Tortured by his conscience, Ing is found by a local young girl named Luna. But soon Luna and other young village girls mysteriously disappear, and Ing decides to help them however he can - not forgetting his quest for revenge against the snake...Despite this RPG-like plot, the game is strictly a Japanese-style adventure. At every given screen, there are the standard Look, Talk, and Think commands. It is typically required to go through all the commands multiple times, obtaining the "Move" command and advancing the story.</plot>

				<title_clean>Ayumi-chan Monogatari</title_clean>
				<plot>The premise of Ayumi-chan Monogatari is rather simple: the protagonist, a young boy named Kouichi, is in love with the most beautiful girl in his school, Ayumi Kawai. One day she admits that she also loves him, and they begin a relationship.The game starts when the two are already together, and is dedicated entirely to their dates - which consist mostly of sex. The game can be therefore considered a basic dating/sex simulation. Kouichi and Ayumi meet everyday, and the player, controlling Kouichi, can sometimes decide where they go - though the interaction is quite limited. The player can also choose sex-related commands during the intimate part of their date, raising Ayumi's pleasure meter and unlocking new pictures.</plot>

				<title_clean>Baraduke</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Baraduke is a 2D side-scrolling shooter developed by Namco and first released in Arcades in Japan and Europe in 1985. It was later released for the PlayStation in 1997 in Namco Museum Vol. 5. It was released for the Xbox 360 in 2008 in Namco Museum: Virtual Arcade and finally in 2009 for the Virtual Console. The game follows Toby Masuyo (nicknamed Kissy), as she investigates the once-peaceful Planet Paccet, which has been taken over by aliens known as 'Octy'. In order to eliminate the alien force, she must travel deeper and deeper underground.It was an early side-scrolling, run &amp; gun shooter. It is also notable for its female protagonist, Toby Masuyo. She was the first truly empowered female video game protagonist who did not have a sexualized design. Her gender was not revealed until the surprise ending, where it reveals her name as "Kissy" with a portrait of her female appearance. This was a year before Metroid repeated the same idea with Samus Aran in 1986, though Kissy would never attain the same fame as Samus. Baraduke's gameplay system also bears a striking resemblane to Metroid.Toby Masuyo would later appear in the game Namco x Capcom with Hiromi Tengenji, the main character from Burning Force.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] in Baraduke Baraduke is a 2D shooter, where the player moves around in a low-gravity environment with the help of a jetpack. Each Stage is split up into 6 floors for a total of 48 floors in the game. In the first four floors in each stage, the player must clear the floor of 'Oktys', which will spawn squid-like creatures called 'Baranura' and 'Scyphula'. Buranuras will chase the player, and can only damage the player by contacting with them, however, Scyphulas are able to fire projectles at the player. Once the player has cleared the floor, the can exit the level through a chute located at the outside walls of the level. The player will also receive a 'Shield Bonus', depending on how much shield they had left at the completion of the level. In the second last floor, there are no Octys but rather a decent amount of capsules which grants the player higher chances in the next level. The final floor is the boss-stage. There are three bosses in the game, Blue Worm, which appears in Stage 1, 3, 5 and 7. It is screen-filling boss which shares a similarity to Kraid, firing projectiles from its four eyes, which must be destroyed in order to defeat it. The second is 'Turning Eye', appearing in Stage 2, 4 and 6. It moves around the stage firing projectiles at the player. The final boss, Octy King, appears at the end the of the game. The Roulette MinigameWhen defeating one of the Octy, they drop a capsule. When interacting with the capsule, they will aqquire one of three things: A yellow coin object which gives the player 100 points, a Paccet, which moves about and can be killed by enemies or they can meet the Bagan, which is a Pac-Man-like creature that will attack the player. They can also obtain a ray gun, a more powerful weapon for the duration of the level, but this is far less common. The appearance of each certain item is random. At the end of the level, there is a roulette style minigame with icons representing the amount of Paccet the player collected, an Octy or sometimes a blank 'N'. If the player lands on a Paccet, they gain an extra shield capacity. However, if they land on an Octy, they lose a shield capacity. If they land on an 'N', there is no change. This is quite an evil tactic on part of the game, since the player can sometimes complete a level without collecting a Paccet, then be faced with a full rotation of Octy's, thus having no choice but to lose a shield. The player can have up to eight shields. Naturally, if the player loses all their shield during the game they will lose a life. Also, If a player loses a life, they lose a shield but are able to continue the level from where they last died. On the default settings, the player will receieve a 1UP for gaining 10000 points, then another for every 20000 they gain.[CR]</plot>

Princess Tia Lohengrin manages to escape and meets Stil, the grandson of the warrior who first defeated Valusa. Stil must now fight his way through the monster-infested land and take the fight back to Valusa.Valusa no Fukush&#363; is a side-scrolling action game. Most of the game consists of traversing linear stages, fighting rapidly spawning regular enemies and bosses. Stil's default weapon is a sword; during the course of the game, he will acquire other weapons, such as throwing knives and shurikens. Enemies drop health-restoring items as well as temporary power-ups, e.g. a lightning attack that stays on the screen for a short while. When Stil's health bar is depleted, the player is taken back to the beginning of the stage with unlimited continues.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Battle Chess has been quoted as &#8220;a chess game for people who don&#8217;t like chess&#8221;. Each piece is brought to life by adding comical animations to them, moving across the board and violently attacking one another.Depending what piece attacks which, different attack comes into play. For example: if the player takes a knight with a knight he will cut his enemy limb from limb until all that is left is a bloody mess; however, if the player's knight gets close enough to take the queen he will cleverly dodge her incoming attacks and deflect her magic back upon her.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Bell's Avenue</title_clean>
				<plot>Bell's Avenue is a collection of three very short games, all of which play like minimalist Japanese-style adventures and have stories that revolve around sex. The interaction follows the standard verb-command "Look-Talk-Think" template, without any sub-menus that would allow interaction with different objects. The Lyrical Story After Rain, the shortest of the three, is an episode from the life of a lonely teenage girl, who meets another young girl on the train and later has erotic fantasies involving her.Paragon Wing Bird is considerably longer and has a sci-fi theme, the protagonist being a male adventurer from the Earth, who has encountered a race of human-like creatures in deep space and is interested in their sexual traditions.Kara is the longest of the three, is set in a high school, and describes a group of young girls who are eager to have their first sexual experience. This game allows menu-based navigation through various locations in the school and non-linear story progression, which can change depending on the player's choice and order of locations to visit.Bell's Avenue also contains Under Deep, a very short futuristic story, basically consisting of two bizarre sex scenes and having no interaction at all, and Minimum Hour, which presents, in a comical way, a few ideas for sex-based arcade games, which are not playable.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bomberman is a maze-based arcade game, developed by Hudson Soft. The first in the Bomberman series, it unfortunately didn't contain any multiplayer. At the time it was well-received and today it is considered as a genre-defining video game. There has since been countless iterations on its blueprint and huge multiplayer communities around them.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Bomberman is a robot working at a bomb factory who gets bored of making bombs. He hears a rumor that anyone that makes it out from the underground factory gets a wish. Bomberman, desperate to escape, sets out on a journey to the surface. The only thing standing in his way is the factory security guards who will do anything to stop him. Spoiler alert: Bomberman will turn into Runner when he reaches the surface.[CR]Other Versions[CR]The Famicom version differed slightly from the MSX original, so the Famicom version was ported back to the MSX under the title "Bomber Man Special".European versions were released under the names "Eric and the Floaters" (MSX/Spectrum) and Dyna Blaster (Amiga, Atari ST, and PC)[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Mobo and Robo Bonanza are enjoying their favorite television show when the picture crackles and a shadowy figure of a mysterious stranger appears on screen. This figure asks them to collect certain items that he has placed inside various buildings to test his security force. If they return the items successfully, Mobo and Robo will be rewarded. The two of them state that they will get the job done in just three minutes. However, little do they know that each building is packed with security guards who will raise the alarm if they are caught red-handed. Fortunately both Mobo and Robo are equipped with bullets that can knock the guards unconscious for a few seconds. An $100 reward will be given out if Mobo and Robo are apprehended.As either Mobo or Robo, you must collect all the treasures before leaving the ten buildings and shoot any security guards that get in your way. Remember that you are under a time limit. An in-game map will help you locate the treasures. There is a bonus stage after three buildings, where the object is to collect the gold bars in a limited amount of time without  one of the three spotlights shining on you. If it is possible, hide behind open doors. If you manage to get all the gold bars, 10,000 points is added to your score. There are three of these bonus stages, but each of them varies.</plot>

				<plot>Bonn&#333;-Yobik&#333; 3 is a quiz game. Unlike the previous game, it has a story with a protagonist: Miyake Kenichirou, a young man who is interested in two things: knowledge and pretty girls (aren't we all?..). He has heard of the famed Desires of Flesh Preparatory School (translation of the game's title), which is inhabited by gorgeous women. But in order to win their trust, the hero must prove his knowledge - mainly in anime and contemporary Japanese pop culture.The game has top-down view for school locations, and first-person view for the quiz parts. The navigation is extremely limited: basically, the hero is taken to the next room automatically and is unable to leave it until he competes against the girl that is standing there. The quiz sections come in different flavors: give enough correct answers in order to raise a bar and win the quiz; answer a series of timed questions; answer several questions correctly (a single wrong answer leading to Game Over), etc. Successfully completing a quiz rewards the player with an erotic picture.</plot>

				<plot>Bonn&#333;-Yobik&#333; 2 is a simulation of a game show (quiz). The player is given a time limit for each stage, which consists of 15 questions. The player must choose the correct answer among 4 available ones. It is possible to choose to compete in any of the 4 different categories: science, general knowledge (which include questions from different topics, such as geography, knowledge of Japanese language, etc.), anime (which also include video game-related questions), and finally, "men and women", which is just that: questions about sexual behavior, sex-related anatomy, sexual practices, etc.The presence of that last category essentially make Bonn&#333;-Yobik&#333; 2 an adult game; added to the flavor are erotic picture of various young girls, which are unlocked upon successfully completing a quiz stage.</plot>

He has heard of the famed Desires of Flesh Preparatory School (translation of the game's title), which is inhabited by gorgeous women. But in order to win their trust, the hero must prove his knowledge - mainly in anime and contemporary Japanese pop culture.The game has top-down view for school locations, and first-person view for the quiz parts. The navigation is extremely limited: basically, the hero is taken to the next room automatically and is unable to leave it until he competes against the girl that is standing there. The quiz sections come in different flavors: give enough correct answers in order to raise a bar and win the quiz; answer a series of timed questions; answer several questions correctly (a single wrong answer leading to Game Over), etc. Successfully completing a quiz rewards the player with an erotic picture.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] [CR] Bosconian is an arcade multi-directional space shooter developed and released by                                    Namco into           arcades in 1981. The player pilots a             spaceship that is fixed in the center of the screen, moving across a scrolling starfield in one of eight directions. The objective for the player is to destroy enemy          space stations positioned somewhere in the level (with guns that fire both forwards and backwards at the same time) while avoiding         asteroids, stationary mines, swarms of enemy spaceships, and enemy        missiles. The game was also ported to several home computer systems, including the                                   Commodore 64,                                  Sinclair ZX Spectrum,                                 MSX,                                Sharp X68000,                               Sharp X1, and                              NEC PC-6001. Most of these ports were published by                             Midway. The original arcade release was also released in certain                            Namco Museum compilations, namely                           Namco Museum Vol. 1 for the              PlayStation,                        Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary for the           PlayStation 2,          Xbox, and         GameCube,                    Namco Museum: Battle Collection for the       PSP,                 Namco Museum: Virtual Arcade for the    Xbox 360, and               Namco Museum Megamix for the  Wii.  Although Bosconian was not as popular as other multi-directional space shooters (such as       Sinistar), Bosconian was the first arcade game to include a standard      continue system, which allowed players to continue right where they left off once they are out of lives (by putting more credits into the machine). This option could be disabled by arcade operators via a DIP switch setting. Bosconian was also one of the first arcade games to use a digitized voice, which serves to cue players that either their spaceship was taking off, enemy spaceships are attacking, enemy spy ships are sighted, enemy spaceship formations are spotted, or when enemy spaceships are going berserk (when the condition indicator goes red).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR] The player's ship fires from the front and back simultaneously and is always fixed in the center of the screen. One hit from either an enemy bullet or a collision will kill the player. Bonus lives are awarded at set score milestones (such as at 10000 points). Movement was restricted to eight directions and the player had no control over the ship's speed. It was constantly in motion.The enemy will occasionally launch formation attacks with a lead ship. By destroying the lead ship, the formation will break apart. Destroying all of the ships in a formation awards bonus points.The game isn't timed, but it will become more aggressive if the player takes too long on a level. This is measured by the condition alert also displayed on the right side of the screen.  Flying off the "edge" of the map would only wrap the player around to the other side. Levels were cleared when all enemy bases were destroyed.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The game would receive a sequel called  Bosconian '87, but it would also be ported to several systems over the years as well as earn a place in Namco's                                              Namco Museum collection releases (Namco was a licensor of the game).[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The island of Radja was a peaceful place, ruled by a benevolent king. But one day, monsters have invaded the island. Both the prince and the princess of the kingdom were abducted. The king summons Shami, who, despite being a cute young girl, is the most powerful warrior of the kingdom. Shami has first to rescue the king's children, and eventually to find out the source of the demonic invasion.Gameplay-wise, Branmarker mainly follows early  Dragon Quest template: it is a top-down RPG with random turn-based battles viewed from first-person perspective. The player controls Shami and another character who joins the party. Shami can cast a variety of offensive and healing spells, the majority of which must be found in treasure chests located in the dungeons rather than bought or learned. The main gameplay takes part in hostile areas, which are reasonably complex and maze-like, taking a while to explore. Leveling up is automatic, and combat mechanics are basic Japanese RPG fare. What makes it different are the various anime-style cutscenes scattered through the game, most of which feature nudity and erotic content. </plot>

				<plot>Bretonne Lays is a role-playing game loosely based on the Breton lays, medieval European (mostly French or English) romance tales drawing inspiration from chivalric stories and Celtic mythology and folklore. Rather than presenting a single story the game is divided into several unrelated scenarios, each involving Celtic legends and mostly focusing on supernatural motives (floating islands, unicorns, popular Celtic figures such as Queen Mab, etc.). The player can choose between several male and female characters with pre-defined anime-style portraits, allocating points into their primary parameters. Much of the game is played solo, though a few NPCs can join the main character one at a time. Despite its Japanese origins the game takes cues from Western RPG design philosophy, offering non-linear exploration of vast interconnected areas. Battles take place on the same screen as exploration and involve turn-based navigation and simple attack commands.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bubble Bobble is an arcade game created by Taito. The arcade version of the game was released in 1986, with console and computer releases coming soon after. The game is a co-op platformer starring twin dinosaurs named Bub and Bob as they travel through one hundred one-screen levels. Bubble Bobble became very popular, inspiring a number of sequels and spin-offs.It was one of the first games to feature two-player cooperative play and multiple endings.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]An early levelBubble Bobble follows Bub and Bob as they venture through 100 different levels. The dinosaurs have the ability to blow bubbles, which they capture enemies within. Once an enemy is captured inside of a bubble, Bub and Bob must pop the bubble to defeat the enemy. Once defeated, the enemy will fly off and turn into a tasty treat, which can be snagged by Bub and Bob for points. The object of each level is to eliminate every foe. When one foe remains, they will become enraged and move faster. If Bub and Bob take too long, ghost whales will come and destroy the dinosaurs. Each level consists of one screen with a complex series of blocks. Bub and Bob can jump through thin layers of blocks, as can their enemies. There are two holes on the top of the screen and two holes on the bottom. All characters can travel through these to the opposite side of the screen.There is a large number of enemies, all of which have different traits. The most basic of these enemies is a small, square robot that runs around. Others include witches that create boulders,A level shaped like a characterwhales that bounce around, helicopter blobs, and more. As the game progresses, more enemy types appear in all sorts of locations, and the challenge comes in figuring out how to take out each type of enemy. Some offensive items that will commonly appear are waterfalls and lightning bolts. Waterfalls will sweep up any characters they pass and dump them down the hole. Lightning bubbles will fly horizontally across the screen, shocking anything they touch. There are also powerups that create short bonus rounds, such as one that spreads large cookies over the screen, and the players must gather them before the time runs out.[CR]Powerups[CR]There are a large variety of powerups to collect in the game, and some must be used to safely complete a level. Each one arrives randomly, and many are quite rare.Yellow Sweetie: Bubble firing speed increasesPurple Sweetie: Long range bubblesBlue Sweetie: Increase bubble firing speed across screenRed Ring: Points increase per bubble firedPurple Ring: Added points every jump performedBlue Ring: Added points for every pixel travelled.Red Shoe: Faster movementClock: Timer freezesOrange Umbrella: Skip 3 levelsRed Umbrella: Skip 5 levelsPurple Umbrella: Skip 7 levelsBlue Cross: Flood screen with water killing all enemiesRed Cross: Shoot fireballs instead of bubblesYellow Cross: Lightning flash kills all enemiesBlue Lamp: Gives effect of all three ringsYellow Lamp: Gives effect of all three SweetiesRed Lamp: Gives effect off both Blue and Yellow LampsPurple Lamp: Kills all enemiesBomb: Kills all enemiesBook: Kills all enemiesDiamond Pendant: Stars flood the screen killing all enemiesLightning Potion: Fires Lightning bolts instead of bubblesRed Bracelet: Causes E.X.T.E.N.D Bubbles to appear at next available opportunityWhite Bracket: A Ball bounces around the stage killing all enemiesFlashing Heart: Enemies freeze, dinosaur becomes invincibleCrystal Ball: Causes Item spawn frequency to increaseDungeon Door With Flames: Secret room with hidden messageWooden Dungeon Door: Only Appears on Lv 50.

In Japan, the Gamest Awards gave it the Silver Award for being one of the four best games of 1986, along with Taito's own Arkanoid, Sega's Fantasy Zone and Tecmo's Rygar (Gamest, The Best Game 2: Gamest Mook Vol. 112, pages 6-26). In Europe, Bubble Bobble was the most popular arcade game on Euromax's nationwide UK charts during the period of May-July 1987, above Capcom's 1942 at second place.The arcade game also received positive reviews from European critics. In the November 1986 issue of Computer and Video Games, Clare Edgeley described it as an "addictive" game that "sounds quite easy", letting "you in gently", before "the nasties get faster, more of them appear and they're harder to catch." She stated the "continue play facility" is "a great help and allows you to see much more of the game" if "you've got the cash", and the "two player option is more fun as" both "can act as a team" to "clear the screens quickly" and "get to the harder levels." She also noted "the sense of competition is heightened as the player who grabs the fruit gets the points, regardless of who burst the bubbles", which "fast develops into a race against each other." In the April 1987 issue of Crash, Gary Penn described it as a "deceptively simple" arcade game "that proves very addictive and lots of fun to play." He concluded that it was "very compelling" and recommended readers to "Invest a few coins as soon as you can."Home VersionsThe home console and computer ports were also well received. Mean Machines gave the Game Boy port of the game a score of 91%, noting that while some changes had been made, the game played identical to the original arcade port and "provides much addiction and challenge". The Spectrum version was voted number 58 in the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time. GamesRadar ranked it the 24th best NES game ever made. The staff praised its advancements over other platform games of its time and its use of multiple endings. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>The hero of this game is an ordinary high school student (the player has to name him by himself). He is mostly interested in pretty girls, in particular the lovely Mika, with whom he is even ready to discuss books just to get her attention. One day, a beautiful woman appears in front of him out of nowhere. She says that she is Venus, the goddess of love. She comes from a world called Cal, the eternal world populated by lovely girls. She tells the hero that soon he will be needed in that world... and disappears. Was that a dream? Or will our hero really travel to the magical world of Cal and encounter dangers he hasn't even imagined before?Cal is a visual novel, with the sole interaction consisting of choosing sentences to say and sometimes actions to do from a context-specific menu at the bottom of the screen. Usually only one such selection triggers the next event; some choices lead to Game Over. The game contains erotic pictures with nudity and sexual situations.</plot>

				<plot>The story of this game is simple. The protagonist is a lonely guy who constantly dreams about having a girlfriend but doesn't do anything to actually get one. One night, a fairy with bunny ears named Ariko appears in front of him and says she will fulfill one wish for him. Afterwards she simply guesses what the guy needs most badly: a girlfriend. So she gives him a magic book, which will give him information about five beautiful girls living somewhere in the city. With this book the hero's chances are increased. The quest for love begins!The game plays like a standard Japanese adventure (still shots of locations, menu-based interface), with some additions. The hero can buy items and give them to girls as presents to impress them. The conversations with the girls involve going through several topics to find out what the girl likes. Once a girl seems to be "ready", it's possible to directly use commands such as "kiss the girl", "touch the girl" (with body parts specified), and even "***** the girl", which speaks for itself.</plot>

				<title_clean>Can Can Bunny Superior</title_clean>
				<plot>The second game in the  Can Can Bunny series follows the story of a young Japanese boy named Takeshi. One fine night he looks out of the window and notices a sexy girl undressing in the opposite building. "Oh, if only I could get her", sighs Takeshi. Immediately, the kind bunny-eared fairy Ariko from the Magic Land appears and... grants Takeshi's wish! He now possesses a Magic Book that will teach him ho to conquer the hearts of pretty girls... and not just the hearts!Compared to the first game, Can Can Bunny Superior plays more like a stereotypical Japanese adventure, without the complications of buying items and alike, and with simpler menu commands like "Look", "Move", etc. In the beginning of the game, the player can choose between different initial statistics for Takeshi, which will influence the difficulty of conquering a particular girl. The game itself is divided into three separate scenarios, with up to four different girls in each (the scenarios begin in a shopping mall, aboard a plane, and in an amusement park), but the goal is always the same: talk to the girl in such a way that she will become yours.</plot>

				<title_clean>Can Can Bunny Premiere</title_clean>
				<plot>In this game, the player assumes the role of an ordinary Japanese young man who works in a restaurant. One day he comes home and finds seven strange creatures sitting at his table and discussing something you have no clue about. But before you decide to throw the uninvited guests out of your apartment, a beautiful green-haired woman appears. This is the goddess Swatty, and she has power over the Seven Lucky Gods, which the mysterious seven creatures turn out to be. Swatty feels pity for the lonely hero, and decides to help him to find a girlfriend.Can Can Bunny Premier is the fourth installment in the  Can Can Bunny series. Compared to its predecessors, it is the most pure Japanese-style adventure, without the strategy parts of the  previous game. The player chooses menu commands ("Look", "Talk", etc., as well as context-sensitive commands and dialogue choices) in order to advance the game. At several points it is possible to branch the story line, which mostly influences the amount of success the hero has had with a girl.</plot>

				<title_clean>Can Can Bunny Extra</title_clean>
				<plot>The fifth  Can Can Bunny game is also the first direct sequel within the series. The story is very similar to the one of the  previous game: once again, the hero is lonely and is anxious to get a girlfriend, or, to be more precise, to have sex with different girls. And once again, the benevolent and gorgeous goddess Swatty is here to provide assistance, together with her side-kicks, the Seven Lucky Gods from the Japanese mythology.Even though the story is pretty much the same as in the previous game,  the gameplay underwent significant enhancements. The interface is still traditional Japanese-style menu commands, but there are many more locations now, many of which can be freely accessed by clicking on them while on the main map. Once the player has reached the point where he can begin the physical seduction of the girl, the interface switches to point-and-click, with context-sensitive cursor for touching, kissing, etc. It is necessary to try different actions more than once to understand what the girl considers pleasant and what not, otherwise the girl might get angry and the game will be over. There are many more girls to seduce here than in the previous game, ranging from a school girl to a Catholic nun (seriously). There are also various extras (as the title implies), including an extensive album that arranges various pictures of the girls so that they tell her story, and an additional collection of stories, in which the hero can learn more about the girls he had met in the main game, and even interact with them again.</plot>

				<plot>In 2051, in the city of Neo Tokyo, there was a popular rock band called Caroll. One day, the lead singer of the group, Leyla, was kidnapped by an organization called Metal Cats. The police of Neo Tokyo tried in vain to rescue the singer: the kidnappers, utilizing a mysterious energy called ESP, were beyond their reach. The desperate police finally asked a young man named Akira to save Leyla - using his own ESP powers.Caroll uses a side-scrolling perspective for navigation, but it is not an action game, not even an action RPG; the core gameplay is that of a Japanese turn-based RPG. Enemies appear randomly, their portraits superimposed on whatever location Akira is currently in (effectively changing the perspective to first-person); a menu with battle commands pops up. Akira gathers money from battles (which can be spent in shops or hotels), as well as experience points needed to level up. Akira can execute various ESP techniques (such as healing); each time a technique is cast, an amount of his ESP points is depleted.</plot>

				<title_clean>Casablanca ni Ai o - Satsujin-sha wa Jikuu o Koete</title_clean>
				<plot>The year is 1945. Jerry Randolph, a female reporter working for the Chicago newspaper "Daily Casablanca", finds a diary belonging to her high school friend May Elgar, who has disappeared several years ago under mysterious circumstances. Jerry discovers that May's father was working on a groundbreaking scientific project. Too late to save Dr. Elgar from untimely death, Jerry uses a time machine constructed by him to travel to 1916, following the traces left by the criminals.In spite of its title, the game has little to do with the famous movie Casablanca beyond a few loose references. It is a text adventure with graphics, in which the player types text commands to interact with the environment. Several useful commands (including Look, Search, Take and Knock) can be accessed directly through function keys. Limited navigation between screens can be performed with directional arrows. English text input is supported to a certain degree, though text descriptions are in Japanese only.</plot>

				<plot>Cat's Part 1 casts the player in the role of an unnamed protagonist, presumably young, male, and very interested in the members of the opposite sex. One fine day he meets Stella, the queen of magic world. She tells him that her duty is to sustain the balance between worlds, but now her power is fading, which means a new queen has to arrive and take her place. To find this queen, Stella tells her companion Pixie to open the gates to seven different worlds: three modern-day ones, three futuristic ones, and one "past", and sends the hero on the quest for balance in the world... and numerous sexually fulfilling encounters with pretty girls from different dimensions.The game plays like a traditional Japanese adventure, with still pictures, plenty of text, and the necessity to go through all the commands several times to trigger new ones and eventually advance the story. However, unlike most games of this kind, Cat's Part 1 features a point-and-click interface along with the usual menu-based choices. Thus, the player can interact with various body parts of the girls, as well as some objects, by simply clicking on them.The player must complete Modern World 1 first, but after that is free to travel to the six remaining worlds in any order. It is also possible to teleport out of the world at any time using a magic stone.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The game was originally brought to the arcades in 1988 by  Taito, on the Taito Z System arcade board. Playing as a member of the Special Chase Investigation Department, players are tasked with chasing down the A.I controlled car before finally taking them down. The arcade version of the game included 5 levels for the player to play through.It was later ported onto home console and computer, including the critically acclaimed ZX Spectrum version, by Daiei Seisakusho and Ocean Software.It is a spiritual successor to Taito's Full Throttle. In turn, the game spawned two arcade based sequels called  Special Criminal Investigation in 1988 and Super Chase: Criminal Termination in 1992.The Turbografx-16 version of the game was released onto the Nintendo Wii Virtual Console in July 2008 costing 600 Wii points.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Viewed from a similar behind the car perspective as  OutRun there is an initial 60 second time limit for the player to reach the fleeing vehicle. This is often made more difficult by having more cars on the road and also by providing the player with a choice of two branching roads to take; with one being a slower route than the other to the enemy car. Once the enemy car is caught up with another 60 seconds is given to the player within which they have to bump into the car a certain amount of times forcing it pull over to the side of the road. The game has 5 different criminals, one for each level:1. Ralph, the Idaho Slasher2. Carlos, the New York armed robber3. Chicago pushers4. L.A kidnapper5. Eastern Bloc Spy[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The game's chase-themed driving gameplay, which involved ramming into enemy cars while avoiding the traffic, was a precursor to the chase/combat driving gameplay of later titles such as Road Rash, Mario Kart, Driver, Burnout, Grand Theft Auto, and Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cloud Master, or Chuuka Taisen as it's known in Japan, is a horizontal shoot 'em up featuring the literary character Sun Wukong, better known as the Monkey King and the deuteragonist of the Chinese novel Journey to the West. In the English localization of the game, the main character's name is changed to Mike Chen.Cloud Master was originally released in the Arcades by Taito in 1988. Of the home ports, the Master System version is the most well-known, due to it being the only version released in the West. The game also saw releases for the Famicom (which was developed by Disco) and the PC Engine (where it was known as Gokuraku! Chuuka Taisen).Cloud Master was granted a sequel 20 years later with The Monkey King: The Journey Begins.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Columns is a Tetris-style puzzle game in which the player moves and changes the order of a stack of three falling jewels, which must be combined and arranged to connect three of the same type of jewel. The three jewels can be successfully connected horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The game is over when the falling jewels have stacked all the way to the top of the screen. As time progresses, the speed at which the jewels fall increases, and the aim of the game is to last as long as possible to achieve the highest score. Columns also allowed players to compete against each other at the same time or against the computer in a Versus mode.This game came bundled with some Sega Genesis game systems.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Continental</title_clean>
				<plot>A brave young warrior (whom the player names in the beginning of the game) has had his share of epic battles, so he decides to relax in him own house in the imperial capital city, dedicating himself to his other interests (read: women). However, one day a pretty young lady (whom the player also has to name) storms into his house, saying she has a message from the Emperor himself. A princess is missing, so our two heroes have to find her. And the hero also has to face some of his old foes...Continental is a traditional Japanese RPG with a small party of heroes, top-down navigation, random turn-based battles viewed from first-person perspective, and no distinguishing characteristics but one: erotic scenes. There aren't as many here as in, for example,  Lightning Warrior Raidy games, and they mostly occur in city brothels or after boss battles. The enemies, however, do look like pretty (although demonic) girls. Instead of undressing, though (as they do in Raidy games), they just shrink in size upon defeat.</plot>

				<title_clean>Cosmic Psycho</title_clean>
				<plot>Kazuyuki is just an ordinary Japanese high-school student... or so he was before he saw a strange dream. In that dream, a girl was calling him from the outer space, imploring him to help her... The next day, Kazuyuki receives a strange phone call, after which he finds himself on board of a space ship! The girl from his dream appears and introduces herself: she is Marin, one of the members of a special squad that fights mysterious alien beings known as EX. Apparently, her message through time went to the wrong recipient, and now Kazuyuki is "stuck" in the end of the twenty-third century, reluctantly helping the beautiful ladies of the assault team to fight aliens - and perhaps engage in other, more pleasant activities.Cosmic Psycho plays predominantly like a typical Japanese adventure, with verb/object commands that must be chosen from a menu repeatedly to trigger the next scene. However, at certain points the game turns into a side-scrolling shooter. Clad in a flying robotic suit, Kazuyuki must blast his way through a (usually very short) stage filled with regular enemies and bosses.The game contains scenes with nudity and explicit sexual situations.</plot>

				<plot>Crescent is divided into four unrelated stories, which can be accessed directly from the main menu in any order. The first story is set in a fantasy scenario with a protagonist who tries to defeat a sexy female magician and her equally sexy female demonic minions; the second story involves a visit to a female detective, which evolves into an erotic encounter and unexpected violence; the third story is a visit to girls' locker room in a school; finally, the fourth story features an Asian-style mansion inhabited by pretty young women. All the four stories are heavy on explicit sexual content and are almost entirely dedicated to erotic scenes. The gameplay is confined to repeatedly selecting context-specific options (sometimes up to six) until the next event is triggered. Story progression is linear, but a few times wrong choices can lead to Game Over.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Cyber-Core is a Shoot 'Em Up developed by Alfa System and published by Information Global Service for the TurboGrafx-16 platform. After Earth comes under attack by an advanced insectoid alien species, an experimental bio-craft based on their technology is developed for a human pilot. This ship, the Chimera, is capable of changing shape whenever it finds new power-ups, modifying its HP and damage output.Cyber-Core was released on the PC Engine and the Sharp X68000 in 1990. It was localized for the US TurboGrafx-16 the same year, but changed the pilot's name from Kato Melange to "Rad Ralph".[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>D-Return</title_clean>
				<plot>In the middle of the 22th century World War III began between the Allied Power and the Pact Power. Atomic weaponry was long abandoned, and neither side could gain the upper hand. However, twenty years later the Pact Power has constructed a deadly battle satellite on the Moon, aptly named "Disastrous Disaster". Fearing that the war will be lost if the satellite attacks their bases on the Earth, the Allied sends an Illieus fighter craft, navigated by the young pilot Unebi Kagurazaka, to counter the threat.D-Return is a horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up. The player controls an aircraft, moving in four directions, avoiding enemy fire and destroying enemies with primary weapon (vulcan gun or laser) and missiles, of which there is a limited supply. The player-controlled plane has a health bar which can be restored by flying over specific power-ups. The player can choose between four difficulty levels, amount of hit points and missiles, as well as the speed of the game. Stages usually end in boss battle.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ghouls 'N Ghosts in an action-platforming game originally published in 1988 by Capcom for arcades. The game has since been ported to several home computers and consoles. It is the second entry in the notoriously-difficult Ghosts 'N Goblins franchise. Three years after Sir Arthur rescues his true love Princess Prin Prin from the evil Astaroth, Lucifer (or Loki in some versions) brings forth an army of macabre minions and steals the  souls of several helpless victims; among the souls stolen is that of Arthur's beloved. Once again, Arthur dons his trusty armor to fight the demonic hordes and rescue these lost souls.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Arthur unleashes Thunder MagicGhouls 'N Ghosts gameplay is nearly identical to that of its predecessor, but with a few notable exceptions. Arguably the most significant addition is Arthur's new ability to fire any weapon vertically up or down. Most of the original game's weapons are present and a few new weapons have been added, as well as a new set of magically-infused Golden Armor. When equipped, the Golden Armor allows Arthur to charge his current weapon to perform a powerful magic attack. Each weapon has its own unique magic, save for the Psycho Cannon.Weapons &amp; Magic Lance - Fires a lance in a straight line. Thunder Magic fires a powerful magic bolt vertically from the top of the screen towards Arthur's position, which then splits horizontally to the left and right. This weapon is called "Sword" in some versions. Sword - A strong melee-only weapon that is swung in a short arc. Thunder Dragon Magic unleashes a flaming dragon upward that attacks sky-bound enemies. This weapon is called "Super Sword" in some versions. Axe - Hurls an axe in a straight line. This weapon can penetrate objects, but has a slow rate of fire. Exploding Magic summons several large explosions around Arthur's position.Torch - Lobs a torch in a short arc; upon impact with the ground, a line of damaging flames extends across the surface. Fireball Magic creates four fireballs that swirl outward from Arthur's left and right sides. This weapon is called "Fire Water" in some versions.Discus - Fires a bladed disc in a straight line which will follow the contour of any platforms on contact. Firing while crouching causes the disc to move along the ground's surface. Mirror Magic creates a temporary protective shield ahead of Arthur's position.Dagger - Fires a dagger in a straight line. This weapon is comparatively weak, but it also has the fastest rate of fire in the game. Double Magic creates an invulnerable shadow clone of Arthur that mimics his movement and attacks for a short time.Psycho Cannon - Only available on the second playthrough. Fires a blast of powerful magic in a straight line for a short distance. This weapon cannot be charged, although its range is increased while wearing the Golden Armor.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Ghouls 'N Ghosts WorldThe game features five Stages, each of which is split into two distinct areas by a checkpoint.Stage OneThe Execution Place, a mass grave at the edge of the Demon Realm, is where Arthur begins his long quest; however, the murderous skeletons, swooping vultures and hair-trigger guillotines located here will attempt to bring his adventure to a very sudden end. This area is also a tribute to the first Stage of the original Ghosts 'N Goblins, complete with remixed music. The Stage's second half at the Floating Island on the Lake features strong winds that slow movement to a crawl. Past the island's poisonous forest, a giant demon known as Shielder protects the exit by spitting fireballs.Stage TwoA constant stream of demonic turtles bounce down the slope leading to the The Village of Decay, a destroyed human settlement. After crossing a gigantic ant lion pit, Arthur is ambushed by an upgraded version of Firebrand known as the Red Arremer King. Further ahead, earthquakes and demonic flames plague the Town of Fire, a sweltering ruin terrorized by the hell-hound Cerberus.Stage ThreeArthur finds himself riding a treacherous elevator up through Baron Rankle's Tower; quick movements are required to avoid being crushed against the ceiling in this auto-scrolling area. At the peak of the Horrible-Faced Mountain, Arthur boldly leaps across the outstretched tongues of several demonic statues before battling a living storm cloud called Gassuto.Stage FourGiant bones litter the floor of The Crystal Forest, a cave system leading directly into Lucifer's castle. At the halfway point, Arthur descends down the slippery slopes of The Rotting Grotto, stepping across several man-eating plants to land on the back of Ohme, a gigantic immobile worm infested with smaller creatures that collectively act as the Stage boss.Stage FiveIf pain was like food, then Lucifer's Castle of Evil Demons would be a feast. The entryway swarms with skeletal dragons and a gauntlet of four Red Arremer Kings as an appetizer. After climbing an ominous spiked ladder, Arthur does battle with Astaroth, the final boss of the original Ghosts 'N Goblins. Once Astaroth is dispatched, Arthur is assaulted by two Shielder heads attached to the walls of the next room. Twin Astaroths flank Arthur for a surprise rematch further ahead, followed by a trio of Gassutos. Past one final Shielder head and a legion of demonic insects, Beelzebub guards the Stage exit.After completing this Stage, Arthur receives a message that he cannot defeat Lucifer without the Psycho Cannon, a weapon blessed by the goddess of battle. In the series' tradition, Arthur is sent back to the first Stage, where players must complete the full game a second time. While wearing the Golden Armor, players can discover the Psycho Cannon in certain treasure chests on the second playthrough.Final Boss: LuciferThe enormous Lord of Hell sits atop his throne, firing lasers from his mouth and hands and stomping his feet in a last-ditch attempt to exterminate Arthur. However, his evil strength is no match for the power of the Psycho Cannon, which Arthur uses to destroy Lucifer once and for all before reuniting with Princess Prin Prin.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Daisenryaku II: Campaign Version is a turn-based war strategy game that relies on the gameplay template introduced in Daisenryaku II: up to four players engage in battles against each other or computer AI, represented by differently colored armies (blue, red, green, and yellow); the belligerents produce units and vehicles and navigate them on a hex-based grid, trying to occupy the enemy's major cities and harbors. The game includes a main campaign with introduction and background information about the fictional countries involved in the conflict. In addition, at least a dozen playable maps are included, some representing real geographical areas. The MSX and PC Engine (TurboGrafx) CD versions feature enhanced graphics, full-screen battle sequences with backgrounds, and many additional maps.</plot>

				<plot>A young man gets involved in a struggle between the gods Martis and Mira. Serving Martis, he believes that in order to restore the balance he has to unseal this deity, the protector of all women. Fourteen chosen girls must fight alongside the hero, venturing into the depth of a sacred mountain and helping him to defeat countless monsters who live there.Made by the creators of Rance series, Dalk is an erotic RPG. However, it is more heavy on strategy element than Rance games. Town navigation is done from first-person view. You choose your party members among the 14 available girls, and take them to fight in the mountain. Once you enter the dungeon, the game switches to top-down view, and you advance in turn-based mode, assigning commands to your party and waiting for the enemy party to move. You can attack when an enemy is in range, or cast spells with your magic users.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mutant Fighter is a fighter game from Data East that originally debuted in the Arcades. The game includes various characters influenced by Ancient Greek mythology and its combat is more wrestling-oriented, with grapples, suplexes and Irish whips.The game appeared in Arcades in 1991, with the name Mutant Fighter in the west and Death Brade in its native Japan. ('Brade' is thought to be a misspelling of 'Blade'.) The game was ported to the Sharp X68000, FM Towns and SNES. The former two are known for their faithful Arcade ports, and their versions are very similar to the original Arcade game. The SNES port had to be downgraded in several areas, including the number of playable characters.CharactersThe Arcade version has eight playable characters, as does the Sharp X68000 and FM Towns conversions, though the SNES port only has five:Fighter: A human warrior with spiky hair. An all-rounder.Amazoness: A female human warrior whose best strength is her speed.Hercules: A Spartan warrior of considerable strength. Slow and powerful, and devastating up close.Beast: A reptilian beast with powerful jumping attacks.Minotaur: A minotaur with strong charging attacks. Grows stronger as the battle continues.The Arcade version also has:Werewolf: A speedy werewolf with deadly claw attacks. Golem: A slow but extremely durable living statue. Regular attacks are barely effective.Dragon: A wingless dragon with a breath attack.In addition, the game has several unplayable "boss" characters:Hydra: A multi-headed hydra with very strong grapple attacks. Doppelganger: A shapeshifter creature that transforms into his opponent.Demon: A formidable demon known as Pazuzu in-game. A powerful all-round boss.Archmage: A magic-user who is deadlier at a distance.  [CR]</plot>

				<plot>A powerful wizard, yearning for even more power, has found a sacred book that granted him command over armies of demons and men. Possessed by the desire to conquer and to destroy, he orders his armies to set cities on fire, massacring the citizens. But one nameless hero, the protagonist of this game, has to stand up against the evil. Leaving Soron, his home village, the hero embarks on a journey to find companions and to face together the forces of darkness.Despite being a Japanese game, Death Bringer is more similar to Western RPGs of the time than to their Japanese counterparts, even though it has anime-style character graphics. It is less event-oriented than Japanese games and focuses on exploration. The gameplay is somewhat similar to  Pandora's  RPG of the same name, even though the two games are unrelated. Both friendly and hostile areas are pseudo-3D, maze-like environments, like in  Bard's Tale games. Enemy encounters, however, are handled more similarly to those of  Ultima: the enemies appear on the exploration screen, and the battle initiates only if the player character approaches the enemy. The battles take place on a top-down field; the heroes and the enemies move around, but the player can't navigate the characters manually: it is only possible to issue commands such as "Attack", "Use Magic", etc. The game has a day/night cycle. Party members (up to three, excluding the hero) have to be sought out in various cities, rather then joining the hero for plot-related reasons.</plot>

				<plot>There's plenty of reflection in this game, in both senses of the word. That's because this strategic puzzler involves using mirrors to direct a beam of light across a succession of 60 screens. Each mirror has 16 different angles it can be set at, each of which will send the beam around the screen in different ways.Before the exit is activated, all the mines on a screen must be cleared by running the beam over them. There are other devices built into the levels, including teleports and random angle-changers, as well as hazards to avoid (they cause the beam to overheat) and droids which go around moving the mirrors' directions.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Detana!! TwinBee translates to "It's Here!! TwinBee," but outside of Japan the game is known as "Bells &amp; Whistles." Both TwinBee and WinBee return as stars of this vertical-scrolling cute 'em up sequel to Konami's 1985 hit TwinBee. It also introduces Light and Pastel, although they were not named in this release.Detana!! TwinBee was originally released in Arcades in 1991 in multiple regions, and is actually the fifth game in the TwinBee series. It is, however, only the second TwinBee game after the original to be released in the Arcades first, as the previous TwinBee sequels (Stinger, TwinBee 3 and the Game Boy Pop'n TwinBee) were all console exclusives. Detana!! TwinBee eventually received Sharp X68000 and PC Engine releases, both of which were exclusive to Japan, unlike the original Arcade version. In 2009 the PC Engine version was made available to overseas territories for the first time via the Wii's Virtual Console. Detana!! TwinBee is also featured on the Detana TwinBee Yahho! Deluxe Pack, a compilation of Detana!! TwinBee and TwinBee Yahho, released exclusively in Japan for the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Legend says that there exists an ancient world known as Vereator, powered by the mysterious energy Verbias. The treasure hunter Connor Macguire and his assistant Rania venture into deep space in search of riches. Their ship is trapped in Vereator, and the two begin to explore the strange world, hoping to find the source of Verbias. On the way they will have to defeat robotic legions of a malevolent professor who pursues his own agenda.Die Bahnwelt is a top-down shooter. The player navigates Connor through maze-like environments, shooting at frequently respawning enemies in eight directions. A second character participates in battles on his side, controlled by computer AI; general tactics can be assigned to that character by the player through conversation. Each of the two characters can hold up to four weapons, using various types of energy ammo that can be found in treasure chests or dropped by enemies. Weapons can be switched at any time. There are no healing items, but both characters continuously regenerate their health. It is possible to save the game at any time.</plot>

				<title_clean>Dome</title_clean>
				<plot>DOME is based on Shizuko Natsuki's novel of the same name. The original work as well as the game's plot focus on the construction of a nuclear shelter called "The Dome", capable of protecting humans from an impending atomic war. The player takes the role of an employee in an advertisement company, whose job is to raise people's awareness of the shelter's importance, and donate money to the project.The game opens System Sacom's Novel Ware series, demonstrating its concept. Though its basic gameplay is that of a puzzle-less Japanese-style adventure, the game has extended dialogue and text descriptions that either do not contain any interaction or occasionally prompt the player to make a choice. Despite this visual novel-like feature, the game still retains considerable portions of interactivity, with verb-object commands, reviewing information concerning recent events and characters in the game, and even the possibility to take and examine objects. The game's graphics consist of digitized photos of people and objects, and are rather sparse.</plot>

				<plot>DOR features three independent scenarios, which are not connected to each other story-wise and can be accessed directly from the main menu.The first scenario depicts a meeting between the male protagonist and a mysterious young woman near a giant observatory telescope. The hero finds out about the woman's tragic past and proceeds to "console" her.The second scenario describes a telephone date a boy named Takeshi arranges with two "OLs" ("office ladies"). The hero must manipulate the conversation in such a way that he will win the graces of both.The second scenario involves a cute female vampire named Kanako visiting the (again, male) hero in his apartment. Kanako is hungry and needs blood, so the protagonist has to come up with the right idea of what to demand in exchange for it.All the three scenarios share the same gameplay: at every screen, the player is presented with a short list of possible answers/actions (usually 3). Some situations require to go through the choices several times in order to advance the story, while others contain "bad" choices that lead to Game Over.</plot>

Luckily, on that particular day the company decides to interview a few young and pretty women, and naturally, the hero is glad to jump at that opportunity...The second scenario depicts an average guy on a plane who pretends to be a real hijacker, threatening the passengers and coercing the female flight attendants to perform services of sexual nature for him.The third scenario tells the story of a mad scientist, who has invented a machine that would turn human being into his willing slaves. At first, the scientist decides to use this machine on his cute female assistant, but in an unexpected turn of events, new victims appear...The gameplay in all the scenarios of DOR Part 3 is exactly the same as in the other DOR games: at each screen, the player is given several (usually three or four) choices of actions or responses. Choosing the correct ones (or, as it often happens, going through all the choices several times) triggers the next event, while choosing wrong actions might lead to a Game Over.</plot>

				<title_clean>Dor Special Edition '93</title_clean>
				<plot>DOR Special Edition '93 is neither a compilation, re-release, nor a remake; it is an independent entry in the  DOR series. Typically for the series, the game consists of three completely unrelated scenarios. They can be accessed from the initial game "hub", which is viewed from a top-down perspective and allows the player to control the sexy demon Akuma, the series' mascot, as she runs around a small town, visiting houses that lead to the game's features: playing the scenarios, viewing the pictures, getting acquainted with the developers, etc.The first scenario tells the story of a Japanese businessman and treasure hunter named Hiroshi, who has organized a perilous expedition into South American jungle, hoping to find the legendary spring of eternal youth. However, on the way to their discovery, the group has to confront monsters and other dangerous specimens of the jungle...The second scenario is set in a pseudo Middle-Eastern environment, and focuses on a man named Farouk, who was cursed by an evil magician. In order to remove the curse, Farouk travels through a vast desert to a nearby town, hoping to find people who would help him in his predicament.The third scenario directly continues one of the scenarios of  DOR 2. It is sub-titled Armored Fighter Gyleban, and is the second part of the story. The protagonist is the leader of a squad of female fighters, who confront an organization under the leadership of the evil Grauber. Grauber's warrior, a young girl named Meiya, switches sides and decides to help the heroes in their battle.The gameplay is mostly similar to other DOR games - picking choices from a menu until the next scene is triggered. However, during certain scenes the interface switches to point-and-click, with selectable icons ("tongue" and "hand"), which pretty much explains the direction those "certain scenes" lead into.</plot>

				<title_clean>Dor Special Edition Sakigake</title_clean>
				<plot>DOR Special Edition: Sakigake is the fourth entry in the  DOR series. Unlike all the previous games, it contains only one scenario instead of the usual three.The scenario follows the story of Kensuke Funaki, a young boy who attends a prestigious private high school, where the students specialize in sports as well as various theatrical activities. The biggest event of the school is an all-female wrestling competition. Kensuke finds himself in a promising situation: in order to secure his support, the young and pretty competitors are willing to go far - very, very far...The gameplay in DOR Special Edition: Sakigake is  the same as in the previous entries. At every screen, the player reads a bulk of text (descriptions and dialogue), after which a menu with a few (usually three) selectable actions/responses pops out. It is often needed to go through the choices several times before the next event is triggered, and the player is taken to another screen.</plot>

				<title_clean>Double Eagle</title_clean>
				<plot>Double Eagle is a golf simulation game. The tagline "2way Golf Simulation" refers to the two game modes to choose from.GOLFLIFE is career simulation. The player's character starts out 20 years and 1 month old and with 100 yen, and has 30 in-game years to win tournaments, move up the Japan and World rankings and advance up the classes (Amateur class, Professional Class B, Professional Class A and Professional Class S) before retiring at age 50. There are four stats: physical, mental, technic (technique) and fatigue that affect your performance. To start out you need buy or rent a club at the golf shop. Extra money can be earned by doing one of the three side jobs. At first there is light work, hard labour and caddie, moving up the classes lesson, TV booking and commercial become available. Each job pays differently as well as affect your stats, most notably increases fatigue. To get rid of fatigue you can rest at home, hot springs or hospital. There's also three training options: gym increases the physical stat, image increase mental stat and course allows to practice on courses, thus gain technic. Each action advance the time by one month.The game features 40 tournaments, either two-day or three-day with all participants playing 18 holes each day. Some tournaments also require a qualifying round for the main competition. On the course you're joined by 2 or 3 AI players.PLAYGOLF allows 1-4 players (human and/or AI) to play an 18 hole round. There are 12 courses to select from as well as different seasons/conditions - spring, summer, autumn, winter and snow. When on the golf course the action is viewed from a top-down perspective, players can choose the club they want to use, direction of the shot, how the golf ball curves (fade/draw) as well as adjust the shot power and accuracy by stopping a moving bar at the right time. Wind direction and power must also be considered as you play your shot.</plot>

				<plot>In D&#333;ky&#363;sei, the player takes the role of a high-school student (default name Takurou) in a Japanese town; his parents have just moved into a large mansion in a good district. The boy has to go to the new school, but his mind is preoccupied with one subject only: pretty girls. Instead of studying hard, Takurou decides to explore the city and to find out more about its female inhabitants.D&#333;ky&#363;sei is more interactive than most other Japanese adventures, utilizing point-and-click interface (with context-sensitive icons for talking, touching, etc.) and featuring free top-down navigation through the town and the school building. The hero can enter restaurants, shops, cafe houses, etc. It is also possible to take a train to another district and explore it. The game has an internal clock; a visit to any location (including separate rooms of a building, etc.) "costs" twenty minutes of the game time. The purpose of the game is to learn where and when the fourteen "datable" girls usually are. Many of the conversations with the girls feature multiple answers; the success in many cases depends on the player's choices.The game has scenes with nudity and explicit sexual situations.</plot>

				<title_clean>Dracula Hakushaku</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR] Your old digs.     After 300 years, Count Dracula has risen from the grave. Returning to his home, he finds his seven vampire brides are no more, and the world he once terrorized gone. Setting out on a journey, while reminiscing about his lost loves, he finds himself shadowed by a stranger who claims to bear the name Van Helsing, but who in fact may be someone far more dangerous.   [CR]Setting  [CR]  A not so inviting castle...     Set in what appears to be a generic version of mid-19th century Europe, the in-game locations include:  A small town in the shadow of Dracula's Castle.A monastery.A tavern.A castle occupied by an anti-vampire cult.A brothel.Underground tunnels.A garden maze... Some locations are the settings of various memories the Count finds himself recalling. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] [CR]Find the correct sequence of words to proceed.     The game uses a traditional point and click interface, including icons for Look, Talk, Use, and Move. A little less common is the addition of a "Think" function - an icon of a human brain - which can be used to expand on dialogs and situations, opening up new options to the player. Two additional functions - Kiss, and Bite - can be used when the situation warrants.  [CR]Versions [CR]    Both versions are largely identical, though the      PC 9801 version contains a minor amount of extra content. [CR]Content[CR] I've had this dream before.Dracula Hakushaku features occasional nudity and sexual situations, and while explicitness varies, these scenes tend to be soft-core in nature.   [CR] Trivia[CR] The game is also known as "Count Dracula". Both versions are spread over four floppy discs.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Dragon Eyes</title_clean>
				<plot>Dragon Eyes is a "space opera" kind of story, focusing on a young girl named Ines, who lives on the planet Miu of the Phi Sun. She grew up together with a space agent named Klind, to whom she refers as "brother". One day, her superior from the planet Garudoria informs her that Klind has disappeared during one of his missions and might be in danger. Ines travels to Garudoria to find additional information, and soon becomes involved in a vast space conflict...Dragon Eyes plays like a traditional Japanese adventure, with commands such as Examine, Talk, Think, and Move appearing on every screen. Choosing one of those commands usually leads into a sub-menu of objects. There is also limited usage of items, which is sometimes required in order to advance in the game.There are a few scenes with graphical nudity, but no explicit sex scenes.</plot>

				<plot>Strawberry Fields was once a peaceful land. Ruled by the lovely queen Luna and populated only by women, the country knew no trouble. The Goddess Tower protected the inhabitants of Strawberry Fields. But recently, something happened in the tower. It is said that a dragon descended upon it, spawning an army of dragon knights who were threatening the peaceful land. The queen Luna summons you, a wandering adventurer, to descend into the depth of the Goddess Tower and to purge the evil from the land.Dragon Knight marked the beginning of Elf's erotic RPG series.

				<plot>It is the second part in the   Dragon Knight series.   Takeru Yamato, a young adventurer who  just seems to want a warm bed and a hot babe, wanders into the land of Strawberry Fields, which is ordinarily a  pleasant place with beautiful women abound, but it has been swept by an  evil curse: Mesaanya the sorceress has abducted all the local maidens to her tower and cast a spell causing them to do her bidding. Takeru  is asked to help the girls, to which he agrees mainly because he feels  they will be VERY grateful for being rescued.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Dragon Spirit</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dragon Spirit is a vertical shoot-em-up that owes many of its mechanics to Namco's earlier arcade hit Xevious. The most direct similarity is that the dragon has two forms of firepower: A fireball that hits aerial enemies and a bomb that hits ground-based enemies.The dragon can power up by collecting eggs: Red eggs will increase the power of the dragon's fire breath while the blue eggs allow him to grow an additional head, effectively doubling its damage output as well as increasing the coverage. It's possible to have up to three heads in total. In addition, there are also various weapon power-ups that provide a temporary boon such as larger flame spouts or enemy-seeking fireballs.Dragon Spirit saw many home conversions for both computers and consoles. The NES version, Dragon Spirit: The New Legend, made many modifications to the game.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Dragon Wars takes place in the magical land of Dilmun, an island of salvation perverted into a world of horror by Namtar (as you might expect - the bad guy).The player starts with a party of four in the city of Purgatory, equipped with nothing more than.. well - nothing. Worst of all your magic users won't help you out, either, because magic has been banned (to correct this unpleasing situation is one of your main objectives). Other main targets are surviving, getting out of Purgatory and toppling Namtar (maybe getting some decent clothing, one or two shiny swords and the like on your way out).Gameplay instantly reminds of the Bard's Tale series. Step-by-step first person 3D, opponents materialize out of the air. The combat system is turn based.Unlike its (spiritual?) predecessors the game features a full-blown skill system, auto-mapping and many places to actually use all these abilities.Reasonable distribution of your skill points is rather critical. </plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]DragonStrike is a dragon flight simulator taking place in the Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe developed primarily for home computers by Westwood Associates and published by Strategic Simulations in 1990. A highly modified port for the Nintendo Entertainment System was also developed by Westwood Associates and published by Pony Canyon in July, 1992.[CR]Home Computer[CR]Home computer 1st-person gameplayPrimarily released as a game for home computers, DragonStrike put players in control of a dragon from a first-person perspective, completing 20 set missions, going through a rank system and gaining magical abilities. The gameplay mostly comprises of simulation-like flight, intercepting enemy dragons and destroying enemy ships with your unique dragon abilities.[CR]Nintendo Entertainment System[CR]NES top-down gameplaySomewhat drastically different when it eventually came to the Nintendo Entertainment System two years later, DragonStrike shifted the whole perspective of the game to a top-down style shooter with a higher emphasis on action rather than simulation. Basic gameplay elements stayed consistent with the home computer release, with battles between dragons and enemy convoy a central focus.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Drakkhen</title_clean>
				<plot>The prophecy has been fulfilled. The world shall be ruled by the dragons. On an island far away, their lords prepare for the conquest of the lands. There is only one hope for mankind. The emperor sends out four heroes -- warriors and magicians -- to solve the puzzle of tears and prevent the invasion of the Drakkhen.Drakkhen is a role-playing game with a visual presentation that combines 3D landscapes and 2D interiors. The player's party will travel overland on a flat terrain made up of vectors, on which 2D objects are zoomed (The same type of engine was later used in Eternam). The player will encounter monsters and fight them in real-time combat, and discover the palaces of the dragon lords. Indoors, the player has to find a way through the maze of chambers, solving puzzles and defeating the minions of the Drakkhen. Party members are depicted in four status windows on the left side of the screen, thus allowing to see their current status and equipment at once.</plot>

				<title_clean>Dungeon Master</title_clean>
				<plot>Dungeon Master is a role-playing game where the player selects four adventurers and descend into the depths of the dungeon.  The gameplay is reminiscent of the 3D dungeon crawl type of role-playing games popularized by Wizardry and The Bard's Tale.  However, unlike these games, Dungeon Master features real-time combat, which requires the player to click on the opponent in order to execute an attack. Another notable aspect of the game is its growth system: instead of gathering experience points and leveling up, characters improve by repeatedly using the same action. Spellcasting involves selecting and combining symbols, which can be arranged as rune sequences. The game also allows the player to directly interact with objects in the game world through a point-and-click interface.</plot>

Battling your way to defeat a turncoat scientist creating an army of mutants, Dynamite Duke was a over-the-shoulder rail shooter. Armed with a MAC-10 and cybernetic arm, Duke shot and punched his way through the game's levels, as it offered both shooting and hand-to-hand action.An updated version of Dynamite Duke with simultaneous multiplayer was released to arcades under the name "The Double Dynamites."[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Eikan wa Kimi ni is a Japanese high school baseball management game. The player creates a manager, choosing his birthday, blood group, preferences, etc., which influence his standing with the team and players. During the management phase, it is necessary to assemble the team, choosing between various male high school students, each with his own statistics. The manager then makes schedules for the players, which include training sessions of varying difficulty. It is also possible to change the manager's mood, which leads to different results depending on the team's spirit and personality. The player can advance the time by one day, one week, or until the next event, e.g. a test in the school or a game against another team.</plot>

				<title_clean>Emerald Densetsu</title_clean>
				<plot>Somewhere in the galaxy, there is a planet named Sera. It is protected by a wall of energy which its inhabitants call "Force". The Force is sustained by magical crystals known as seeds. When demons begin to invade the planet, the task of the nameless hero is to gather the seeds, which are scattered all over Sera's surface, to restore the Force of the planet, and to save it from demonic invasion.The entire exploration in Emerald Densetsu is done from a side-scrolling perspective, but it is not an action game; it is a solo turn-based RPG. Enemies appear randomly, their pictures super-imposed on the exploration screen (thus turning the battles into first-person view). The fighting is performed by selecting menu commands. The hero has "force points" and uses various "force techniques", which work like magic spells (healing, offensive, etc.). Defeated enemies give the hero experience points, allowing him to level up and become stronger. There is no money in the game; items, weapons, and armor can only be found by exploring the world, or dropped by enemies.</plot>

				<plot>Fail Land is a magical realm of island floating high in the sky. One day, Princess Rilule finds out that an evil witch has sent her minions to imprison female magicians. As a result, monsters are roaming the countryside and have even invaded cities. The princess, skilled in the arts of magic, leaves the palace, determined to destroy the monsters, free her fellow magicians, and put an end to evil in Fail Land.&#201;toile Princesse is an overhead action game. It can be considered a shooter, since all the controllable characters can only fight with projectile attacks: Rilule shoots stars that damage enemies in a straight line, her first companion has an area wind attack, etc. As the player completes stages more magicians join the party. Up to three characters can be taken to explore hostile areas; however, the player can only select one character at a time, switching between them at will. Every character also possesses a unique powerful magic attack, which depletes MP and is activated by pressing down the action key and charging power. Health- and magic-restoring items can be found in chests or dropped by enemies. Stage progression is for the most part linear; each stage ends with a boss battle.</plot>

				<title_clean>Exterlien</title_clean>
				<plot>The plot of Exterlien is very simple: a beauty contest is held in an amusement park. Suddenly, monsters invade the park in an attempt to kidnap the girls. The protagonist, a young man named Masato, decides to venture into the dangerous zone and rescue the beauties.Exterlien has turn-based battles against monsters, but it cannot be qualified as an RPG due to the extreme simplicity of the combat. The player should simply figure out which attack damages the monster most. There are no experience points, physical exploration, money, equipment, or any other essential RPG elements. The core gameplay is that of a Japanese menu-driven adventure: choose which location to go to, select the best attacks against a monster, be rewarded with erotic (very "softcore") images of the rescued girls.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The ship Opa-Opa.In contrast to the many dark fantasy and sci-fi shooters of its time, Fantasy Zone had bright and colorful pastel environments and enemies that were strange and often abstract looking.Gameplay-wise it is pretty standard for the genre, but with some twists such as being able to walk on the ground. Upgrades are bought from shops appearing in the world as red balloons with the word shop on them. All the power-ups are temporary, but are powerful enough to be of considerable help when clearing the larger enemies needed to progress to the stage's boss.Fantasy Zone was originally an Arcade game but was ported to several consoles, not just those made by Sega. The gameplay was mostly the same in all versions, but the graphic quality varied depending on the platform.The 1986 Sega Master System version is the first SMS game to be released in the standard cartridge format, rather than the Super Card format the system had used up until that point. The cartridge allowed for a lot more memory, and Fantasy Zone was able to exploit this feature. The Famicom version is an official port by Sunsoft but the US NES version is an unlicensed Tengen release. The game was also released on the TurboGrafx-16 as well as appearing in multiple Sega compilations for more powerful systems.Virtual ConsoleThe Master System port of Fantasy Zone was released on the Wii Virtual Console on March 11th 2008 in Japan, April 11th in Europe and April 14th in the US.3D ClassicsIn March 2014, Sega released a 3D Classics version on the Nintendo 3DS eShop as part of the second run of Sega 3D Classics remastered to be displayed in stereoscopic 3D for the platform.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Final Fight</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]CPS arcade versionFinal Fight first appeared as a 1989 arcade game released by Capcom for their CPS hardware. It is a side-scrolling beat-em up with attacks consisting mainly of simple punching and kicking, as well as grabs, throws, aerial attacks and special moves which clear the area around the player while draining a small amount of health. Knives, swords and pipes can also be used. In the original arcade release, there are three playable characters: Cody, Haggar , and Guy.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Damnd Taunting HaggerThe story revolves around a street gang known as Mad Gear kidnapping Jessica, who is Haggar's daughter and Cody's girlfriend. Instead of giving in to the gang, Haggar, Cody, and Cody's training partner, Guy, take to the streets of Metro City to destroy the gang and rescue Jessica. The player fights through the streets, through the subway system, through a wrestling ring, and eventually fight all the way the leader of the Mad Gear gang's mansion. The final boss is the leader of the Mad Gear gang on a wheelchair with Jessica on his lap rolling around and shooting the heroes with a crossbow. The trio eventually beat him out of his chair and kick him through the large window he is standing next to.[CR]Hardware[CR]An original Final Fight arcade machineFinal Fight was originally on Capcom's CPS arcade hardware. It featured a dedicated cabinet with a control panel that had two buttons and a 8-way joystick. Although three characters where selectable only two player could play at a single cabinet. Cabinet Colors varied but where typically black, with large character graphics where featured on the side.[CR]Ports Sequels and Emulation[CR]The SNES version of Final FightThe SNES version, released in North America in 1991, disappointed many because it dropped the co-op play, removing arguably the most attractive element of the game and it also removes Guy as a playable character. Though a second version was later released in 1994, called Final Fight: Guy, where Guy was a playable character and Cody was not. This version was available as a rental-only game from Blockbuster video stores.It was recently discovered that two variations of Final Fight: Guy exist- the common "orange box", and the rarer "black box." There is a lot of confusion as to where these black box version came from, and very few have ever been found. Theories express that it could have been the original color of the box until an exclusive deal was later made with Blockbuster or that it was a Canadian variant, despite it being marked as available in the US. This small variation can make these versions of the game very valuable from a collector's standpoint.Two sequels, Final Fight 2 and Final Fight 3, were released on the SNES in 1993 and 1995, respectively.The game was re-released on the Game Boy Advance as Final Fight One. Final Fight: One featured small dialog exchanges before boss fights, unlockable features, and the Street Fighter: Alpha versions of Cody ,and Guy.Final Fight: Double Impact was a PSN and XBLA game that was attached with Magic Sword.The game was also released as part of the 'Capcom Arcade' on iOS ( iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad) in 2011.[CR]Playable Characters[CR]HaggarThe big slow strong character of Final Fight. His optimal weapon is the pipe, and has a piledriver and spinning lariat. He is the mayor of Metro City as well as Jessica's Father.CodyThe middle of the road character of Final Fight. His optimal weapon is the knife, he is the only character able to use the knife without throwing it. He uses a jumping spin kick, and is Jessica's boyfriend.GuyThe fast character of Final Fight. His optimal weapon is the Katana. He uses a jumping spin kick similar to Cody's. Guy is a friend of Cody's[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]Metro City as it appears in Final Fight (CPS arcade version)There are six stages in the first Final Fight all taking place in Metro City.Stage one - SlumStage two - SubwayStage three - West SideStage four - Industrial AreaStage Five - Bay AreaStage six - Up TownBonus Stages:The first bonus stage takes place in a gas station in between level two and three, where the player destroys a thugs car as fast as they can within the time limit.The glass panes factory is the second bonus stage, it takes place between level five and six, where the player is to destroy all of the glass panes in the factory within the time limit.[CR]Boss Characters[CR]DamndDamnd is the first level boss, as well as the character that Haggar talks to in the attract screen.*In the SNES version his name was changed to Thrasher.SodomSodom is the Second level boss. He uses two swords that can be knocked out of his hands and used against him. He would later appear as a playable character in Street Fighter Apha.*In some regions he is known as Katana.Edi.EEdi.E is the third stage boss. The gum he spits out at the start of the fight can be eaten to regain health.RolentoThe boss of the fouth stage. He is fought on a elevator while enemies and weapons fall down from above.AbigailAbigail is the boss of the fifth stage.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]First Queen is a 1988 PC-9801 RPG that combines traditional turn-based RPG gameplay with large-scale strategic battles. This game, the first in Kure Software's First Queen series, introduced the Gochyakyara ("Multiple Characters") system that allowed many AI companions to fight alongside the player character.The game originated on Japanese computers and would eventually see updated releases for the Super Famicom in 1994 (as First Queen: Ornic Senki) and a Windows PC graphically-enhanced remake in 2001. The game is also known for its involvement with artist Yoshitaka Amano, who would be better known for his work with Square's Final Fantasy.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In the near future, mankind has abandoned the Earth, which has become unsuitable for human life. Human beings began to build space stations. Thanks to the new space suits invented by professor Toujou, which allowed unrestricted presence in the space, humans could eventually spread over the galaxy. The planet Charon became the new center of science and culture.But soon, a mysterious organization known as "Giras" appeared on the stage. Their troops attempted to invade Charon, and at the same time professor Toujou has gone missing. His niece Lisa was determined to continue his research and discover his whereabouts; but was herself kidnapped by the Giras. Two of her friends, Kyouhei and Kamui, decided to lead an assault on a Giras stronghold and rescue Lisa...Foxy 2 is a turn-based strategy game. The gameplay is similar to its  predecessor; it is confined to large-scale strategic battles, in which the player commands different types of units, in an attempt to reach the enemy base, protect his own, and exterminate all enemy units. Like in the first game, the units have distinct strengths and weaknesses, as well as attack range. The game includes even more various types of units, including the traditional infantry, rocket launchers (mobile and stationary), different kinds of tanks, planes, helicopters, etc.The plot is more elaborate than in the first game, and the cut-scenes between the battles typically include more plot-related information. Scenes with nudity and mild sexual content are kept intact.</plot>

				<title_clean>Future Wars - Adventures in Time</title_clean>
				<plot>In the year 1989, a simple window cleaner is working outside of a skyscraper. Intending to play a prank on his angry boss, the unlikely hero discovers a secret passage leading to a time machine along with mysterious alien documents. Operating the device transports the protagonist to the year 1304, where he is given a seemingly ordinary task of rescuing a lady in danger. However, he soon finds out about a much more serious threat of a global alien invasion. The hero has to travel to the remote future of the 44th century and eventually to the even more remote past of the Cretaceous period to foil their plans.Future Wars is a graphic adventure game, and the first to use Delphine's proprietary Cinematique point-and-click interface. A right click brings up the verb menu. After choosing one of the six commands, the player points the mouse over the desired target and executes the action with a left click. Small objects are depicted by enlarged drawings once they have been discovered; however, many of them are well-hidden and often require precise positioning on the part of the player character to discover. The game has a linear story advancement, and it is possible to die or become irrevocably stuck by failing to locate a crucial item in one of the previous locations.</plot>

				<plot>Gakuen Bomber begins with a dream; more precisely, the dream the protagonist of the game, an ordinary Japanese high-school boy, is having: that of his sister having passionate sex with... a female classmate. Since afterwards he begins to dream about spaceships and aliens, he assumes that dream had nothing to do with reality... or has it? Exploring the high school he attends, the hero makes some startling and not very unpleasant discoveries...Gakuen Bomber is set almost entirely in the high-school, and mostly consists of the protagonist wandering around and triggering event scenes (often of sexual nature) that advance the story. However, the player is given considerable freedom to explore the rather large school compounds, interacting with many on-screen objects in point-and-click fashion. </plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Galaga '88 (Galaga '90 for the TG-16) is a graphically enhanced version of the original Galaga. It received multiple graphical updates, including the player's ship, the enemies, more elaborate backgrounds and other details. New features include the ability to "triple" the player's ship, by shooting down an enemy attempting to abduct the player's dual-ship: this is a continuation of the original game's dual-ship feature. Another new feature is the ability to hop dimensions: moving to another dimension increases the player's score, but also the difficulty. Dimensional travel is made possible by collecting blue power-ups from destroyed enemies.Galaga '88 was originally released in the Arcades. It was later ported to the TG-16/PCE and the Game Gear in Europe and Japan. It also appears in Namco compilations, like the Galaga 30th Anniversary Collection (Mobile), Namco Museum 50th Anniversary (PS2/Xbox/GameCube/PC) and the Namco Museum Virtual Arcade (XBLA). It's also one of the Arcade games featured in Pac-Man's Arcade Party. The TurboGrafx-16 version was added to the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Gaudi - Barcelona no Kaze</title_clean>
				<plot>Gaudi: Barcelona no Kaze was the first adventure developed by  Wolf Team. It takes place in the Spanish city of Barcelona, which just the year before the release of the game was chosen for the celebration of the 25th Olympic Games. This is important to mention as the game takes place in the summer of 1992, the time at which the Olympic Games were being held in Barcelona.The game is a classic graphical adventure with static images and text, with the occasional appearance of small menus that ask you which action you want to execute next. Hard-boiled stories will be touching each corner of the most emblematic spaces of the city (which had been digitalized for the occasion, with special mention to the monuments designed by Spanish architect Antoni Gaud&#237;). The stories have all the elements of a thriller, including terrorist attacks, characters with a dark past, romance, crime, etc. all this accompanied by elegant Latin jazz throughout the adventure. </plot>

				<plot>Humans and aliens are living in harmony in the future, until a tabloid journalist stirs up hatred towards aliens. They respond by invading the planet, and it's down to the protagonist to clear up a situation scarily similar to reality in this arcade conversion.Gemini Wing is a vertically-scrolling shoot 'em up, which is distinguished by its unusual power-up system. Instead of gaining occasional tokens which lead to lasting weaponry improvements, occasional flurries of tokens are released to ensure a quick burst of improved fire. The organic backgrounds are detailed, and have many sections which fire at the player character.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Genocide 2 is a side-scrolling action game featuring a 12m mech charging through a number of locations wielding a laser sword. It was originally released in 1991 for the Sharp X68000 with the subtitle Master of the Dark Communion, and was later ported to the Super Famicom in 1994 with the prefix "G2" (thought to be a reference to the Terminator 2 movie, colloquially known as T2).

However, their true plan was global conquest, and now the only man who can stop CONEX is the same pilot who saved the world the first time around.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player takes control of the mechanical suit called the Tracer.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Genpei Touma Den, given the official localization title The Genji and the Heike Clans in a 1997 rerelease, is an 1986 Arcade brawler from Namco and one of the earliest examples of the genre. The player, as the resurrected spirit of historical ninja Taira no Kagekiyo of the Heike clan, must defeat the (now ruling) Genji clan which had wiped out the Heike prior to the game's events. The player runs across the screen slashing enemies and avoiding obstacles from all directions, eventually reaching a torii (shrine gate) that leads to the next level.Genpei Touma Den was first ported to the Japanese home computer the Sharp X68000 in 1988 in a more or less Arcade-perfect conversion. It received a PC Engine port in 1990 from Now Productions, which is the version that would eventually be rereleased in Namco Museum Vol. 4, and is subsequently the version most familiar to the US. The PC Engine version was also rereleased on the Wii's Virtual Console in Japan.The game saw a couple of console-exclusive sequels. On the Famicom, Genpei Touma Den: Computer Boardgame is a board game spin-off. The direct sequel Genpei Touma Den: Kan no Ni (best known in the US as Samurai Ghost) was released exclusively for the PC Engine and its American equivalent the TurboGrafx-16.The Genji and the Heike Clans is a touchstone in Namco's video game development history, along with formative titles such as The Tower of Druaga and Pac-Man, and given Namco's propensity to revisit their legacy games in contemporary titles such as Tales and crossovers like Namco x Capcom, both Genpei Touma Den and its protagonist Taira no Kagekiyo have appeared multiple times as references and/or cameos.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>This is the first in  Bothtec's  series of games based on the anime adaptation of Yoshiki Tanaka's science fiction novel cycle Legend of the Galactic Heroes. The games are set in the fictional future as depicted in the novels: humanity has spread all over the Milky Way, and split into two powerful states which are having a permanent war with each other: the Galactic Empire, and the Free Planets Alliance. Two genius strategists are leading the forces of their respective states: Reinhard von M&#252;sel for the Empire, and Yang Wenli for the Alliance.The game is dedicated entirely to large-scale strategic battles and is not particularly story-driven. There are five different scenarios to choose from, which put the player in control of either Imperial or Alliance forces and revolve around "historical" battles based on the novels' lore, with exact dates and victory conditions.The combat takes place between space ships, and is set entirely in outer space. The player usually takes control of a "home planet", which is able to deploy a limited number of units. The player then navigates the units in turn-based fashion on the top-down map. Enemies typically appear after a few turns; depending on the goal, the player must prevent them from invading planets, destroy them, have his own ships invade a planet, etc. The space ships come in different flavors: high-speed battle ships, cruisers, supply ships, etc. Each ship has different mobility, attack range, weapons, defense parameters, etc. Actual combat is displayed on a separate screen and is automatic. The player usually has a choice to use different weapons (cannons, missiles, etc.) against the enemy ships.</plot>

				<plot>The second game in the  series based on the anime adaptation of Yoshiki Tanaka's Legend of the Galactic Heroes novels. The novels (and the games) are set in a futuristic world, where humanity has conquered the entire Milky Way and split into two powerful warring states, each encompassing different systems and planets: the Galactic Empire (modeled after Bismark's 19th century Prussia), and the democratic Free Planets Alliance. The game plays very similarly to its  predecessor: the player selects a scenario and tries to fulfill the victory requirements it imposes. There are five possible scenarios in the game. Unlike the first game, there is an option to choose which space fleet to control (Imperial or Alliance) for each scenario. The player takes control of planets allied with the chosen state. It is possible to deploy an entire fleet of a planet into the battle, or have it supply separate units. The players navigates the units (space ships of different kinds) on the top-down map in turn-based fashion, attacking or defending against enemy ships. The ship encounters are automatic and displayed as small animated cut-scenes. There are more ship types than the previous game, more different animations during battles, and detailed characteristics and portraits for various generals fighting for the two states.</plot>

				<plot>A young adventurer is walking through the desert. Nothing but sand everywhere - it's hard to believe that 500 years ago a powerful civilization based on magic existed there, the miraculous land of Grad. Rumors of ancient magical items still hidden somewhere in this place have brought the young man to this barren wasteland. But the only thing he finds is a strange disc. As he picks it up, the disc glows, and a young girl appears in front of the astonished traveler. She says that her name is Physis and that she must find the underground palace of Grad, refusing to explain more. The hero, being the gentleman that he is, offers his help as the bodyguard. Physis leads the way, and together they venture into the deep, dark dungeon...Gize! XIX is a first-person dungeon-crawler with very simple gameplay. Most of the game is spent in the same location - the underground passages of the ancient Grad. The player navigates the hero through maze-like passages, with only his compass helping him to find the right way. Enemies appear randomly and are fought in turn-based combat. There are no equipment, items, or money in the game. Healing can be performed only though magic. Various companions will join the hero and offer their assistance in battles (such as healing spells). Only one companion can join at a time. The hero and Physis level up automatically after having accumulated enough experience points from defeated enemies.The game contains nudity and sexual situations during some of the cut-scenes, but no explicit "hardcore" scenes.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Gradius is a side scrolling shooter, a spiritual successor to Scramble, and the first in the Gradius franchise. Players control a ship called the Vic Viper through multiple space stages. The enemies encountered include a large array of alien ships and creatures which try to collide into the Vic Viper or shoot it down. Luckily, throughout each stage power-ups are collected by shooting down certain color enemies. Power-ups are saved up on a power meter on the bottom of the player's screen. Once a player reaches the power-up cell that they wish to buy, it can be obtained by pressing the select button (NES release). The power-up cells include:Speed Up: Increases the movement speed of the Vic Viper. Missile: Drops missiles to kill ground targets with every shot.Double: Shoots two cannon shots at once rather than one shot.Laser: Replaces the standard cannon shot with a laser beam.Option: Creates a hovering orange ball that follows the Vic Viper doubling its firepower with each Option.?: Provides a  shield on the front of the ship.At the end of each stage a boss battle takes place where, more often than not, the Vic Viper must shoot at its core to destroy it. Many of these bosses have shields that protect their core that the player must destroy before being able to lay waste to the core itself.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The NES version was the first game to ever include the  Konami code.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In the year 2016, war has broken out in Africa over mining rights to rare metal. Machines of destruction called "maneuver cepters" have been developed as the primary force, but recently a mysterious maneuver cepter has appeared in the northern territories. It is known by the name of "Granada", and has been destroying the weapons of the factions on both sides. You are this machine's pilot, a man by the name of Leon Todo.Granada is a free-roaming scrolling shooter. You control the titular maneuver cepter Granada as you make your way through each stage, destroying the enemy's weapons. You have a map that tells you where your targets are on the stage, and once all the targets have been destroyed a large boss enemy appears which must also be destroyed. You are equipped with a standard cannon, as well as a more powerful blaster that will actually push your machine backwards with the recoil. There are also assist pickups which will follow you and reflect any shots you fire at it toward the nearest enemies.Of special note is the fixed cannon feature. Using this feature, you can hold the direction of fire while still moving freely. The game has nine stages and three difficulty levels.</plot>

				<title_clean>Guerriere Lyeward</title_clean>
				<plot>After World War III, humans have finally achieved world peace - or so they thought. Malevolent aliens have infected the human organism in a most treacherous way possible, turning young and pretty women into rampaging, violent nymphomaniacs. Only one person can stop the insanity - the attractive secret agent with the codename Lyew&#228;rd.Guerri&#232;re Lyew&#228;rd is a side-scrolling beat-em-up. The gameplay is very simple: the player moves the protagonist through strictly linear stages from left to right, each containing a few types of female enemies that attack the heroine from both sides. The secret agent can punch, kick, and jump. Power-ups such as health-restoring hearts and invincibility appear at set points during the stages, floating in the air. Each stage culminates with a boss battle against a powerful female enemy; defeating the boss leads to a lesbian sex scene.</plot>

				<title_clean>Gunship</title_clean>
				<plot>Gunship depicts one of the Western world's finest attack helicopters: The AH-64A Apache. This simulation recreates the weapons, flight systems, and performance of the real machine. The player controls an arsenal that includes laser-guided Hellfire missiles, a 30mm cannon controlled by helmet gunsights, clusters of bombardment rockets--even air-to-air missiles for duels with enemy helicopters.The game starts with flight training at a base in the United States. Tutorials teach the player to handle the copter; once the controls and flying skills are mastered, there are escalating challenges and hundreds of missions in any one of four regions of the world, including Southeast Asia, Central America, the Middle East, and the Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies in Western Europe.</plot>

The game begins with the girls deciding how to spend the holiday. From that point on, depending on the player's choices, the story splits into three vignettes: going to see an erotic movie, buying shoes, or reading erotic books. Each story invariably concludes with a sex scene.</plot>

				<plot>[CR]Synopsis[CR]In the future, Earth has been all but exhausted of her resources and the environment is in shambles. Suddenly, a benevolent race of advanced aliens from the planet Akirov step in. They claim to have been observing humanity and have intervened, repaired the environment, and taught us to travel further into space. Sadly the Akirovians were only preparing to take over the Earth. we fought back and eventually drove them back out of our solar system. Our victory was due largely to re-appropriated technology, Heavy D.O.L.L.s (Defensive Offensive Lethal Liberator). Giant, remote controlled, robots used not only for military purposes, but also in any task too dangerous for a human. Now, in 2120, the most desired military rank is that of the top Heavy D.O.L.L. operator. That rank is known as "Heavy Nova", you play as a character attempting to have this rank bestowed upon you.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Gengorou Imai is a 19-year old lad who wants to have a simple life, his only passion being young pretty women. He stays in a boarding house in the country, enjoying the quiet life, the sea, the beach, and the abundance of those he likes most... So all goes well, until one of the guests who was staying at the boarding house is killed. Not entirely trusting the police, the owner of the boarding house asks Gen to look into this. Gen knows that the deceased was having a relationship with the owner's daughter. The young man begins his investigation, saying good-bye to quiet life - but not to the seductive young female tenants of the boarding house...Hoshi no Suna Monogatari is the first in the  series of adult detective/mystery adventures by  D.O.. The game world is composed of still screens viewed from first-person perspective; navigation is done by selecting locations from a menu. At every screen, a full list of commands is available, from the standard "Look" and "Talk" to the more specific "Kiss", as well as "Ask", "Use Item", and "Show Item". Advancing in the game usually means investigating the locations, talking to everyone, asking the right person about the right topic, and showing the right person the right item. </plot>

				<plot>The second entry in the adult detective/mystery  series describes another case in the life of the young amateur detective and nearly professional seducer of pretty women, Gengorou Imai. The stage of events is once again a boarding house in the country, this time in the winter season, with skiing and other attractions. Gen is having a good time with the young, but "demanding" Reiko Honda, when the news strike: a family friend, a young foreigner named Eddie, is stabbed by an unknown assailant. The only clue Gen can find right away are strange letters written in blood: H and O. What do they mean? Why would anyone want to harm the young boy? With the help of the many pretty girls at the boarding house and its surroundings, Gen begins the investigation, determined to find the criminal...Hoshi no Suna Monogatari 2 plays almost identically to the  first game, the only interface-related difference being the addition of a mouse. Otherwise, the player follows the same procedure: look at everything; talk to everyone; find the items needed to advance the investigation; ask the right person the right question, and show the right item to the right person - all done by selecting commands and topics from the extensive verb menu.</plot>

				<plot>A magical world populated by supernatural creatures exists alongside ours. Once in a while a portal between the two opens. Demons known as BEMs ("big-eyed monsters") have stolen precious jewels and escaped to Earth through that portal. It is up to two demon hunters, Lime and Bass, to assume the likeness of a teenage girl and boy and restore peace and order.The twelfth episode of the series is, like its predecessors, an interactive cartoon with visual novel elements. The interaction is sparse, consisting of repeatedly selecting simple verb commands from a menu and triggering animated cutscenes.In this episode Lime, Bass and Kokona depart to the magical world for the final confrontation against two powerful demons and their horrifying fusion known as the Hellraiser.</plot>

				<plot>In the beginning of 21th century a terrible disaster, called "demon-coming crisis", devastated the Asian continent. Hong Kong was most affected by the mysterious demonic attack. Terrible diseases turned the once prosperous city into a pale shadow of itself. But once people came back to see what happened to the isolated city, they saw it was ruled by a new order - a corporation called SIVA. The new order proclaimed New Hong Kong to be an independent state. People's Republic of China and United Kingdom signed an agreement in which they both renounced their claims over the city. The player takes on the role of Tianren, a "diver" (demon-hunter) who lives in Hong Kong. His place of birth and the identity of his parents are unknown. Together with a girl named Meihong, he was brought up in the house of a wise Master. Traveling through the huge city, gathering information and fighting demonic forces, Tianren will have to unravel the mystery surrounding the corporation SIVA and the supernatural beings from Chinese myths.Illusion City is a Japanese-style role-playing game with several distinguishing characteristics. Unlike most games of the genre, it has no overworld, and takes place entirely in a vast city divided into several districts. The player advances the story by exploring the city, talking to non-playable characters, gathering information, receiving missions, and eventually heading into large, complex hostile areas. There are no random battles in the game; all enemies are visibly moving on the field, and many of them can be avoided.Combat is turn-based, utilizing an "over-the-shoulder" perspective similar to that of Phantasy Star II. Characters join the party as dictated by the plot; an active party includes three combatants. A wide variety of weapon and armor types can be purchased or found in dungeons. Each character has his or her own weapon proficiencies, which can be increased by repeatedly using the same weapon type. Firearms require specific ammunition (e.g. bullets, shotgun cartridges, etc.), which is expended in combat and must be re-stocked. In addition, certain characters can use offensive, supportive, and healing techniques.The game's visual style aims for realistic presentation of locations and characters, and shares more common traits with contemporary Western visual aesthetics than the traditional Japanese anime art.</plot>

				<plot>Image consists of three short episodes; each episode, in its turn, contains two different scenarios. The two scenarios within each episode are similar to each other, featuring the same main female character, and sharing many of the scenes (mostly of sexual nature); however, the identity of the protagonist, the circumstances leading to the development of the story, the dialogue, and the commands required to choose in order to complete the scenario are different.All the three episodes are rather minimalistic, featuring only the protagonist and the female character; the object is always to have sex with the latter. The first episode introduces a girl from the tennis club, the protagonist being either an older boy or a younger classmate. The second revolves around a female high school student who stays in the school after classes; the protagonist can be a male classmate or a male teacher. Finally, the third episode is dedicated to the lovely school nurse, with the protagonist taking two alternate routes to win her graces.The gameplay usually involves selecting verbs from command menus with different options and sometimes vast sub-menus of objects. The sex scenes (and some others) are handled through a point-and-click interface, with the player selecting an appropriate command ("Look", "Touch", "Kiss", etc.), and clicking on an object on the screen to interact with. Many choices the player is able to make in the game are "wrong", leading to Game Over.</plot>

				<title_clean>Inindou - Datou Nobunaga</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Inindo: Way of the Ninja, or Inindo Datou Nobunaga in Japan, is a fantasy JRPG that is based loosely on the Warring States Era of Japanese history. The premise of the game sees the player control of a band of heroes and mercenaries in a quest to defeat the tyrannical daimyo Nobunaga Oda before he can conquer all of Japan.Koei developed and published the game for many home systems as a companion for their more realistic Nobunaga's Ambition series of strategy war sims set in the same historical period. It was eventually remade with better graphics for the SNES, where it is known as Super Inindo Datou Nobunaga in Japan.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game uses a turn-based combat system to fight battles while exploring dungeons. Many of the game's dungeons are optional, but the player must take risks. The game features a time limit, and the player's party must be sufficiently leveled and powered up if Nobunaga is to be defeated before the time limit expires. This means that the player must be willing to take on optional content to increase the party's strength without allowing too much time to pass.[CR]</plot>

There are ways to play that can dramatically increase the score, which makes the game very strategic in nature.  Additionally, when desired, the player can get an oracle reading by asking a question, which is answered when the player makes a very elegant play (four-way match).  There is also a "construction set" where players can create their own tiles and backgrounds. The game comes with numerous tile sets and backgrounds.</plot>

				<title_clean>Ishin no Arashi</title_clean>
				<plot>Ishin no Arashi is set during Bakumatsu period (around 1850 until the Meiji Restoration of 1867), the final stretch of the Japanese Edo period, which was a turbulent time, a time of great struggle between the supporters of the feudal shoguns, the rulers of the country, and the adherents of the Emperor, which eventually won and carried through the Meiji Restoration, turning Japan into a modern, powerful state. In Ishin no Arashi the player can choose one of the three major battles of Bakumastu period, and decide which leader will eventually propel Japan towards the Meiji era.This strategy game is somewhat similar to the better-known  Romance of the Three Kingdoms series and other  historical simulation games by  the same company, but also differs from them by having much less complex diplomacy options and focusing the gameplay on navigation and individual encounters. Before beginning, the player chooses a general and customizes his parameters (stamina, attack power, charisma, knowledge). The player then controls the general with soldiers of his choice, navigating him on grids representing towns and countryside of Japan in turn-based fashion. The grids can be occupied by shops, schools (to train the general), friendly and hostile characters and groups. Battles, as well as negotiations and diplomatic procedures, are carried out automatically, and their outcome depends on the characters' statistics.</plot>

				<title_clean>Jesus II</title_clean>
				<plot>On board the ship Callisto, sailing through the Mediterranean Sea, are two friends from Japan - Kazuya Goshiki and Shinji Saeki, on their way to Monaco, where they want to compete in a motor race using their three-wheel drive. Suddenly, the ship stops moving. Kazuya talks to the captain and finds out that a large container has just dropped from the sky into the sea. Most of the passengers assume it was junk thrown out of a space ship; but shortly afterwards, several crew members are murdered under mysterious circumstances. Kazuya begins to see a connection to a Halley's Comet incident that happened four years ago, and realizes things are much worse than anyone else would assume...Jesus II is a sequel to Jesus: Ky&#333;fu no Bio-Monster. Though the setting and the protagonists are different, characters from the previous game appear in the sequel as well. Gameplay-wise, Jesus II is a Japanese-style adventure with a large amount of dialogue and very simple interaction: the player is only able to choose basic commands such as "Examine", "Talk", "Move", etc., without the possibility of selecting objects to interact with. Most of the game consists of visiting various locations on the ship, and talking to characters, gradually unraveling the mystery.</plot>

				<title_clean>Joker</title_clean>
				<plot>Joker is set in the time period commonly known as the "Old West" or "Wild West" in the United States of America. The protagonist of the game is a young man nicknamed Wild, who lives in a quiet Native American village. Years ago, the village was hit by something its inhabitants have since called "The Great Disaster". In order to seal the forces that caused the catastrophe, Wild's father sacrificed his own life. Now, the ceremonial day of the White Magic approaches. The youngest in the line of witches, a girl named Laura, must predict the future for the village and the world. For an unknown reason, Laura is unable to see into the future. Concerned, the village elder sends Wild on a mission to the nearby town, to find out what could cause this and if there is a way to prevent the Great Disaster from returning...Joker is essentially a Japanese-style adventure, with strictly menu-based interface, still screens viewed from first-person perspective, and no real puzzles. However, the game offers more interaction possibilities and less linear progression than it is usually the case in comparable games. The player must explore the town and talk to its inhabitants in order to advance the story and get to the bottom of the mystery.The game has scenes with nudity and rather mild depictions of sexual situations.</plot>

				<title_clean>Joker II</title_clean>
				<plot>Joker II continues the story that started in  Joker. In the end of the first game, the young hero Wild had to confront the sorceress Claudia, who intended to resurrect the evil Joker, which caused what the Native Americans of the region called "The Great Disaster". Six months have passed since the tragic outcome of those events. Wild is taken care by his friends and companions. The same nightmare pursues him: he sees his sweetheart Laura calling for him, begging him to save her... Wild has to rebuild his life from scratch, but this nightmare ties him to his past... so he ventures out to look for answers once again.Gameplay-wise, Joker II is pretty much identical to its predecessor. It is a Japanese-style adventure without puzzles, but with more interaction and exploration possibilities than it is usually the case with games of its genre. Graphically the game also looks very similarly; since most of it takes place in the same locations, many images were simply transferred from the first game.Like its predecessor, Joker II has several scenes with nudity and mild sexual situations.</plot>

				<title_clean>Joshua</title_clean>
				<plot>Joshua is a grand strategy game set on the fictional semi-medieval continent of the same name. The people of Joshua are skilled in sciences and technology, which were used for good and evil purposes alike, leading to the invention of wondrous flying machines, but also mechanical war devices that allowed certain nations to take over large portions of the continent. The player can choose between any of the three scenarios, taking place during the fictional 10th to 12th centuries of Joshua's history. The earliest scenario puts the player in control of the small desert nation Rujua; in the middle one the ruler of the Principality of Ashumenia fights against the kingdom of Ishtakar; the final scenario takes place on a part of the continent occupied by the powerful Barm Empire, and the player must resist their invasion as the leader of the kingdom of Ans.The gameplay is similar to Koei's historical simulation games. Much of the interaction is menu-driven, as the player conducts interior policies, diplomacy, and military actions of the controlled state. As the ruler of a nation, the player has to keep the population happy, fortify cities, construct catapults for protection, train soldier, supply money and rations to the army, and engage in large-scale turn-based battles that take place on separate overhead screens.</plot>

				<title_clean>Karei Naru Jinsei Minasan no Okagedesu</title_clean>
				<plot>Karei naru Jinsei is a mixture of a board game and a dating simulation with adult content. Up to five players can compete in the board game, represented either by real players or computer AI. The board represents the life of a young male character; the different squares correspond to events that can influence his life and his relationships with the many female characters encountered on the way.The gameplay process is rather simple: each player starts a roulette, the resulting number being the number of squares the player in question moves on the linearly structured board. Beside empty squares, there are event squares with pictures; stopping on these raises the players' parameters. The squares can include money, fitness training, encounters with women, items, marriage, child birth, and even exotic choices as making a pact with the devil to raise a parameter.The player can also choose to give items to a girl of his choice. Girls will be impressed/dissatisfied with the player's actions; once a girl's parameters reach a certain level, the player is able to choose to "do the H thing" with her - in plain language, have sex.</plot>

Then he hears that Kawarazaki, a wealthy and powerful magnate, needs someone to take care of his mansion during his absence. When the boy arrives there, he is surprised to discover that the mansion is mostly populated by young attractive women - relatives, employees, maids, etc. Naturally, he is willing to concentrate on his job only inasmuch as it doesn't impede his advancements on the other "mission" - get friendly with every girl and... you know the drill. However, soon he begins to realize that something more sinister is going on in the mansion...Kawarazakike no Ichizoku is a visual novel. The entire gameplay consists of occasional selection of a response and/or action from a menu. The rest of the game is dedicated to text accompanied by still pictures. Depending on the player's choices, different cutscenes will be triggered, and the player will achieve different endings, including several "bad" ones.</plot>

				<title_clean>Kikou Shidan - Panzer Division</title_clean>
				<plot>Kik&#333; Shidan is a strategy game set during World War II, more specifically the year 1944. There are no concrete historical scenarios in the game and no allegiance to a particular faction on the player's side. All the battles take place in France, divided into smaller areas represented as icons on the overhead map. The player must prepare, customize, organize, and eventually send tanks to the battlefield. Once there, the player is given new options, which includes leaving the tank commanders to follow their own judgment, or instruct them precisely where to move.

				<title_clean>Kikou Shidan - Panzer Division</title_clean>
				<plot>Kik&#333; Shidan is a strategy game set during World War II, more specifically the year 1944. There are no concrete historical scenarios in the game and no allegiance to a particular faction on the player's side. All the battles take place in France, divided into smaller areas represented as icons on the overhead map. The player must prepare, customize, organize, and eventually send tanks to the battlefield. Once there, the player is given new options, which includes leaving the tank commanders to follow their own judgment, or instruct them precisely where to move. A certain amount of time passes with each turn, and the player-controlled forces may be attacked by enemy tanks, planes, etc.</plot>

				<title_clean>Kimi Dake ni Ai o...</title_clean>
				<plot>It's a cause for celebration: the lovely Misa has decided to marry her sweetheart Satoshi. Former schoolmates attend the wedding ceremony. But not all of them are unconditionally happy for the couple. Among those is the protagonist of the game, a young man named Akio, who has always looked up to Satoshi and considered him his older brother. Does Akio harbor "forbidden" feelings to the one whom he must now treat as sister?..Kimi Dake ni Ai o... is a Japanese-style adventure. The player choose verb commands from a menu ("Examine", "Talk", "Think", "Move", etc.), which in turn lead to lists of themes and objects. Usually the next event is triggered when the player has gone through all possible verb/object combinations; sometimes, a more unrestricted navigation is possible. The game has explicit sex sequences, during which the verb commands change into rather detailed sexual instructions, with "objects" to match.</plot>

				<plot>With Al Capone out of the picture, Chicago's prohibition-era profit is up for grabs. Are you merciless and cunning enough to gain it by whatever means are required? Every action you take has complex long-term consequences which are not always obvious at the time.You must keep your people on your side, watching what you say and do, knowing that an overthrow could be hatched at any moment. Look after your woman as well - who's going to respect a single mobster? The money has to be juggled in these ways, not forgetting to reach an 'understanding' with the Mayor to avoid any negative attentions. </plot>

				<plot>Knight Arms: The Hyblid Framer (sic) is a shoot-em-up in which the player controls a flying mecha who has to venture into deep space to sabotage alien installations and eventually save the Earth. The game's stand-out feature are its two gameplay modes. When in space, the protagonist is controlled from an over-the-shoulder third-person view in a 3D environment. Forward movement is automated, but changing altitude to engage aerial enemies in combat or blast stationary machines is essential. Once in an indoor environment, the player character is navigated in a more common side-scrolling fashion, though altitude continues to play an important role. Power-ups include health-restoring items (repair kits), additional weaponry, etc.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Rise of the Phoenix (JP: Kouryuuki) is a strategy simulation game based on the historical Ancient Chinese event the Chu-Han Contention, which occurred between 206-202 BCE. The player can assume the role of either Xiang Yu or Liu Bang. Unlike Koei's other Ancient Chinese-set strategy game, Romance of the Three Kingdoms (which usually begins around 185 CE, during the Yellow Turban Rebellion), Rise of the Phoenix splits the player's turn between "planning" and "action": the former for determining who to ally and where to bulk up defense, while the latter involves moving units around and triggering battles.Rise of the Phoenix originally came out on the NEC PC-9801 in 1993, followed by releases for the Sharp X68000, FM Towns and PC. The following year saw a Super Famicom version, with a US SNES release following in 1995. An enhanced PlayStation version was released in 1998. The game has also seen a few anniversary releases on PC.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Kurutta Kajitsu</title_clean>
				<plot>The young Satoshi Kanou attends  a prestigious art school. One day, the students are invited to a party in Professor Tsukishima's mansion. The hero becomes acquainted with the professor's young daughter, and her father eventually hires him as a private tutor. But it all goes wrong when a terrible accident involves the young hero into a net of mystery and intrigues. Soon he realizes that an innocent person's life might be in danger. The private tutor becomes a private detective...Kurutta Kajitsu is a rather standard Japanese-style adventure gameplay-wise. Typically for the genre, the player advances the story by repeatedly selecting verb commands ("Examine", "Talk", etc.) from a menu. Most of the time the player is free to move between various locations (also menu-wise) to explore the game world, talk to characters, and solve the mystery. The game has scenes with nudity and sexual content.</plot>

It first debuted on the Sharp X68000 home computer in 1990 before becoming one of the Super Nintendo's earliest JRPGs the following year.The two versions have a handful of differences: the X68000 version has animated cutscenes, and the player character Nasir automatically attacks enemies if he attacks them at the right angle (similar to early Ys games) whereas in the SNES version the player needs to swing Nasir's weapon with a button.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Taken directly from Lagoon's North American SNES manual, the story for the game is as follows:Who shall rise to face this threat?Long ago the peaceful land of Lakeland fell under the influence of an evil spirit, bringing despair to all. With compassion, the gods descended and vanquished the evil spirit with the sacred Moon Blade Sword. In hopes of restoring peace to Lakeland, the gods brought two babies to the land: one who represented the forces of Light, and another who represented the forces of Darkness. A sage named Mathias was charged with the responsibility of raising the two children as equals in the hope that their different, but equivalent strengths would guarantee the balance of the forces of Light and Darkness. But, the moment Mathias reached out to grasp the two children, the evil Zerah appeared and took the child of Darkness, hoping to raise the child to overcome the forces of Light. This, while Nasir, the Champion of Light, was raised by the wise Mathias, the other child grew up under the questionable tutelage of Zerah. Fourteen years have passed. Nasir, raised near the village of Atland, has become a bright youth and accomplished swordsman. Mathias has taught him well. One day, an evil spirit possessed the water on which the people of Lakeland depend, bringing sickness and disease. Demons infest this once peaceful land.Mathias spoke haltingly."It is for this day that I have trained you, Nasir. You must discover what evil force possesses and fouls the water. Restore the purity of the water or sickness and death will plague our land. This is your destiny!"It is now your responsibility to rescue the land from the evil forces. You will face a myriad of enemies. Only by skillfully using your sword, magic, and wits will you prevail. Go forth, your quest awaits you.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Players can move Nasir in one of four directions, and can also attack, jump, jump and attack, defend, or cast magic from each position. Of particular note, is the short range of Nasir's melee attacks. This is offset by the range of his magic attacks, which can reach the whole length of the screen. However, players may not rely on magic attacks alone. Certain enemies are invulnerable to it (like bosses), and must be dispatched with melee attacks.The basic gameflow of Lagoon follows a town-overworld-dungeon pattern. In each town, players can talk to the various townspeople, buy items and equipment, and advance the game. On the overworld, players fight their way from location to location, sometimes having previous areas being permanently blocked. In the dungeons, which range from such locales as mines, castles, dungeons, and various elemental caves, players must seek items, equipment, and the bosses within.The equipment and item system borrows heavily from Ys. As such, Lagoon has a very limited set of equipment to find, with only five pieces of equipment per sword, armor, and shield categories. However, unlike Ys, Nasir's color palette and equipped shield change to reflect the equipment status screen icon. Also borrowed from Ys is the five rings. Players can discover the Protective, Power, Defensive, Curing, and Time ring, all of which mirror the abilities found in Ys. The Protective Ring increases defensive power, the Power Ring increases offensive power, the Defensive Ring makes Nasir invincible to lesser enemies, the Curing Ring gradually heals Nasir, and the Time Ring stops the movement of weak enemies. During Nasir's adventure, he will also discover a plethora of other permanent and consumable items that will aid him in his quest. Of note, is that the status and equipment screen can not be accessed during boss fights, so players must prepare for battle beforehand.Lagoon's magic system uses a mix and match system to give players a total of 16 magical attacks. Broken down into Fire, Wind, Water, and Thunder categories, players must find both a crystal and staff to make use of magical attacks. Scattered throughout the game is the Earth, Sky, Star, and Moons Staff, and the Fire, Wind, Water, and Thunder crystal. By mixing up which crystal and staff Nasir has equipped, different attacks with different properties can be activated. This important, as certain enemies are either immune or weak to certain elements.Much like any other RPG, Lagoon utilizes a health, magic, gold, and experience point system. Defeated enemies automatically give players a set amount of gold and experience, and once a certain experience threshold is met, Nasir will level-up, gaining additional stats. Of note is the game's health and magic system, that regenerate, in any environment, as long as Nasir is standing still.Exploration in Lagoon is done much the same as in any other top-down platformer. Players must navigate a multitude of environments, each with their own set of obstacles and dangers. Players must also be careful of pitfalls, or bottomless pits, as they will instantly kill Nasir if he falls into one. However, this is offset by the game's save system, which allows players to save anywhere outside of a boss fight.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]This is the list of major characters in Lagoon, taken directly from the manual:Nasir - Born to be the Champion of Light, the protagonist has become a skilled swordsman under the tutelage of the wise Mathias. He displays intelligence and courage beyond his years.Mathias - Skilled in the art of the sword and in the ways of magic, he raised Nasir from infancy.Thor - Aligned with the forces of Darkness, he is known as a skilled swordsman and for the fact that each of his eyes is a different color.Zerah - an evil warlock, he is aligned with the forces of Darkness. He stole the child of Darkness from Mathias and raised him. He seeks to resurrect the evil spirit and bring the forces of Darkness to rule the land.Felicia - Queen of Lagoon castle, she is the only one who has the power to open the door to the Secret Place and to move the Lagoon Castle.Duma and Battler - Henchmen of Zerah.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Laplace no Ma</title_clean>
				<plot>The town Newcam, Massachusetts, 1924. On the outskirts of the town stands the Weathertop mansion. It was just an ordinary place until the last owner, Benedict Weathertop, started practicing black magic. He killed his parents and populated the mansion with all kinds of undead. Since then, nobody dared to approach the mansion. But a short while ago, two boys were found dead near this horrible place. Apparently, the boys had tried to enter the mansion. Another evidence pointed out that a girl followed them - but her body hasn't been found yet, and there is a slight hope she might be alive. This is where you, the hero of the game, decide to investigate the mystery, and to venture into the mansion...Laplace no Ma (Devil of Laplace) is a Japanese-style RPG with horror elements, somewhat similar to Sweet Home for NES. Unlike Sweet Home, this game is more oriented towards RPG gameplay. You are not stuck in the mansion, but can leave it, visit the town, and buy supplies. Later you also visit other locations such as a castle, etc. The battles are random, turn-based, and are viewed from first-person perspective. The hero of the game can recruit three other characters to the party of five available. Each character (including the hero, to whom you assign gender and class) belongs to one of the five character classes: Dilettante, Medium, Detective, Scientist, or Journalist. Dilettante is an all-around character with defensive magic, Medium is a kind of a black mage, Detective is a melee fighter, Scientist can construct powerful machines to perform various techniques, and the Journalist can take pictures of the monsters, which is the only way to gain money in the game.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Leading Company is a corporate strategy simulation game from Koei, and part of their library of modern business "Executive" strategy games that also includes Aerobiz and Winning Post. It's based around 1970s and 1980s corporate culture, with the player assuming control of a corporation that researches and produces VCR and VHS electronics. The player's given a plot of land with which to expand their operation, and must balance income and growth.The game was never released outside of Japan and is very text-heavy, making Japanese fluency a necessity in order to play it. It was originally released on the NEC PC-9801 and Sharp X68000 home computers and eventually ported to the Super Famicom. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The first level - 'Just Dig'.Originally an Amiga exclusive, developed by DMA design (later becoming Rockstar North) was met with an exceptional reception and was quickly ported to many different platforms. A puzzle game that requires players to direct a group of green haired, blue-shirted, lemmings from point A to point B. The game is based on the myth that lemmings migrate in large groups and follow a single leader, who would often lead them off a cliff to their demise. In the game, lemmings constantly march in one direction unless they run into an obstacle, at which point they turn around and walk the other way. Being fearless and unaware of their own mortality, the lemmings will blindly run into fire, jump off cliffs, become crushed and fall victim to numerous other pitfalls.The player must command the lemmings to do certain tasks in order to complete each stage and get a certain percentage of lemmings to safety. These actions include digging, using a pick axe to dig diagonally, using their arms (windmill style) to punch horizontally through terrain and building staircases to traverse large gaps.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]All levels in Lemmings consist of at least one entrance, and at least one exit. The aim in each level is to safely get an allocated amount of lemmings towards an exit. Obstacles; such as water, deadly traps and great heights will hinder the lemmings' progress.There are 120 levels in total, split into four difficulty ratings - Fun, Tricky, Taxing, and Mayhem.[CR][B]Skills:[/B][CR]There are eight different skills available for the lemmings to carry out. Each level has a different selection and amount of abilities available. Different situations require the use of different skills.Several lemmings using the 'floater' skill.The skills are:Climbers - Climbers will climb a vertical surface until they reach the end of the surface.Diggers - Diggers will dig downward vertically through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Miners - These will dig diagonally downward through any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Bashers - Will dig horizontally through a wall made of any soft surface until they reach empty space impenetrable surface.Builders - Will build a 12 step stairway diagonally upwards.Blockers - Will stop walking and block the advances of other lemmings, causing them to reverse their course.Bombers - A countdown will appear above their head, counting from 5 to 0. Upon reaching zero, they will explode.Floaters - Using an umbrella, these lemmings will float down a long drop.Lemmings being nuked.Three other types of commands can be used by the player, these are:Drop rate - The player may increase and decrease the rate in which lemmings fall from the entrance.Pause - The player may temporarily halt the game, this mode can be used to select skills without using any extra time on the clock.Nuke - If the player has reached a dead end and cannot finish the level then this button can be clicked in order to blow up every lemming on the screen.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Libble Rabble</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Libble Rabble is a 1983 Namco Arcade game, created by the same Namco developer (Tohru Iwatani) that created Pac-Man and Pole Position. It features the characters of Libble and Rabble as they attempt to harvest Mushlins for dinner.The gameplay resembles the once-popular board game where players wrap rubber bands around pegs lined up on a board. The player, as the red (Libble) and blue (Rabble) arrows, must maneuver their attaching string around the pegs on the board and touch in order to create a closed loop. Anything within the loop is either collected (Mushlins, and other bonuses) or temporarily thwarted (Hoodlins, other enemies). Once all the Mushlins on the board are collected, the player moves onto the next stage. If nothing is collected inside a loop, it may spawn an additional enemy on the board.The game was eventually converted to the Sharp X68000, FM Towns and Super Famicom in 1993/94. While keeping most of the basic in-game art of the original Arcade game, it also featured 16-bit cutscenes that described the story.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Life and Death</title_clean>
				<plot>Life &amp; Death is a game which casts you as a doctor in a hospital. Your job is to diagnose patients and administer appropriate therapies, or even perform surgery when necessary. To diagnose a patient, you have to press on his or her abdomen, to see which portions of the stomach cause pain. Basing on this knowledge, you can choose a therapy for him (observation, medication or referring to another specialist) or administer a X-Ray or ultrasound scan to get more information about his illness. In some cases, surgery will be necessary. You're the surgeon and you have to perform the operation very carefully, adhering strictly to the procedures, preserving hygiene, and maintaining care when cutting up the patient. Should you mistakenly administer the wrong therapy, or kill your patient at the operating table, you're kicked into the medical school, where you're given hints as to what you've done wrong. </plot>

				<plot>Lightning Vaccus is a futuristic turn-based war strategy game. The plot is advanced through cutscenes and involves a struggle for dominance between two fictional countries, each in possession of powerful mecha units called "AD". The first scenario follows a battle on the Vaccus peninsula; subsequent scenarios can be chosen by the player. The story also reflects the experiences of an officer who has lost his teammates and longs to end the war and return home.The battles take place on a grid with hexagonal fields. Before each battle the player selects a number of units, ranging from simple AD to tanks, mobile rocket launchers, etc. Then the player positions the units tactically on the map. When two units belonging to opposing sides meet on adjacent hex fields, an automatic battle ensues, which is displayed on a separate screen.</plot>

				<plot>In Lipstick Adventure, the player takes the role of Gorou, a young Japanese private detective. One day, a wealthy and powerful old man contacts him and asks him to find a box which - according to him - contained a family treasure. The young detective thinks that fortune has finally smiled to him, but when his pretty girlfriend Otomi disappears, he realizes that the mystery is bigger than he thought...The game is a traditional Japanese adventure, with the usual first-person view and "Look - Talk - Think - Move" interface. There are no puzzles, and the game usually advances the plot when all the commands at a given screen are depleted, sometimes requiring to visit different locations several times.</plot>

				<title_clean>Lipstick Adventure 3</title_clean>
				<plot>This entry in the  Lipstick Adventure series continues the story of the young private detective Gorou and his sweetheart Otomi. After attending a friend's marriage ceremony, they return to Gorou's office and find a strange package in the flowers. The package contains pictures of Otomi and several other girls, her schoolmates, some of them naked. Gorou heads to Otomi's high school to begin the investigation, without realizing that he will soon become involved in a sinister conspiracy...Lipstick Adventure 3 plays similarly to its predecessors, having typical Japanese adventure gameplay with menu-based verb commands. The interface has been slightly tweaked, allowing easier "triggering" of events by eliminating some unnecessary commands.Like the previous games in the series, Lipstick Adventure 3 walks a fine line between adult and non-adult games, having graphical nudity and plenty of sexual innuendo, but no explicit sex scenes.</plot>

				<title_clean>Lipstick Adventure II</title_clean>
				<plot>This is the second entry in  Lipstick Adventure series. Once again, the protagonist is the young private detective Gorou. One day his girlfriend Otomi introduces to him a customer, a man who calls himself Sakamoto. When Gorou meets him at the train station, Sakamoto hands him a suitcase, saying he should deliver it to his company in Osaka. However, the suitcase contains a bomb, and the poor Gorou is brought to police headquarters as a terrorist suspect...Like the first game, Lipstick Adventure 2 is a detective/mystery Japanese-style adventure with comical and erotic elements. The player typically advances in the game by going through all the menu commands at a given screen. The commands are of a traditional "Look - Talk - Think - Move" variety, with sub-menus for object names.</plot>

				<title_clean>Record of Lodoss War - Haiiro no Majo</title_clean>
				<plot>Haiiro no Majo is one of the several different games set in the fictional Lodoss War universe created by Ryo Mizuno. The game's introductory plot loosely follows the events of the first novel, The Grey Witch, centering on the enigmatic character Karla and her influence on the world's politics. Several popular characters from the cycle (such as the dwarf Ghim whom the player can recruit early in the game) make an appearance as well.Despite its Japanese origins and anime-style visual aesthetics, this incarnation of the series is a Western-style role-playing game in the tradition of Wizardry and Ultima games. Rather than following a linear story focused on a lead character, the player creates a party of characters and takes them on a journey through the world of Lodoss. A few NPCs can join the party as well. Character races include Humans, Elves, Dwarves, and Halflings, while the classes comprise Warriors, Shamans, Priests, Scouts, and Knights. The player can manually distribute five bonus points among the character's six attributes: Strength, Intelligence, Agility, Endurance, Luck, and Personal Beauty.After the party has been created the heroes find themselves in the starting town. All the towns have identical or similar location visuals (inns, temples, markets, etc.), and can only be navigated by selecting locations from a menu. Overworld navigation and battles are viewed from a top-down perspective; dungeons are done in pseudo-3D first-person view and require illuminated torches for exploration. Battles occur either randomly or are triggered whenever the party enters a specific location. The player can opt to set combat on auto, the result calculated according to the participants' parameters. Manual fighting involves navigating characters on the battle field in round-based fashion, selecting physical attacks or magical spells when enemies are in their range. </plot>

				<title_clean>Loop Eraser</title_clean>
				<plot>Loop Eraser is a puzzle game consisting of 120 stages. Each stage is a screen containing puzzle pieces arranged in different patterns on a screen. Each piece has a line drawn on it, and can be rotated left and right to change its direction. A line that faces downward but is not connected to another one will automatically fall down until it becomes adjacent to another line. The goal is to connect lines together under correct angles to build "loops", i.e. complete forms out of straight lines that encircle an area of the screen. A loop disappears once formed. A stage is solved when all the lines have been arranged into loops and are therefore removed completely from the screen.</plot>

				<title_clean>Loopz</title_clean>
				<plot>A puzzle game where the main goal is to make loops! Random pieces are presented over a board, including simple lines and corners as well as S bends and other warped shapes, of varying sizes. It is up to the player to link them up in a loop form, then moving on to the next level. Pieces can be placed on any empty space on the grid, and rotated into one of the four main compass directions.Any pieces which are not part of the finished loop when a level is completed are left on the screen, so there is value in playing towards 2 distinct loops, to ensure that you have options depending on which pieces are drawn - unlike Pipe Dream there are no clues as to which pieces are coming next.Three play modes are available, two of which can be played with two players. Game A is freestyle - simply make loops, gaining extra points for size and style. Game B is about unlocking bonus boards of the game by reaching a certain score and uses a bonus multiplier method depending on loop difficulty.The third mode of play begins with an already made loop and then removes random pieces of it, so the player has to put them back in when they appear again. It is essentially a memory test and logic puzzle of fitting the pieces back as one remembers - although placing a piece where it seems to fit is also often effective.</plot>

				<plot>Mad Stalker is a side-scrolling mecha-themed brawler in which the player controls a character piloting a giant mecha (called "Slave Gear" in the game), fighting hostile robots unleashed upon the city by an evil mastermind. The player can choose between three playable characters: Chico Rodrigues, Richard Winston, and Eve Lurdia, each piloting their own version of a Slave Gear, distinguished by visual appearance as well as balancing of strength and speed. The game consists of six linear stages in which the protagonist has to eliminate all enemies on screen before advancing, typically facing a boss enemy at the end of a stage. All the enemies in the game are mechas. Player-controlled robots fight with fists or swords (Winston's mecha); they can also jump, kick, as well as grab and throw opponents. The game also includes a single- or two-player versus fighting mode in which players can choose to control the protagonists or enemy mechas.</plot>

				<plot>Mahjong Clinic: Z&#333;kang&#333; is a mahjong game with a story. The player character visits his little sister in a hospital, and ends up challenging nurses, patients, and other people to mahjong matches. The player can choose locations from a map (hospital rooms, reception area, etc.), which leads to a short scene and a mahjong game. These encounters can be tackled in a different order, but have to be completed in order to open new areas. If the player is victorious in a mahjong match an erotic scene may ensue.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Mahou Daisakusen is a fairly standard arcade-style shoot-'em-up game for the time in which it was released. Featuring fast bullets, simple gameplay, and an interesting setting, it provides a straightforward and enjoyable shooter experience. All four playable characters went on to become mainstays in Raizing shooters, making an appearance in future Mahou Daisakusen titles, as well as crossing over into other titles such as Battle Garegga and Armed Police Batrider.The game was released in some territories outside of Japan as "Sorcer Striker."[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The game is set in a fantasy world filled with magic and magic-fueled machinery. A peaceful kingdom is under assault by the encroaching Gobligan Empire, led by a mysterious human leader known only as the Gobligan King. As the kingdom finds itself unable to drive off the Gobligan Empire's advances, King Codwenna announces a huge bounty for the Gobligan King's head. Four heroes answer the call, and set out to defeat the Gobligan King and restore peace to the kingdom.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Gain, the WarriorA master of swords and physical combat, Gain wanders the land with his pet monkey Shain in search of the ultimate weapon. Attracted by the large bounty offered for the Gobligan King, Gain takes up arms in his ship, the Valhallyzer, against the Gobligan Empire. His signature weapon is the Buster Sword.Chitta, the MagicianDespite her appearance as a youthful girl, Chitta is a formidable magic user and the granddaughter of a legendary hero. Bored of the quiet life of her village, she sneaks away in her grandfather's magical ship, the Gun Dalf, to seek adventure. Her signature attacks are the Thunder Beam and Ice Cube.Miyamoto, the Samurai DragonWell-mannered and wise, Miyamoto the samurai dragon seeks revenge against Tsumujimaru, one of his former disciples. Tsumujimaru turned his back on Miyamoto's teachings and murdered Miyamoto's own Master, then fled into the Gobligan Empire. Miyamoto does not use a magical ship, but rather flies with his own two wings, and attacks via shuriken, ninjutsu stones, and other secret techniques.Bornnam, the NecromancerDetested and shunned by society, Bornnam lives in seclusion, practicing the black arts of necromancy and gleefully collecting bones. He decides to fight against the Gobligan Empire as a chance to test his power. Via the power of the divine dragon skull that rests on his head, he is able to transform into the Golgodian, a "ship" form that enables him to fly in the air and absorb the ambient mana from the sky in order to cast his spells. His favorite attacks are the Skull Napalm and Search Ghost.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Mai</title_clean>
				<plot>Mai is a little girl with cat ears who studies the art of magic. Unfortunately, she doesn't always do her homework, and sometimes loses control of her magical powers. This is precisely what happened one day, when she accidentally unleashed a magical spell upon terrified classmates. Now the poor girl is being hunted down by male and female students, teachers, and other people, and she has to fight for her life while perfecting her magic-casting skills.Mai is similar to the better-known Mad&#333; Monogatari games in many ways: it is a solo pseudo-3D first-person dungeon crawl; it casts a little innocent girl with magical powers as the heroine; it displays no numeric statistics (damage feedback, the heroine's progress, etc. are shown only graphically or with the help of text messages); it has an overall "cute" theme with comical animations. However, unlike Mad&#333; Monogatari, Mai contains graphical nudity and scenes with mild depiction of sexual situations.</plot>

				<title_clean>Maison Ikkoku Kanketsu Hen Special</title_clean>
				<plot>The game is based on the manga Maison Ikkoku by Rumiko Takahashi.Set in Tokyo of the 80-ies, the story can be described as a romantic tale with a touch of comedy. It centers on a boarding house which is managed by the young and lovely widow Kyoko Otonashi. The protagonist is a college student named Yusaki Godai, and his relationship with Kyoko is the main plot line. The game's story approximately corresponds to the middle volumes of the manga until the conclusion.The game is a "puzzle-less" adventure, the gameplay mostly focusing on simply depleting all the verb commands at every given screen and moving between locations. The commands include the usual "Look", "Talk", and Move" typical for Japanese adventures (no "Think" command), but also context-sensitive commands "Eat", "Drink", etc., as well as the possibility to use certain inventory items.</plot>

				<title_clean>Marble Madness</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Originally released as a trackball arcade game from Atari Games, Marble Madness was created, designed and programmed by developer Mark Cerny. The object is to guide a marble through a maze, avoiding obstacles along the way. Marble Madness' well-known soundtrack was featured in this first arcade cabinet to include stereo sound. It was the first game to be released on Atari's System 1 hardware, which allow arcade owners to convert a machine into another game with the changing of just a few different parts. The success of the game has led it to being ported to many systems such as the NES, Master System and the Commodore 64. Marble Madness, along with Archon and Deluxe Paint, were some of the first "killer apps" for the Amiga, and greatly contributed to the system's initial appeal and sales.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Marble Madness is played from an isometric third-person perspective. The object of the game is to maneuver a colored marble through several different courses in the constraints of a time limit. Each ends when the marble reaches an end goal (marked "GOAL"). The player's marble carries momentum and a rudimentary physics model provides most of the challenge, as it is easy to fall off the side of the narrow courses.Finishing a course adds the remaining time to the limit placed on the next course. In the original arcade release, the player used a trackball to control the movement of the marble. Later home versions changed the controls to a directional pad or other control mechanism. The Amiga release is compatible with the Amiga Trackball.The marble is destroyed by falling off the course or by simply dropping too far onto another platform. In the event that the marble is shattered in a fall, a cartoon broom will appear and sweep the broken pieces away before respawning nearby. While there was no "lives remaining" counter, each fall or death wastes valuable time. Courses were designed in a manner that makes it extremely difficult to finish within the time limit if the player looses more than one or two marbles.As gameplay progresses, enemies and obstacles are introduced, raising difficulty. Challenges include moving platforms, catapults, a black "enemy" marble that would attempt to ram the player off the course, and even a course that must be run uphill instead of downhill. An option is also included which allows two players to race each other down any of the courses at the same time.Races:Practice Race: The first course, shorter than the others.Beginner Race: Longer, but relatively less complicated than the later courses.Intermediate Race: Featuring moving green hills and moving pools of acid that will swallow the marble.Aeriel Race: Featuring narrower platforms.Silly Race: This is the course which must be run uphill instead of downhill. Here, the player may "squash" formerly lethal enemies in one section. Ultimate Race: Featuring many of the obstacles from earlier in the game, making it the most difficult race of all.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B] &amp; Gameplay[CR]In M&#228;rchen Maze ("M&#228;rchen" is German for "fairytale"), the player takes control of a little girl named Alice who has been pulled in to a magical world by a white rabbit. It was originally released to the Arcade before being ported to the PC Engine and Sharp X68000. It would also be added to the Japanese Wii's Virtual Console in 2009.The Arcade and Sharp X68000 versions use an isometric view while the PC Engine uses a standard overhead view. The game's platforms are all suspended over a bottomless void. Alice can shoot bubbles, technically termed "shabon balls", at the enemy in an effort to knock them off of the floating terrain or destroy them. Holding down the attack button will charge the bubble and make it larger, resulting in greater knockback strength or simply more damage, depending on the enemy.The enemies are also trying to knock Alice off, too. In fact, Alice does not take damage in a conventional sense: the only way to lose a life is to fall in to the void. Alice comes equipped with several balloons which can rescue her from a fall should one occur. Alice is capable of jumping to avoid obstacles or shots from enemies, or to jump over gaps in the terrain. At the end of each stage is a boss; Alice has a 180 second time limit to get to the end and defeat the boss or else "time over" monsters will appear and attack her. The PC Engine version of the game lacks a time limit.ItemsA mystery package! There are several items which can be found in packages throughout the game. It is possible for power-ups to overlap.Balloon: Grants Alice an extra balloon, allowing her to fall off the terrain an additional time. An "extra life", in essence.Rabbit Barrier: Temporarily surrounds Alice with a barrier of rabbits, rendering her invulnerable. She can still fall off, though.Daikaiten: Makes Alice spin and shoot bubbles in all directions. This item is not in the Arcade version.Red Crystal: Worth 500 bonus points.Blue Crystal: Makes Alice's bubbles max size without charging for a period of time.Yellow Crystal: Temporarily freezes enemies in their tracks.Green Crystal: Temporarily gives Alice a three-way bubble shot.Purple Crystal: Temporarily increases Alice's movement speed.Clock: Adds more time to the timer. This item is not found in the PC Engine version.Jump Shoes: These allow Alice to Jump further for a period of time.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]One bad mushroom. Alice loves fantasy stories. One night she was suddenly awakened by a voice from her mirror; it was a white rabbit with a watch! He needs Alice's help to rescue the world of mirrors from the Dark Queen who has conquered it. Drawn in to the mirror, she is given a magic bubble-blowing straw and must free the 9 kingdoms of the mirror world from the Queen's clutches! [CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]Alice: The little girl who is the star of the game. She loves fantasy stories and wishes she was a princess. She's a bit of a crybaby.  White Rabbit: The protector of the mirror world, he calls Alice to come and rescue it. He appears periodically to update the player on how much time the character has left.  Queen of Darkness: The game's final boss, she is currently in control of the mirror world.  [CR]Arcade Version Stages[CR] The Sweets Kingdom. Stage 1: Okashi no Kuni, AKA the Sweets Kingdom. Obviously, a world of sweets! Cakes and tortes are visible below the path Alice must walk on, which resembles a wafer. The stage boss is a witch named Miyahja.Stage 2: Omocha no Kuni, the Toy Kingdom. It floats above Dali-esque clocks and a giant backgammon board. The boss is a giant wind-up dodo bird disturbingly named "Dead Rooster".Stage 3: Tsumiki no Kuni, the Building-Blocks Kingdom. It floats above a hedge-maze filled with blocks. The boss is a baby's stacking Daruma toy named Tumbler.Stage 4: Kikai no Kuni, the machine kingdom. Beneath the floating platforms lies a mass of pipes. The boss is a toy robot named Armeikon.Stage 5: Sora no Kuni, the Sky kingdom. For some reason most of the platforms here are in the shape of crosses; they float above (obviously) a skyscape. The boss is a helmet-wearing toy swordfish named Raydoc.Stage 6: Bikkuri no Kuni, the Kingdom of Surprises. It uses a re-colored tileset from the Sweets Kingdom. The boss is a giant toy tortoise creatively named Big Tortoise. For whatever reason, he has a huge nose, and wears shades and a nice hat.Arateeze.  Stage 7: Mushi no Kuni, the Bug Kingdom. Unsurprisingly, it is full of bugs. It re-uses the tile set from the Toy Kingdom, albeit recolored. The boss is some kind of flower/sun thing named Arateeze. At this point, the stages are relatively long!Stage 8: Heitai no Kuni, the Soldier's Kingdom. It re-uses the tileset from the Building-Blocks Kingdom, of course recolored. This stage is full of playing-card soldiers. The boss is a series of giant disembodied heads of the queen, called "Triple Heads".Stage 9: Jyoou no Kuni, the Queen's Kingdom. It re-uses the tile-set from the Sky Kingdom, although recolored in a menacing way. There are also floating chunks of rock added. The boss is, of course, the Queen of Darkness herself. Can Alice win? Play it and find out![CR]PC Engine Version Stages[CR]The PC Engine version has different stages than the Arcade game. Because of the lack of a time limit, many of the stages are much more expansive.Stage 1: The Sweets Kingdom, just like in the arcade version. The boss is still Miyahja the witch. Stage 2: The Machine Kingdom. Things start to vary from the arcade version! The boss is still Armeikon.Stage 3: Midorni no Kuni, the Green Kingdom. A kingdom full of plants and trees.... and slimes! The boss is Arateeze.Stage 4: Koori no Kuni, the Ice Kingdom. Where there is ice, there are penguins! The boss is Tumbler.Stage 5: Jikan no Kuni, the Time Kingdom. A strange world of clocks and bubbles. The boss is Triple Heads.Stage 6: Mizu no Kuni, the Water Kingdom. Alice has to maneuver on floating floating along a turbulent body of water here. Fortunately there are stationary metal platforms for more solid footing. The boss is Raydoc.Stage 7: Sora no Kuni, the Sky Kingdom. Another area that is also in the arcade game. Tons of mad hatters hang around here. The boss is Dead Rooster.The Mirror Kingdom.  Stage 8: Kagami no Kuni, the Mirror Kingdom. Considering it's a mirror world, this place is no surprise. It is, of course, a world of mirrors, populated by evil Alices. The boss is (rather bizarrely) Big Tortoise.Stage 9: Jyoou no Kuni, the Queen's Kingdom. In the PC Engine version, the Queen's Kingdom is a gloomy world of lava and playing card soldiers. The boss is, of course, the Queen.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Marine Buster</title_clean>
				<plot>Marine Buster is a turn-based strategy game that builds upon the rules of the popular board game BattleShip. The basic principle is the same as in BattleShip: players position ships on a board and then take turns attacking enemy ships by guessing their location on the opponent's board. The game offers several types of ships as well as weapon variants with limited amounts of ammo and different damage properties. Erotic pictures serve as a reward for successfully defeating the opponent.</plot>

				<title_clean>Martial Age</title_clean>
				<plot>Masahito is a Japanese teenager who studies martial arts. However, instead of studying, he prefers to chase pretty girls. Finally, after a quarrel with his father, Masahito leaves his home. Accidentally, he bumps into Keiko Yashima, the principal of Yuai girls school. She tests Masahito in combat, and against all rules, accepts him as the only male student in the school. Naturally, our hero uses this opportunity to "get lucky" with his all-female school mates...Martial Age is a Japanese-style adventure game. Most of the time here is spent depleting menu commands ("Look", "Talk", "Think", etc.) in every given location, exploring the school and getting acquainted with the girls. There is also turn-based combat in the game, but no statistics of any kind. The battles work like mini-games, which require the player to guess the "weak spots" of the girls, after which they give up and the hero can initiate a sexual scene.</plot>

				<plot>First you choose one out of four different characters to represent you, Scarlet (red army), Oberon (yellow army), Caesar (green army), or Madcap (blue army). The game is split into 10 levels - the first 9 are groups of 3 territories which can be completed in any order, while the final 'Mother of All Battles' has its own surprises. Land is mostly of sand, grass or ice. You start with 100 men and you can use whatever quantity you find necessary on each island. The rest men left will go to another level with another new 100. In the second half of the game you can freeze men to save them for the Mother of All Battles. Once you select your island and place for your HQ, you must do some research for better weapons and defences. On the roof of your buildings you can put protectors like archers, gunmen, boiling oil men, and later on even laser turrets. If you send a team of unarmed men into an unoccupied square, they will build an additional base there, with larger armies completing this more quickly.Later on higher levels, you'll also build mines and factories, as you'll need to dig a certain material for higher level weapons, depending on whether the area you're on is rich with a certain material or not. With each next level, you'll start from a higher technology level and be able to progress to one higher level up than at the previous level.If there is more then just one enemy, you can make an alliance until you crush the other one - three of you can form an alliance against fourth enemy. For what its worth, a certain numeric level of defence is always stronger from the same level of attacker, and men that are not armed (conscripts) can only kill enemy soldiers, not destroy or attack enemy fort.The main thing as always in strategy games is to be the sole survivor and lead your men to victory, experimenting on vicious technologies, equipping your men, making perfect soldiers out of them, produce shields, weapons, planes... to dominate the world and crush your opponents. You can do the battling only in a certain quadrant, but don't be long as your men will automatically start building the fort, and it will be at the bottom of age level and you'll need to invent everything for that one again.</plot>

				<title_clean>Mercury - The Prime Master</title_clean>
				<plot>When evolution reached its highest stage, the human species have emerged. Eventually, the humans became divided into three races: Fantura, Apocrypha, and Ende. The first two were proficient in all things magical, while the Ende civilization was technically the most advanced one, holding the secrets to robot construction and building beautiful cities in the skies. For many years, the three civilizations co-existed in peace. But an internal revolution in the Fantura countries led to a change of regime. The new leaders of Fantura invaded Ende, trying to get hold of their technological secrets. A young man named Chrom, who grew up in one of Ende's celestial cities, discovers that his mother belongs to the Apocrypha race. His mixed heritage and mysterious past are the key to the world's salvation.Despite its isometric perspective and the lack of anime-style touch in its graphics, Mercury: The Prime Master is a traditional Japanese RPG with all the typical ingredients: the party of heroes roam the world map, visiting cities to buy equipment, descending into dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based style. Characters with magical civilization background have access to magical spells, and Chrom is also able to activate a robot to help the heroes in battles.</plot>

				<title_clean>Metal Eye</title_clean>
				<plot>In Metal Eye, the player takes the role of a young weapons expert named Findhill. His father was apparently involved in a project that dealt with creating artificial life forms. But recently he has disappeared without a trace. Findhill remained alone, in a small town surrounded by vicious monsters. He wants to become a hunter, just like his father once was, to get rid of the monsters roaming the wilderness, and get to the bottom of his father's disappearance and his mysterious project.The game is a rather traditional Japanese RPG: Findhill and his companions, who join the party as dictated by the course of the story, wander around a vast world map, visiting towns, descending into dungeons, and fighting random enemies in turn-based combat viewed from a first-person perspective. The party can carry different types of weapons, including various guns (rifles, shotguns, etc.) with expendable bullets. Weapons and armor are shared by all the characters and need not be equipped on individual combatants. The player can also purchase robotic fighters (called "Metals" in the game) in shops, who would then join the party and participate in battles, controlled by the AI. There are scenes with nudity and sexual situations in the game.</plot>

				<title_clean>Mirage</title_clean>
				<plot>It happened long time ago, when mankind possessed the secrets of magic. One time, when a comet was approaching the Earth, a young woman gave birth to a baby. He was taken into the nearby village and grew up there. But he knew he was different from other children: he could not use magic, and on his hand there was a little star. He believed that he was cursed, and so did many people in his village. He learns that the ominous cave in the Northern Mountain might hold the answers to his questions. He embarks on this journey, determined to find out the identity of his father and his true role in the world.Mirage is essentially a dungeon crawler: the biggest portion of the game is spent navigating pseudo-3D maze-like dungeons (auto-mapped), fighting random enemies in turn-based combat. The hero is accompanied by another character, and both participate in combat. With time the hero and his companion learn magical spells. Dungeons also contain areas where weapons and items can be purchased.The game contains scenes with nudity and erotic images (though nothing "hardcore"). Many of the random enemies are pretty female demons, who disrobe when defeated.</plot>

				<title_clean>Momotarou Densetsu</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]An RPG based on the Momotarou legend (in fact, the game's name means "Momotarou Legend" or "Peach Boy Legend"), Hudson produced it around the same time as the similarly named and themed Momotarou Dentetsu series, which involves railroads and is more board game-like in nature.Like many early JRPGs, the game plays similarly to Enix's Dragon Quest. The battles are turn-based and the player must explore the world's dungeons for valuable quest items while interacting with NPCs in towns to receive hints on what to do as well as purchase and sell items and equipment. Momotaro is eventually joined by his three animal companions, which were also part of his legend, though they don't act as separate party members in battle.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Moonlight-chan Rinshan is an erotic quiz game. The player may select any of the eight available female opponents. He is then taken to a customization screen where he is prompted to assign points into quiz categories (history, geography, sports, anime, games, etc.) and types of clothes. The latter determine the intervals at which questions of a specific categories will be asked, and establish the minimum number of correct answers the player is obliged to give before losing the game. It is possible to balance the categories or invest half of the points into one which the player assumes to be particularly familiar with. Girls remove an article of their clothes after each successfully won round.</plot>

				<plot>In this game, you control a bumper car, and the object is to bump your opponents off the gameboard while they do the same to you, and once you have managed to bump all your opponents off the board, you move on to the next round. If you take too long to complete a round, a fireball will strike one of the tiles on the board, causing them to collapse and making it more likely that you or your opponents are killed. In some rounds, you can get power-ups that give you extra bumping powers and the ability to jump over gaps. When you jump, you can break a tile to the point where it collapses, making it easier for opponents to fall down the gap that will be left there.</plot>

				<plot>Rogles, the tyrant who wanted to gain control over the three worlds in the universe, was defeated by Yuko, an ordinary Japanese teenager who was chosen to become the heroic Valis Soldier.  The dream world Vecanti fell into the hands of Emperor Megas. Driven by intense hatred to Rogles and his followers, Megas became an even more dangerous fanatic, imposing an iron rule on his realm. Yuko must now travel to the dream world and defeat the new tyrant and his minions.Like its predecessor, Mugen Senshi Valis II is an action platformer. Yuko fights and jumps her way through enemies and platform structures, acquiring various power-ups during the course of the game. Various weapons and armor can be found in the stages and equipped on a separate screen. Weapons have their own unique ranged patterns and are always attached to Yuko's default sword attack. Different types of armor may increase Yuko's hit points, offense, and defense ratings. Yuko can also acquire and execute special attacks and techniques, such as for example an ability that freezes all the enemies on screen for a limited amount of time. These deplete a separate bar that can be filled by collecting colored orbs left by enemies. Two of the six stages control like side-scrolling shoot-em-ups, allowing Yuko to fly in any direction.The Sharp X68000 version features improved graphics, voice acting during the intro, reduced difficulty level (particularly for boss battles), and allows the player to save the game between the stages.</plot>

Recently she has made groundbreaking discoveries with one of the test subjects, a whale named Gigi. Ryouko managed to establish full communication with the animal and teach him information. However, other people involved in the project have their own ideas concerning the practical usage of the whale's intelligence, and are ready to use it to further their own shady agendas.My Eyes! plays similarly to visual novels, albeit with many more choices and interaction than it is usually the case with games of its type. There are no permanent menus and only a few instances where navigation is possible; however, the player is often presented with several context-specific commands and choices in each situation.

				<plot>In 21th century the Earth became overpopulated, and humans began building colonies in the solar system. Technological expansion led to widespread pollution; in order to counter it, a powerful computer Naious was built. One century later, humans became completely dependent on Naious, and that was when it stroke unexpectedly. European cities were reduced to ruins after a single attack. The fighter spacecraft ASP and its pilot Manami Katagiri were dealing with a possible rebellion on Jupiter when it became clear that the future fate of humanity depends on them.Naious is a horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up. The gameplay is fairly traditional and involves navigating outdoor and indoor stages (often with narrow spaces), destroying mobile and stationary enemies on the way. The fighter craft starts with a vulcan gun and can later change to wide shot, laser, and homing missiles. Rather infrequent power-ups appear at set points on the stages and change or enhance the plane's weapons.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Dodge Ball was released for the Arcade and later adapted to the NES. It was originally released in Japan as Nekketsu K&#333;k&#333; Dodgeball Bu ("Hot-Blooded Highschool Dodgeball Club"), part of the Kunio-Kun series.The game saw some significant changes between its Arcade and NES versions. The Sharp X68000 is a port of the Arcade version, which was later also added to the Ore-tachi Game Center Zoku compilation for PS2. The NES version was later added to the Kunio-kun Nekketsu Collection 1 for GBA and the Wii's Virtual Console in 2007.[CR]NES Port[CR]The NES port of Super Dodge Ball consists of three modes: Super Dodge Ball mode, Vs. Mode, and Bean Ball Mode. In Super Dodge Ball Mode, one player takes on seven countries and their respective Dodge Ball teams on their way to Dodge Ball supremacy. Each team has their own strengths and weaknesses, as well as their own home court. The countries included in the single player, and Vs. mode, are: England, Iceland, Africa, Japan, China, India, Russia, and the USA.Additionally, if the player can make it through all of the teams, they will play "Team Shadow." Team Shadow is an evil version of team USA with similar teammates, power throws, and home court advantage.Vs. Mode was simple 2 player Super Dodge Ball Mode.In Bean Ball mode, players are taken back to their days on the playground. This is less structured, and allows players to run around all over the place. Play continues until there is only one player left standing.Currently, the only sequels that exist have yet to be released outside of Japan. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>Nintendo World Cup, originally released in 1990 was one of the best soccer games available on the Nintendo Entertainment System.  It was published by Nintendo and developed by    Technos Japan Corporation.  The soccer (football) in the game is six on six between many different countries including East Germany and West Germany.  You can play soccer on grass, sand, ice and dirt.  The game was designed by the same developers of   River City Ransom and such, the players have large heads and short legs.  In fact, many of the same sprites used in River City Ransom are used in World Cup.  The game also features some of the most addicting music ever on the NES. When it comes to slide tackles, there are no fouls.  It is encouraged to take out players via slide tackle to take the ball from them.  Also, if you tackle a player enough times, the player will get injured and will no longer be able to play.  Instead, the player would remain unconscious on the field until a goal was scored.  The tackle animations are quite pleasing.   Players are given five super shots per half and can be used by performing a header or a bicycle kick.  Each country had its own unique supershot.  What is unique about these shots is how crazy they were.  Some would look like they are going one direction then go another and some would go so fast you could barely see them.Also, every first game is against Cameroon for some reason.Nintendo World Cup's Multiplayer mode allows players to choose the type of field they would play on.  Available choices include sand, grass, dirt, and ice.  These alternative surfaces have a big effect on gameplay.  The dirt field has big rocks that could trip players, even so far as to injure them enough so the player would lie unconscious on the field.  The ice field makes players slide around, while the sand field slows the ball's movement considerably. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>Nemesis '90 Kai is an enhanced remake of Nemesis 2. The main difference lies in presentation, with higher-quality music and significantly more detailed graphics. The gameplay is mostly unchanged, with the exception of the possibility to equip four options on the player-controlled ship (as opposed to only two in the original version) and a few tweaks to secondary weapons and power-ups. Two new stages and four boss enemies have been added to this version. </plot>

				<plot>Neural Gear is a pseudo-3D scrolling shooter similar to Space Harrier. You play as Emi T. Fonon, a futuristic soldier from the years after World War IV, who wears a bio-powered suit that can fly back in time and destroy time travelling robots. Each level goes back to an earlier date and has more numerous and powerful enemies.The game is completely controlled with the mouse. Left clicking fires the main weapon - yellow energy balls, while right clicking fires a sub weapon, which is chosen at the start of the level. There are four sub weapons to choose from: SPC that shoots powerful blue energy balls, Rockets, Homing Missiles and the most powerful sub weapon in the game "???" which is actually a bomb that can instantly kill all enemies on screen, including bosses but it also take out around 500-600 health.An interesting feature of this game is the health system. The timer at the top of the screen also acts as the health bar and it decreases faster when you get hit. Enemies come in large groups, sometimes in formations, and shooting twenty enemies will refill your timer 200 points. Getting to the end of a level also adds a certain amount to the timer depending on the level.</plot>

				<title_clean>The New Zealand Story</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The New Zealand Story, sometimes stylized as The NewZealand Story and occasionally called Kiwi Kraze, is a 1988 Arcade action game from Taito that was ported to a number of platforms. The player controls the kiwi bird Tiki and must rescue his fellow kiwis, including his girlfriend Phee-Phee, from the villainous Willy Walrus. Kiwis can be found at the end of each stage, which the player must progress through with a mix of platforming, vehicle sequences and shooting enemies with bolts to remove them.The computer ports were published by UK company Ocean Software, which also published the NES game in Europe. The North American NES release was named Kiwi Kraze instead. It also saw a Japan-exclusive PC Engine port that would later be added to the Wii's Virtual Console (also Japan only). The Arcade version of The New Zealand Story was also added to the 2005 Taito Legends compilation.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The story of The New Zealand Story takes place in the Zoological Garden of New Zealand's North Island. The two kiwis Tiki and his girlfriend Phee-Phee live happily together with the rest of the colony, until one day Wally Walrus comes to town. Wally captures the defenseless kiwis and carries them off to cages hidden in zoos and parks all over New Zealand. Trapped, they can only await their fate of being eaten by the Walrus!Luckily, while Wally is busy thinking about kiwi meals, Tiki manages to escape from his cage and plans to save his girlfriend Phee-Phee and the rest of the colony. A race against time begins as Tiki battles with Wally's friends in the maze-like worlds of New Zealand's zoos, so that he can finally reach the evil Walrus and save his friends.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Lives, Continues and ScoringTiki starts the game with three lives. He can get a bonus life at 50,000 points and every additional 20,000 points after that. Tiki loses a life when he is hit or when he runs out of oxygen. The player does not have to start the level from the beginning, though. They can resume the game directly where Tiki died. At the beginning of the game the player does not have any continues, but after completing stage 2-4 and 4-5 they are awarded a continue.Each time Tiki destroys an enemy the player gains 150 points. Additionally, enemies drop bonuses after being defeated. The bonus items are worth 100 extra points and in some cases Tiki also gets a special power from them.Bonus items include:Fruit: These only give 100 extra pointsWeapons: Bow and Arrow, Bomb, Laser Gun, Plasma Ball.Joystick: This one is only useful for riding balloons. It allows the player to control the balloon in a more sophisticated way than they normally can. It allows Tiki to stay in mid-air (normally the only options are to go either up or down) and change the direction left, right, up and down.Book: The book immediately destroys all enemies on-screen.Potion: The potion grants Tiki temporal invincibility.Stopwatch: All enemies are immobilized for a limited amount of time.MovementTiki has four basic abilities: he can shoot his bow, walk, jump and swim.Jumping can be alternated in height by holding down the button longer or shorter.When swimming, Tiki only has a limited supply of oxygen. He can attack enemies from the water when coming up for air by squirting water at them.Tiki is furthermore able to fly with the help of balloons. Balloons can be found scattered around the levels or he can steal them from enemies. There are six different kinds of balloons in total. Each of them has different characteristics.[CR][B]Levels:[/B][CR]There are 21 levels in total. All the levels are set in real life locations in New Zealand.The game begins in Auckland, then passes through Rotorua, The Waitomo Caves, Wellington Strait, Cook Strait and Hammer Springs to the final confrontation with Wally at Mount Cook. In every level Tiki has to save one of his kiwi friends, until he finally reaches his girlfriend Phee-Phee. The enemies, however, are not the only problem: There is a time limit for every level. If the player is too slow the Time Dragon will descend.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Nobunaga no Yabou - Bushou Fuunroku</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The fourth of Koei's Sengoku era-set strategy games, Nobunaga's Ambition: The Lord of Darkness ("Nobunaga no Yabou: Bushou Fuuunroku", or "Nobunaga's Ambition: Record of Generals in Turbulent Times") is a war sim in which the player controls one of many daimyos (warlords) attempting to take over Japan. The game expands to cover all of Japan's territories, a feature introduced in the second game but dropped in the third, and introduces subordinate generals that assist the daimyo in battle and lend him their strength. The generals were originally introduced in Nobunaga's Ambition's sister series Romance of the Three Kingdoms.The game was released for the US SNES as Nobunaga's Ambition: Lord of Darkness. However, it is simply known as Nobunaga's Ambition on the Genesis and isn't to be confused with the original NES/SNES Nobunaga's Ambition (which is actually the second in the series, as the first never left Japan).[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Nobunaga no Yabou: Haouden ("Nobunaga's Ambition: Tale of the Conquerer") is a strategy-sim from Koei and the fifth in their flagship Nobunaga's Ambition series of Sengoku-era feudal sims. Once again, the player assumes one of a number of daimyos, including Oda Nobunaga himself, and tries to take over the rest of Japan. It was originally released in 1992 for the PC-9801 home computer and ported to various other computers and consoles of the period.Among the tweaks to the gameplay was the addition of castles, which are now the locations that players must conquer in order to take over new territory. Haouden was also the first game in the series to be given an expansion pack, though this pack would not be available to all versions of the game.The game was the first flagship Nobunaga's Ambition game to never receive a US localization. It sits between the fourth game, Nobunaga's Ambition: Lord of Darkness (Nobunaga no Yabou: Bushou Fuuunroku) from 1990, and the sixth game, Nobunaga no Yabou: Tenshouki from 1994. [CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Oh! Pai</title_clean>
				<plot>Oh! Pai is an adaptation of a tile game that has similarities to mahjong, though with much simpler rules. The player competes one-on-one against any of the six young women featured in the game. Each opponent offers a different thematic set of tiles (e.g. a stereotypical shy schoolgirl uses teddy bears, pink clothes, etc.), but the game rules are always the same: form simple combinations of three or more identical tiles to win. After each successful round the girl removed a part of her clothes.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Pac-Land was created by Namco and released into arcades in 1984. It was also ported to many consoles and in 1996 was included in Namco Museum Vol 4 for the PlayStation. The arcade game used the Namco Pac-Land system board, which was also used in Dragon Buster, Metro-Cross, Baraduke and Sky Kid. Pac-Land also featured parallax scrolling for some of its backgrounds, which was not commonplace until the 16-bit era.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game centers around getting a fairy to the end of the stage and eventually back to the Queen Fairy in Fairyland. Since there were the five ghosts (Pinky, Inky, Blinky, Clyde and Sue) that kept chasing Pac-Man, the fairy was tucked away safely under the hat that Pac-Man was wearing. Together they venture right and left, completing levels and avoiding dangerous obstacles like quicksand, water and the ghosts themselves.For bonus points, the player can collect cherries and other items. Also, there is an power pellet on each stage that Pac-Man can collect. That turns the ghosts blue. Then the ghost consuming can begin...When the player has made it to the end of the final stage, they are awarded with a pair of magical boots. Those are helpful, as they allow continuous jumps in the air as Pac-Man returns home. Once he is home, he is greeted by Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man. If playing the US release, Pac-Man is also greeted by Sourpuss and Chomp-Chomp (from the Pac-Man cartoon).Then, if the player chooses, Pac-Man starts another journey with the same objective but with increased difficulty.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Parodius Da!</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Parodius Da!, or simply Parodius, is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up from Konami that plays similarly to their Gradius series. Its full Japanese title is Parodius Da! Shinwa kara Owarai e, or "It's Parodius! From Myth to Laughter".Following the popularity of their own Gradius franchise, Konami took the basic concepts from those games, but added a healthy dose of weird to the characters, environments, and enemies. Parodius is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up at its heart. Players use their ships to blast wave after wave of enemies, collecting powerups that range from shields to missiles to, in the case of Parodius, heat-seaking octopuses.A lot of characters in the game come from various Konami franchises, as well as popular characters in Japanese culture and history. It is a very deliberate send-up of Gradius, with menu options including "One Player", "Two Player" and "Lollipop", but is a very accomplished version of the series at its heart which, despite the candy-coated visuals, zany characters and far out enemies, is a great game in its own right.This game is actually the second Parodius in the series: the first was exclusive to the Japanese home computer MSX and was named Parodius: Tako wa Chikyuu o Sukuu ("Parodius: The Octopus Saves the Earth").[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]While the only playable character in the Gradius series is the Vic Viper fighter, Parodius' selectable characters offer a bit more variety.TwinbeeTwinbeeA small blue plane with two big fists on the front, Twinbee is the eponymous main character in its own series of games, the second of which was ported to the US and renamed as Stinger. In its games, Twinbee's powerups were granted by shooting bells that appear on the screen. The bells also appear in Parodius, supplying the player with a limited set of power-ups that work independently from the standard weapon power-ups gained from blowing up enemy ships. Twinbee's power-ups include rocket fists, which fly across the screen and slowly return to the plane, a forwards and backwards shot, a three-way shot, shadowed out copies of Twinbee that fire and cannot be damaged, and a radial shield that offers a wide area of protection.Vic ViperVic ViperThe Vic Viper is just about the only normal thing about Parodius. Its power-ups match those found in Gradius. Included are missiles that travel along the ground and ceiling, a double-shot, a laser beam, small glowing options which absorb bullets and fire when the Vic Viper fires, and a shield which blocks shots in front.TakosukeTakosukeTakosuke is a space-faring, headband-wearing octopus. He was created specifically for this game, and in a weird way fits into the game better because of it. His power-ups include missiles that fire straight up and down, a forwards and backwards shot, a wide-area ripple laser, little octopuses that follow Takosuke around and fire when he does, and a jellyfish-shaped shield.PentarouPentarouPentarou is a penguin that travels through space and shoots out of his mouth and other places. His upgrades are missiles that travel along the ground and ceiling, a double-shot, an exploding shot, small penguins that travel close to Pentarou and shoot when he does, and a bubble shield.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Pasocomic Purple Cat is a collection of seven short stories. These stories have no connection to each other and focus heavily on sexual situations, mainly involving young girls in bunny costumes, and also including a sci-fi scenario and a medieval fantasy torture-related story entitled Bizarre Princess. The stories are presented as comic book-like screens with text as well as text-only screens.Some of the stories are completely non-interactive, while others feature rudimentary player input by prompting him to make a text-based selection, slightly altering subsequent text and scenes.</plot>

				<title_clean>Pasocomic Purple Cat Vol.3 - The Onna Kyoushi Tokushuu</title_clean>
				<plot>The third volume of the Purple Cat series is, like its predecessors, a collection of barely interactive short stories heavy on explicit sexual content. This edition particularly focuses on stories involving female school teachers, but also contains the third part of the Bizarre Princess story. Like in the previous games, interaction is restricted to rare instances during which the player is prompted to make a choice, slightly affecting subsequent scenes.</plot>

				<title_clean>Phalanx</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Phalanx is a side-scrolling shoot 'em up originally developed and published by ZOOM for Japanese-only Sharp X68000 home computers in 1991. As with most entries in the shooter genre, the story is minimal: players pilot a lone space-faring fighter craft, the eponymous A-144/R "Phalanx", in a one-man assault against a mysterious fleet of alien "bio-ships" that have attacked a human colony on planet Delia IV. Along with a unique power-up system, the game also incorporates adjustable ship speeds and a health meter for the player's ship, both of which were uncommon features among shooters at the time.Phalanx was later ported to the Super Famicom and SNES by Kemco in 1992 for the game's first North American and European releases. The SNES version removed most of the anime-style cutscenes present in the X68000 version and featured new music. The SNES release of Phalanx in North America is notable for its unusual box art depicting an elderly banjo player and a distant spaceship streaking across the background, a scene that is never referenced in the game itself. A Game Boy Advance version was ported in 2001, and a downloadable remake of Phalanx based on the original X68000 version was published on the Japanese Wii Shop in 2009.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The first stage in Phalanx's SNES version. The background is comprised of seven layers of parallax scrolling.Phalanx is a side-scrolling space shooter in the vein of Gradius or R-Type. The game features three selectable difficulty levels by default, and a fourth expert level of difficulty called "Funny" can be accessed by entering a cheat code at the title screen. The player's "Phalanx" fighter craft has the ability to adjust between three different movement speeds, allowing for greater flexibility while evading threats. Unlike most shoot 'em ups, the player's ship can take up to three hits in the original version of the game before losing a life, and ship health can be replenished by obtaining certain power-ups. Phalanx is also equipped with three weapon slots for upgradable primary weapon power-ups that can be swapped between on-the-fly. If the player obtains a fourth weapon power-up, the weapon in the left slot will be discarded to accommodate the new item. Primary weapon power-ups can be consumed at any time to activate a powerful special attack, and each primary weapon features its own unique special attack. A handful of secondary missile power-ups are fired alongside the ship's primary weapon and do not occupy a weapon slot.Certain gameplay features were altered between Phalanx's releases across different platforms. Secondary missiles have a limited ammo supply in the original X68000 release, whereas all subsequent ports of the game feature unlimited missiles. In order to further reduce the difficulty of the GBA version, the player ship's health was increased to four units instead of three. The ship also features an additional weapons slot on GBA, granting players a total of four weapon slots.Power-Up ItemsEnergy Compressor (E) - Fires energy blasts straight ahead that can be charged to unleash a larger, more powerful projectile. Its special attack, the Anti-Matter Detonator, damages all on-screen enemies for a short time.Homing Beam (H) - Fires spheres of light that track enemies. The projectiles' size increases when upgraded. The High Energy Shield special attack creates a damage shield around Phalanx that also grants temporary invincibility.Needle Laser (L) - A piercing laser that can pass through solid walls and enemies. The number of bolts increases with upgrades. This weapon also fires backwards once fully-upgraded. When activated, the Spiral Attack causes Phalanx to spin while auto-firing in all directions for several seconds.Reflector (R) - Fires projectiles that bounce off of solid walls, making this weapon ideal for confined areas. Its fully-upgraded version also fires backwards. The Stalker Drone special attack creates an autonomous drone that seeks out and destroys enemies one at a time for several seconds.Homing Missiles (A) - Secondary missiles that home-in on enemies.Penetrator Missiles (B) - Secondary missiles that fire straight ahead and can pass through enemies.Guided Missiles (C) - Secondary missiles that mimic the player's movements after being fired.Power Capsule (P) - Upgrades the ship's primary weapon by one level and replenishes one unit of health. The ship's default primary weapon can also be upgraded.[CR][B]Stages:[/B][CR]1st Mission: Assault - Players begins their assault on the enemy fleet in the skies above Delia IV. After descending through the cloud cover, the fighter craft encounters a large enemy ship that attempts to swat the player with a pair of flailing arms.2nd Mission: Under Water - Phalanx enters the planet's system of aqueducts, where the force of the water will slow the ship considerably. The submarine boss fires large torpedoes that explode into showers of bullets.3rd Mission: Bio Cave - A series of tightly-enclosed passages make navigation tricky in this auto-scrolling stage. Destroying a large metal capsule at the end of the stage triggers the appearance of a small spherical boss that continuously tracks the player's ship while firing homing projectiles.4th Mission: Deep Core - This fast-paced stage takes place in an enormous rocky cave with plenty of space to maneuver. The stage's boss has several parts: a large ship that fires energy bolts straight ahead, as well as a detachable organic section defended by a small orb that also fires projectiles. Once the organic section is sufficiently damaged, its eye will detach and attempt to crash into the player's ship until it is destroyed.5th Mission: Destroyer - A unique stage that takes place both around and inside a massive alien spaceship. Players must carefully pilot Phalanx through the destroyer's narrow passages to defeat two mini-bosses. This opens the door to the stage boss, a mobile turret attached to the walls of a long metal tunnel.6th Mission: Advertise Area - Giant billboards drift through an asteroid field in this neon-drenched space stage. The stage boss is a bio-ship with a single flexible arm and extendable neck.7th Mission: Hyper Space - Phalanx enters a hyperspace tunnel leading straight to the alien base. A mask-like construct embedded in the wall at the stage's end serves as the boss.Last Mission: Charge - Inside the main base of the alien invasion force, players must penetrate the enemy's last line of defense before facing the game's final boss: a huge single-celled organism.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Pipe Dream</title_clean>
				<plot>Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".</plot>

				<title_clean>Populous</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released in 1989, Populous was the third offering of Peter Molyneux's then-nascent UK development studio, Bullfrog Productions, and it was the company's first title to be met with both widespread commercial success and a significant amount of critical recognition. Originally developed for the Amiga, Atari ST, and PC platforms, the premise of Populous is simple: the player is a god, and as such, has world-altering powers that can be used for the betterment of one's own devotees or the detriment of all unbelievers. From an isometric perspective, the player uses both direct control of the game world and indirect interaction with followers in order to ensure the prosperity and growth of their people first and foremost. The player's divine powers grow in direct relation to the overall fortunes of their faithful, and the ultimate objective of each scenario is to become powerful enough to challenge and conquer an opposing deity with worshipers and abilities of its own.European Cover ArtAside from putting Bullfrog Productions and its designer Peter Molyneux on the proverbial map as game developers, Populous was an influential game in its own right recognized by many as the starting point of the god game, a sub-genre of strategy/simulation games in which players are cast as powerful beings whose prime directive is the stewardship of their followers. Many of the mechanics laid down in Populous would be used in future Bullfrog games (Powermonger and Dungeon Keeper, for instance), and Molyneux's first project at Lionhead Studios, 2001's Black &amp; White, is commonly viewed as an attempt to evolve the ideas presented in the Populous games, and as a result is often called the spiritual successor to the series. Furthermore, games made thereafter, such as 2011's From Dust, that feature environmental manipulation for the specific purpose of aiding a group of people outside of the player's direct control are usually said to draw their lineage directly from Populous.The success of Populous led to two expansions, The Promised Lands and The Final Frontier (both of which were released in 1989), as well as two sequels, Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods in 1992, and Populous: The Beginning in 1998. In 2008, an updated port of Populous dubbed Populous DS was released for the Nintendo DS by Japanese developer Genki. It was created with the ostensible goal of "retaining the feel" of the original Populous while also adding new features such as updated visuals, touch screen support, wireless multiplayer, and five new gods each with distinct gameplay differences.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game interface: mini-map (upper left), Manna Bar and Information Shield (upper right), command icons (lower left), and playing field (center)The most important imperative in the game is the growth of one's follower population (hence the game's name). The player can facilitate faster growth primarily by ensuring that followers have adequate surfaces upon which to build their settlements. The more uniform the landscape, the larger the settlement that can be built there, and larger settlements reward players with greater defense and better technology. Smaller settlements do have their place, though, as they are quicker to erect and much faster to populate, making for much more rapid expansion. Population size affects what abilities the player has access to, as all physical manifestations of divine power cost manna, and this manna is directly derived from followers, thus more of one means more of the other. Additionally, since the player exerts no direct control over their subjects, having a numerical advantage is the easiest way to ensure victory when encountering rival followers. Many godly powers, such as Earthquake and Volcano, are directly designed to hinder an opponent's ability to effectively settle their land and thus grow stronger.Once one's follower population has grown to a sufficient size, the player's main goal is to overcome an enemy deity whose presence threatens their own supremacy. Encounters with the enemy will happen as a natural byproduct of expansion on most maps, though when the time comes followers can also be directed specifically to seek out and subdue opposing settlers. In order to be fully victorious and move on to the next map, all enemy followers and domiciles must be killed or destroyed. Opposing forces will automatically fight when they come into contact with one another, and the victor is determined purely on relative strength, which is in turn determined by the number of followers in a stack and the level of technology they possess. Settlement size comes into play here once again, as larger buildings allow for greater technological achievements than smaller ones. The number of citizens within a stack can be increased manually by ordering followers to gather together; any two friendly units which contact one another will combine into a single, stronger unit.ModesA mysterious confidant congratulates the player between missions.Populous has three main modes of play: Tutorial, Conquest, and Custom. The Tutorial mode consists of a preset map designed more than anything to allow players to familiarize themselves with the game's controls and the various powers at their disposal. Conquest is the main mode of Populous, which allows players to progress through a series of 500 maps, conquering one world at a time before moving on to the next. Player performance is key to progression in this mode, as the player does not simply progress in linear fashion through each map. Rather, the player's score at the end of each mission is taken as an indicator of one's relative skill, and the difficulty of the next mission is chosen as a direct reflection of said score. Mission objective do not change over the course of Conquest mode, though the aptitude of one's opposition (as well as the powers available to them) will increase over time. Several different terrain types come into play as well, though their effects on gameplay is decidedly subtle. Settlers can die more easily on a desert world, for example, and population growth is stunted on an ice planet. Though the player can save their game at any time, the name of each planet also serves as a password of sorts, allowing players to jump to a specific world by simply inputting its name. The final mode of play is Custom, which pulls triple duty of serving as the game's portal for playing scenarios with customized parameters, creating custom maps, and also connecting to a second player (via modem) for multiplayer skirmishes.Inspecting the Game WorldThe Information Shield, complete with Population Bars (sides)Seeing as the player has no real dominion over the individual activities of worshipers, various tools are provided to allow players to quickly survey their surroundings and also gauge the level of efficacy of followers and buildings. Individual targets can be selected at any time by using the Query button, which causes a shield icon to appear next to the selected object. This indicates that any information appearing in the upper-right status shield pertains specifically to this target (which can in turn be located at any time by using the Zoom to Shield button). The status shield is divided into four quadrants. The quadrant in the upper left simply indicates which side the selected target belongs to, with an ankh signifying good, and a skull signifying evil. The quadrant to its right shows the target's level of sophistication, with more advanced weapon icons indicating a greater level of technology. The lower left quadrant shows a representation of the selected target, while the lower right displays two bars. In the case of a building, these bars show overall defense in yellow on the left, and progress toward production of the next follower in green on the right. In the case of followers, two orange bars showing unit strength fill over time. Once both bars have been filled, the left bar changes to yellow, indicating that it is gauging higher strength values than before. On either side of the Information Shield are two additional bars which show the population size of both the good and evil players on the left and right sides respectively.QueryQueryThe Query button allows the player to quickly ascertain the strength of a given target, whether they be friendly or hostile. Querying a target will persist until another target is queried, so it is possible, for instance, to use it as an easy way to keep track of an opposing leader's activities, or, when used with Zoom to Shield, to be able to quickly shift focus to a location of the player's choosing.Zoom to ShieldZoom to ShieldThe Zoom to Shield command serves to quickly refocus the player's field of view upon the last queried target. Naturally, if the player has yet to use the Query function, the Zoom to Shield icon does nothing. This mainly serves to allow players to quickly see something that might not be covered by other Zoom functions.Zoom to LeaderZoom to LeaderPressing the Zoom to Leader button, unsurprisingly, centers the player's view upon the leader of their followers. If the player's people are currently leaderless, then this function will center the field of view upon the player's Papal Magnet, usually the site of their leader's demise, until such time as a new leader has been chosen.Zoom to KnightZoom to KnightThe function of the Zoom to Knight button changes depending on whether the player left- or right-clicks. Upon left-clicking, it will cycle between all knights that the player currently possesses; when right-clicking, however, it will rotate its focus instead through all of the player's various settlements.Zoom to BattleZoom to BattleA simple click of the Zoom to Battle button will jump the camera instantly to any active hostile engagements, and, if there are more than one, it will cycle between all confrontations upon additional clicks. Like most Zoom functions, if there are no valid targets to jump to, pressing the button has no effect.Divine MandatesThough no true control is given over one's followers (alternately called walkers) in Populous, as the object of their worship the player is given the prerogative to direct the focus of their attentions. There are four options for influencing the behavior of walkers, and regardless of which is chosen, the player's people will dutifully endeavor to conform to this mandate in order to better satisfy their god. Directives do not require manna in the same way that physical manifestations of power do, though at the same time their effects are not nearly as dramatic nor as immediate.Go to MagnetGo to MagnetThe Go to Magnet command instructs all followers to gather around their leader, who will in turn go toward the Papal Magnet. In situations where the player's leader has died, this instructs followers to head directly toward the Magnet, where the first follower to touch the Magnet will be appointed the new leader.SettleSettleFaithful who have been directed to settle will look around their environment for suitable land upon which to erect new buildings, with preference being given for unexplored areas. Regardless of where they choose to settle, settlers will always construct the largest settlement that their particular plot of land allows.Gather TogetherGather TogetherThe Gather Together function implores a player's followers to search for others of their tribe so that they might commune with them. If successful, the two walkers will band together, forming a single more powerful unit. If unsuccessful in finding others, a follower will simply attempt to construct more settlements.FightFightWalkers that have been instructed to fight will actively search for any non-allied units and attempt to defeat them before repeating the process. Much like the Gather Together mandate, if a follower is unable to find suitable targets in its immediate vicinity, it will choose instead to build new settlements.Divine InterventionOften it is required that a god take matters into its own hands, and for these situations there are a variety of choices for direct intervention. Just below the player's Information Shield is the Manna Bar, which shows what godly powers are currently available for use. Various icons representing specific powers are arrayed along this bar, and once the Manna Bar's indicator arrow has reached the icon for a specific power, this indicates that it can be used. These range from minor displays like slightly modifying the height of land to more cataclysmic ones like Armageddon. Having a larger number of followers will raise the manna indicator arrow quicker and also allow for more frequent use of powers, as manna can be replenished more quickly with more devotees.Raise/Lower LandRaise/Lower LandThe least expensive and ironically most important of the godly powers is the ability to raise and lower land, which helps primarily to make the environment more habitable for one's followers. Left-clicking while in this mode will raise the plot of land where the player's cursor currently resides, while right-clicking will lower it.Papal MagnetPapal MagnetPlacing a Papal Magnet on any are of the map will designate that point as a beacon to which allied followers are drawn. When a leader dies or is knighted, the Papal Magnate's position is fixed to the last place that the leader occupied, and cannot be repositioned until the player has appointed a new leader through the Go to Magnet command.EarthquakeEarthquakeThe Earthquake ability randomly rearranges all tiles withinin the player's current field of view, disrupting settlements and any other activities within the area. As the cheapest disruption spell available in most scenarios, it is one of the more common ways of hindering the development of rival walkers.SwampSwampUse of the Swamp ability creates a swamp on any flat surface within the field of view. Depending on mission parameters, this will swallow up either a single walker or all walkers who attempt to traverse it. Swamp tiles can only be destroyed by raising or lowering the land tile upon which they are situated.KnightKnightBy invoking the Knight ability, the player's current leader is transformed into a powerful knight that will tirelessly harass the enemy, killing walkers and burning settlements to the ground until it is killed. It is possible for a player to have multiple knights concurrently by selecting and knighting new leaders through the Papal Magnet.VolcanoVolcanoThe area within the field of view is dramatically raised and filled with rocky obstructions when the player summons a volcano. Use of this ability is primarily a disruption tactic much like the use of Earthquake, though the effects are much more time-consuming to reverse than its cheaper cousin.FloodFloodUnlike most land-altering invocations, Flood affects the entire map rather than limiting itself to only the player's field of view, raising the water level of the entire world by one. Special care should be taken before using it to ensure that one's own population won't be more adversely affected by this than the enemy's.ArmageddonArmageddonEssentially a game-ender, Armageddon razes all buildings on the map and calls all followers to the center of the level in order to wage a winner-takes-all showdown in which the player left standing is the ultimate victor. For players who are sure of their own tribe's superiority, this can save a significant amount of hassle.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Populous II</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Released in 1989, Populous was the third offering of Peter Molyneux's then-nascent UK development studio, Bullfrog Productions, and it was the company's first title to be met with both widespread commercial success and a significant amount of critical recognition. Originally developed for the Amiga, Atari ST, and PC platforms, the premise of Populous is simple: the player is a god, and as such, has world-altering powers that can be used for the betterment of one's own devotees or the detriment of all unbelievers. From an isometric perspective, the player uses both direct control of the game world and indirect interaction with followers in order to ensure the prosperity and growth of their people first and foremost. The player's divine powers grow in direct relation to the overall fortunes of their faithful, and the ultimate objective of each scenario is to become powerful enough to challenge and conquer an opposing deity with worshipers and abilities of its own.European Cover ArtAside from putting Bullfrog Productions and its designer Peter Molyneux on the proverbial map as game developers, Populous was an influential game in its own right recognized by many as the starting point of the god game, a sub-genre of strategy/simulation games in which players are cast as powerful beings whose prime directive is the stewardship of their followers. Many of the mechanics laid down in Populous would be used in future Bullfrog games (Powermonger and Dungeon Keeper, for instance), and Molyneux's first project at Lionhead Studios, 2001's Black &amp; White, is commonly viewed as an attempt to evolve the ideas presented in the Populous games, and as a result is often called the spiritual successor to the series. Furthermore, games made thereafter, such as 2011's From Dust, that feature environmental manipulation for the specific purpose of aiding a group of people outside of the player's direct control are usually said to draw their lineage directly from Populous.The success of Populous led to two expansions, The Promised Lands and The Final Frontier (both of which were released in 1989), as well as two sequels, Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods in 1992, and Populous: The Beginning in 1998. In 2008, an updated port of Populous dubbed Populous DS was released for the Nintendo DS by Japanese developer Genki. It was created with the ostensible goal of "retaining the feel" of the original Populous while also adding new features such as updated visuals, touch screen support, wireless multiplayer, and five new gods each with distinct gameplay differences.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game interface: mini-map (upper left), Manna Bar and Information Shield (upper right), command icons (lower left), and playing field (center)The most important imperative in the game is the growth of one's follower population (hence the game's name). The player can facilitate faster growth primarily by ensuring that followers have adequate surfaces upon which to build their settlements. The more uniform the landscape, the larger the settlement that can be built there, and larger settlements reward players with greater defense and better technology. Smaller settlements do have their place, though, as they are quicker to erect and much faster to populate, making for much more rapid expansion. Population size affects what abilities the player has access to, as all physical manifestations of divine power cost manna, and this manna is directly derived from followers, thus more of one means more of the other. Additionally, since the player exerts no direct control over their subjects, having a numerical advantage is the easiest way to ensure victory when encountering rival followers. Many godly powers, such as Earthquake and Volcano, are directly designed to hinder an opponent's ability to effectively settle their land and thus grow stronger.Once one's follower population has grown to a sufficient size, the player's main goal is to overcome an enemy deity whose presence threatens their own supremacy. Encounters with the enemy will happen as a natural byproduct of expansion on most maps, though when the time comes followers can also be directed specifically to seek out and subdue opposing settlers. In order to be fully victorious and move on to the next map, all enemy followers and domiciles must be killed or destroyed. Opposing forces will automatically fight when they come into contact with one another, and the victor is determined purely on relative strength, which is in turn determined by the number of followers in a stack and the level of technology they possess. Settlement size comes into play here once again, as larger buildings allow for greater technological achievements than smaller ones. The number of citizens within a stack can be increased manually by ordering followers to gather together; any two friendly units which contact one another will combine into a single, stronger unit.ModesA mysterious confidant congratulates the player between missions.Populous has three main modes of play: Tutorial, Conquest, and Custom. The Tutorial mode consists of a preset map designed more than anything to allow players to familiarize themselves with the game's controls and the various powers at their disposal. Conquest is the main mode of Populous, which allows players to progress through a series of 500 maps, conquering one world at a time before moving on to the next. Player performance is key to progression in this mode, as the player does not simply progress in linear fashion through each map. Rather, the player's score at the end of each mission is taken as an indicator of one's relative skill, and the difficulty of the next mission is chosen as a direct reflection of said score. Mission objective do not change over the course of Conquest mode, though the aptitude of one's opposition (as well as the powers available to them) will increase over time. Several different terrain types come into play as well, though their effects on gameplay is decidedly subtle. Settlers can die more easily on a desert world, for example, and population growth is stunted on an ice planet. Though the player can save their game at any time, the name of each planet also serves as a password of sorts, allowing players to jump to a specific world by simply inputting its name. The final mode of play is Custom, which pulls triple duty of serving as the game's portal for playing scenarios with customized parameters, creating custom maps, and also connecting to a second player (via modem) for multiplayer skirmishes.Inspecting the Game WorldThe Information Shield, complete with Population Bars (sides)Seeing as the player has no real dominion over the individual activities of worshipers, various tools are provided to allow players to quickly survey their surroundings and also gauge the level of efficacy of followers and buildings. Individual targets can be selected at any time by using the Query button, which causes a shield icon to appear next to the selected object. This indicates that any information appearing in the upper-right status shield pertains specifically to this target (which can in turn be located at any time by using the Zoom to Shield button). The status shield is divided into four quadrants. The quadrant in the upper left simply indicates which side the selected target belongs to, with an ankh signifying good, and a skull signifying evil. The quadrant to its right shows the target's level of sophistication, with more advanced weapon icons indicating a greater level of technology. The lower left quadrant shows a representation of the selected target, while the lower right displays two bars. In the case of a building, these bars show overall defense in yellow on the left, and progress toward production of the next follower in green on the right. In the case of followers, two orange bars showing unit strength fill over time. Once both bars have been filled, the left bar changes to yellow, indicating that it is gauging higher strength values than before. On either side of the Information Shield are two additional bars which show the population size of both the good and evil players on the left and right sides respectively.QueryQueryThe Query button allows the player to quickly ascertain the strength of a given target, whether they be friendly or hostile. Querying a target will persist until another target is queried, so it is possible, for instance, to use it as an easy way to keep track of an opposing leader's activities, or, when used with Zoom to Shield, to be able to quickly shift focus to a location of the player's choosing.Zoom to ShieldZoom to ShieldThe Zoom to Shield command serves to quickly refocus the player's field of view upon the last queried target. Naturally, if the player has yet to use the Query function, the Zoom to Shield icon does nothing. This mainly serves to allow players to quickly see something that might not be covered by other Zoom functions.Zoom to LeaderZoom to LeaderPressing the Zoom to Leader button, unsurprisingly, centers the player's view upon the leader of their followers. If the player's people are currently leaderless, then this function will center the field of view upon the player's Papal Magnet, usually the site of their leader's demise, until such time as a new leader has been chosen.Zoom to KnightZoom to KnightThe function of the Zoom to Knight button changes depending on whether the player left- or right-clicks. Upon left-clicking, it will cycle between all knights that the player currently possesses; when right-clicking, however, it will rotate its focus instead through all of the player's various settlements.Zoom to BattleZoom to BattleA simple click of the Zoom to Battle button will jump the camera instantly to any active hostile engagements, and, if there are more than one, it will cycle between all confrontations upon additional clicks. Like most Zoom functions, if there are no valid targets to jump to, pressing the button has no effect.Divine MandatesThough no true control is given over one's followers (alternately called walkers) in Populous, as the object of their worship the player is given the prerogative to direct the focus of their attentions. There are four options for influencing the behavior of walkers, and regardless of which is chosen, the player's people will dutifully endeavor to conform to this mandate in order to better satisfy their god. Directives do not require manna in the same way that physical manifestations of power do, though at the same time their effects are not nearly as dramatic nor as immediate.Go to MagnetGo to MagnetThe Go to Magnet command instructs all followers to gather around their leader, who will in turn go toward the Papal Magnet. In situations where the player's leader has died, this instructs followers to head directly toward the Magnet, where the first follower to touch the Magnet will be appointed the new leader.SettleSettleFaithful who have been directed to settle will look around their environment for suitable land upon which to erect new buildings, with preference being given for unexplored areas. Regardless of where they choose to settle, settlers will always construct the largest settlement that their particular plot of land allows.Gather TogetherGather TogetherThe Gather Together function implores a player's followers to search for others of their tribe so that they might commune with them. If successful, the two walkers will band together, forming a single more powerful unit. If unsuccessful in finding others, a follower will simply attempt to construct more settlements.FightFightWalkers that have been instructed to fight will actively search for any non-allied units and attempt to defeat them before repeating the process. Much like the Gather Together mandate, if a follower is unable to find suitable targets in its immediate vicinity, it will choose instead to build new settlements.Divine InterventionOften it is required that a god take matters into its own hands, and for these situations there are a variety of choices for direct intervention. Just below the player's Information Shield is the Manna Bar, which shows what godly powers are currently available for use. Various icons representing specific powers are arrayed along this bar, and once the Manna Bar's indicator arrow has reached the icon for a specific power, this indicates that it can be used. These range from minor displays like slightly modifying the height of land to more cataclysmic ones like Armageddon. Having a larger number of followers will raise the manna indicator arrow quicker and also allow for more frequent use of powers, as manna can be replenished more quickly with more devotees.Raise/Lower LandRaise/Lower LandThe least expensive and ironically most important of the godly powers is the ability to raise and lower land, which helps primarily to make the environment more habitable for one's followers. Left-clicking while in this mode will raise the plot of land where the player's cursor currently resides, while right-clicking will lower it.Papal MagnetPapal MagnetPlacing a Papal Magnet on any are of the map will designate that point as a beacon to which allied followers are drawn. When a leader dies or is knighted, the Papal Magnate's position is fixed to the last place that the leader occupied, and cannot be repositioned until the player has appointed a new leader through the Go to Magnet command.EarthquakeEarthquakeThe Earthquake ability randomly rearranges all tiles withinin the player's current field of view, disrupting settlements and any other activities within the area. As the cheapest disruption spell available in most scenarios, it is one of the more common ways of hindering the development of rival walkers.SwampSwampUse of the Swamp ability creates a swamp on any flat surface within the field of view. Depending on mission parameters, this will swallow up either a single walker or all walkers who attempt to traverse it. Swamp tiles can only be destroyed by raising or lowering the land tile upon which they are situated.KnightKnightBy invoking the Knight ability, the player's current leader is transformed into a powerful knight that will tirelessly harass the enemy, killing walkers and burning settlements to the ground until it is killed. It is possible for a player to have multiple knights concurrently by selecting and knighting new leaders through the Papal Magnet.VolcanoVolcanoThe area within the field of view is dramatically raised and filled with rocky obstructions when the player summons a volcano. Use of this ability is primarily a disruption tactic much like the use of Earthquake, though the effects are much more time-consuming to reverse than its cheaper cousin.FloodFloodUnlike most land-altering invocations, Flood affects the entire map rather than limiting itself to only the player's field of view, raising the water level of the entire world by one. Special care should be taken before using it to ensure that one's own population won't be more adversely affected by this than the enemy's.ArmageddonArmageddonEssentially a game-ender, Armageddon razes all buildings on the map and calls all followers to the center of the level in order to wage a winner-takes-all showdown in which the player left standing is the ultimate victor. For players who are sure of their own tribe's superiority, this can save a significant amount of hassle.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Powermonger</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Power Monger, or Powermonger, is a god sim game from Populous creator Peter Molyneux. It builds on Populous, borrowing elements but adding a whole lot more besides, including a 3D map that can be rotated around to an extent and an "artificial life" engine that allows for complex AI behavior that occurs naturally with little amounts of input from the player.It was released on many European and Japanese home computers, as well as on the SNES, Sega Genesis and Sega CD consoles in multiple regions. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The game features a 3D game map, although camera movement was limited to rotating the map in 90-degree intervals and 8 pre-defined levels of zoom. Only the map itself is three dimensional, people, trees and other game objects where comprised of sprites. The game also features a fairly advanced "artificial life" engine. Each person seem to have a mind of their own and will go about his or her job, fishing, farming, shepherding, collecting wood or making items without any input from the player. On death, citizens and soldiers alike would rise heavenwards in angelic form. The player also have a query tool that can be used to see the name, sex, age, allegiance, vital stats, hometown and equipment for any given person they click on. While the player cannot form the land, their actions can still have some limited effect on the environment. For example if the player deforests a big area the weather pattern will change and more rain or snow (depending on season) will fall, making movement slower.The player starts out on each map with a small number of soldiers, and maybe a few towns already under their control. To win the map they need to tip the balance of power completely to their side (represented by a scale below the mini-map), by conquering all (or at least most) of the towns on the map, and kill any opposing captains. Once a town is under the player's control, they can draft the locals into their army and take on bigger towns or enemy armies. Some of the bigger towns also have neutral captains and if these survive the battle and the player conquers the town they come under their command as well. The player can only control as many armies as they have captains so it's important to keep them alive - if a captain is killed his army is disbanded and his surviving solders go back to their town of origin. Unlike the main army which the main character commands, the subordinate captains have a "lag" time. The further away from the main character they are, the longer it takes for orders to reach them. When issuing orders via the captains, a useful and sometimes amusing feedback is provided: the affirmative voice sample is played at a pitch that signals the wisdom of the player's commands.Food is the single most important resource in the game, the expression "an army marches on its belly" is very true in Power Monger, therefore it is often smart to not to draft a whole town's population into an army, because an empty town will not produce food (or more people). Aside from friendly towns the player can also slaughter wandering sheep (by ordering the army to attack it), barter food from neutral towns, or kill an enemy captain and pillage his food supply. Aside from manpower and food towns can also provide equipment. Townspeople will occasionally make stuff, but to speed things up the player can order an army to "invent" at a friendly town. Depending on nearby resources and what posture the army is set to (passive, neutral or aggressive) the player's men will then go to work collecting resources and make items. As the more useful items can usually only be made in one or two towns on any given map these have great strategic importance.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Premium consists of four scenarios, each one of which is dedicated entirely to sex (sometimes with a bit of conversation and very straight-forward seduction before). There is no real story, just a series of encounters of nameless protagonists with different types of young women. Each of the four scenarios is dedicated to a specific occupation, which are: school girl, maid, magician, and finally Buddhist nun. The gameplay is very simple; even though there are verb commands, they are always situation-specific, and the player can advance the game by going through the few commands to trigger the next scene, which makes Premium more of a visual novel than an adventure.</plot>

				<plot>Premium 2 has exactly the same premise as its  predecessor - play through four erotic scenarios, each dedicated to a specific theme, without any over-arching story line. The gameplay is exactly the same as in the previous game: the player goes through simple context-specific commands to trigger the next scene. The situations are entirely dedicated to sex.The four scenarios of Premium 2 are: a hospital scenario, in which the protagonist is the hospital manager who has sex with nurses, doctors, and patients; a fantasy scenario, in which the protagonist is transported into the realm of goddesses and female warriors; an office scenario, with receptionists, "office ladies", businesswomen, etc.; and a night life scenario, where the hero visits night clubs, massage parlors, etc., having sex with waitresses, hostesses and alike.</plot>

				<title_clean>Prince of Persia</title_clean>
				<plot>While the Sultan of Persia is fighting a war in a foreign country, his Grand Vizier Jaffar orchestrates a coup d'&#233;tat. His way to the throne lies through the Sultan's lovely daughter. Jaffar kidnaps her and threatens to kill her if she refuses to marry him. Meanwhile, the man the Princess loves is thrown into the dungeon. He has only one hour to escape from his prison, defeat the guards on his way, and stop Jaffar before the terrible marriage takes place.Prince of Persia is a 2D platformer that is commonly regarded as a progenitor of the cinematic platform genre. Rather than following the more common jump-and-run mechanics, it focuses on careful advancement through fairly complex levels, emphasizing the protagonist's vulnerability and survival aspect. Rotoscoping technique is used to give more realism to the animation of the characters' movements.The protagonist must avoid deadly traps, solve some simple jumping and environmental puzzles (such as stepping on pressure plates to raise portcullis), and engage in sword fights with the guards. The player character has an infinite amount of lives, but has to restart at the beginning of a level each time he dies, and must complete the game within an hour. The hero starts with three units of health, which can be replenished with small health potions or permanently increased with large jars.The Game Boy Color and SNES versions of the game feature additional levels and new enemies. The Genesis version has a new intro, an altered set of graphics and four new levels.</plot>

				<title_clean>Pro Student G</title_clean>
				<plot>By the end of the 20th century, radical educational reforms have transformed the Japanese society. Students were split into opposing groups, and the more aggressive of those eventually formed a dominant organization named Order of Black Phoenix, centered on the cult of a mysterious person known as "The Queen". Outcast students have escaped to a secluded island near Okinawa. A wandering lazy and lecherous manga and anime fan named Gor&#333; End&#333; teams up with a female teacher and a few students to lead an opposition force against the oppressive governing circles.Pro Student G is a Japanese-style erotic comedy adventure. The player guides Gor&#333; through a series of locations and encounters, selecting choices from a menu to trigger the next event and advance the story. Some choices have a traditional verb-object structure, while others incorporate context-specific actions, many of which are included for humorous effect.</plot>

				<title_clean>Puyo Puyo</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Puyo Puyo is an arcade puzzle game featuring characters from Compile's Madou Monogatari RPG franchise. It is often referred to as first game of the Puyo Puyo series, despite the fact that an earlier Puyo Puyo title exists. The game was developed by Compile and published by Sega on their Mega Drive-based System C2 hardware. As opposed to its predecessor, the arcade Puyo Puyo places a heavy emphasis on competitive play; the game's single player mode consist of a 13-match gauntlet against various Madou Monogatari enemies, while the multiplayer mode pits two players against each other in a 2-out-of-3 Puyo match.The arcade version was ported to a variety of platforms. Three of these home ports would be extensively modified for worldwide release: the Genesis and Game Gear ports became Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, while the SNES port (Super Puyo Puyo) became Kirby's Avalanche.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player fighting DracoPuyo Puyo is a puzzle game with two players, although one may be controlled by the computer. Pieces come down in pairs, sometimes of different colors. When players connect at least four pieces, they "pop" those pieces, making them disappear. Two pieces are "connected" when they touch horizontally or vertically but not diagonally. Pieces that were above the popped pieces then fall down to fill the void created. The falling pieces can then create a connection of four similar colored pieces, thus causing a chain.When the player successfully pops pieces, they send "garbage" pieces are the opposing player, falling from random columns. The more pieces in a pop and the longer the chain, the more pieces are sent. These garbage pieces are uncolored and do not chain but if they are adjacent (again, vertically or horizontally but not diagonally) to a popped colored piece, then they also disappear.The player that hits the top of the well loses.Game ModesPuyo Puyo is split into two modes:Single Puyo PuyoIn the game's single player mode, the player assumes the role of Arle Nadja, a sorceress who takes pleasure in ruining Satan's plans. There are three difficulty levels: "Beginner" gives the player three easy opponents unrelated to the main game, "Normal" starts the player at Stage 1 (vs. Draco Centauros), while "Difficult" starts the player at Stage 4 (vs. Harpy). There are 13 stages in the normal game, the last of which is a battle against Satan himself.Double Puyo PuyoThis is basically multiplayer mode. In it two players play against each other. By out-chaining the other player, the player fills out his grid and that leads to victory.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]ProtagonistsArle Nadja: The protagonist. She sets it as her goal to defeat Satan, after he tries to steal her beloved pet Carbuncle, which she loves more than anything. She is a sorceress that can cast Ice, Lightning and Fire.Carbuncle: Arle's beloved pet, the one Satan attempts to steal.Beginner OpponentsSkeleton T: A skeleton that loves drinking herbal tea.Nasu Grave: An eggplant that wears square glasses. He jumps up and down most of the time, as he is too slow to runMummy: An Egyptian mummy who walks around wrapped in bandagesNormal / Difficult OpponentsDraco Centauros: A half-human, half-dragon girl who can manipulate fire.Suketoudara: A fish with muscular human arms and legs.Sukiyapodes: A one-legged, baby-faced monster.Harpy: An angel-like girl that sings out-of-tune, high-pitched songs.Sasoriman: A guard disguised as a scorpion.Panotty: A flute-playing sprite who becomes enraged when Arle doesn't dance to his song.Zombie: A zombie put together by spare parts.Witch: A witch who is prone to random giggles.Zoh Daimaoh: A raging Indian elephant whose Puyo causes the screen to shake.Schezo Wegey: A dark wizard whose desire for Arle's power is comically misconstrued.Minotauros: A minotaur who serves Rulue.Rulue: A female martial artist who is madly in love with Satan. As she was not faced in combat in the original versions of Madou Monogatari, she does not have a voice clip to introduce herself with.Satan: The final boss; a horned demon man who wants to be Arle's fiance.[CR]English Localizations[CR]"Silvana" vs. "Goby Captain" in the English version of unknown origin.An English-translated version of the arcade release was released in Europe, but the authenticity of this version is disputed; it is not known whether the game was officially localized by Compile/Sega or if it is an unlicensed bootleg. In addition to adding English voice work (and removing the wings from Harpy's sprites), this version changes almost all of the character names. One specific name change, Satan to "Dark Prince," is also used in the English versions of the Neo Geo Pocket Color Puyo Pop and GBA Puyo Pop.Though the Game Gear port was not released outside of Japan, playing the game in a non-Japanese system will reveal an English version named "Puzlow Kids." Notably, the ending text of Puzlow Kids's scenario mode is identical to the script of the English arcade release; this includes a mention of "the Dark Prince." However, Puyo were renamed to "P-Kids" in this version, while they are known as "PuyoPuyo" in the English arcade game.Sega and Nintendo published their own localized versions of Puyo Puyo, though they both stripped the Madou Madogatari characters from the game and used their well-known franchises instead. Sega used characters from The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon to create Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, while Nintendo and HAL Laboratory used Kirby characters to make Kirby's Avalanche. Mean Bean Machine drops the difficulty level system (and the beginner characters with it), but includes a password feature; the game also reuses several Puyo Puyo BGM tracks, such as Satan's theme becoming the Verses Mode and Danger themes. Kirby's Avalanche does not make any gameplay changes but replaces every song except the Danger theme with Kirby-series BGM.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Puyo Puyo</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Puyo Puyo is an arcade puzzle game featuring characters from Compile's Madou Monogatari RPG franchise. It is often referred to as first game of the Puyo Puyo series, despite the fact that an earlier Puyo Puyo title exists. The game was developed by Compile and published by Sega on their Mega Drive-based System C2 hardware. As opposed to its predecessor, the arcade Puyo Puyo places a heavy emphasis on competitive play; the game's single player mode consist of a 13-match gauntlet against various Madou Monogatari enemies, while the multiplayer mode pits two players against each other in a 2-out-of-3 Puyo match.The arcade version was ported to a variety of platforms. Three of these home ports would be extensively modified for worldwide release: the Genesis and Game Gear ports became Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, while the SNES port (Super Puyo Puyo) became Kirby's Avalanche.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player fighting DracoPuyo Puyo is a puzzle game with two players, although one may be controlled by the computer. Pieces come down in pairs, sometimes of different colors. When players connect at least four pieces, they "pop" those pieces, making them disappear. Two pieces are "connected" when they touch horizontally or vertically but not diagonally. Pieces that were above the popped pieces then fall down to fill the void created. The falling pieces can then create a connection of four similar colored pieces, thus causing a chain.When the player successfully pops pieces, they send "garbage" pieces are the opposing player, falling from random columns. The more pieces in a pop and the longer the chain, the more pieces are sent. These garbage pieces are uncolored and do not chain but if they are adjacent (again, vertically or horizontally but not diagonally) to a popped colored piece, then they also disappear.The player that hits the top of the well loses.Game ModesPuyo Puyo is split into two modes:Single Puyo PuyoIn the game's single player mode, the player assumes the role of Arle Nadja, a sorceress who takes pleasure in ruining Satan's plans. There are three difficulty levels: "Beginner" gives the player three easy opponents unrelated to the main game, "Normal" starts the player at Stage 1 (vs. Draco Centauros), while "Difficult" starts the player at Stage 4 (vs. Harpy). There are 13 stages in the normal game, the last of which is a battle against Satan himself.Double Puyo PuyoThis is basically multiplayer mode. In it two players play against each other. By out-chaining the other player, the player fills out his grid and that leads to victory.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]ProtagonistsArle Nadja: The protagonist. She sets it as her goal to defeat Satan, after he tries to steal her beloved pet Carbuncle, which she loves more than anything. She is a sorceress that can cast Ice, Lightning and Fire.Carbuncle: Arle's beloved pet, the one Satan attempts to steal.Beginner OpponentsSkeleton T: A skeleton that loves drinking herbal tea.Nasu Grave: An eggplant that wears square glasses. He jumps up and down most of the time, as he is too slow to runMummy: An Egyptian mummy who walks around wrapped in bandagesNormal / Difficult OpponentsDraco Centauros: A half-human, half-dragon girl who can manipulate fire.Suketoudara: A fish with muscular human arms and legs.Sukiyapodes: A one-legged, baby-faced monster.Harpy: An angel-like girl that sings out-of-tune, high-pitched songs.Sasoriman: A guard disguised as a scorpion.Panotty: A flute-playing sprite who becomes enraged when Arle doesn't dance to his song.Zombie: A zombie put together by spare parts.Witch: A witch who is prone to random giggles.Zoh Daimaoh: A raging Indian elephant whose Puyo causes the screen to shake.Schezo Wegey: A dark wizard whose desire for Arle's power is comically misconstrued.Minotauros: A minotaur who serves Rulue.Rulue: A female martial artist who is madly in love with Satan. As she was not faced in combat in the original versions of Madou Monogatari, she does not have a voice clip to introduce herself with.Satan: The final boss; a horned demon man who wants to be Arle's fiance.[CR]English Localizations[CR]"Silvana" vs. "Goby Captain" in the English version of unknown origin.An English-translated version of the arcade release was released in Europe, but the authenticity of this version is disputed; it is not known whether the game was officially localized by Compile/Sega or if it is an unlicensed bootleg. In addition to adding English voice work (and removing the wings from Harpy's sprites), this version changes almost all of the character names. One specific name change, Satan to "Dark Prince," is also used in the English versions of the Neo Geo Pocket Color Puyo Pop and GBA Puyo Pop.Though the Game Gear port was not released outside of Japan, playing the game in a non-Japanese system will reveal an English version named "Puzlow Kids." Notably, the ending text of Puzlow Kids's scenario mode is identical to the script of the English arcade release; this includes a mention of "the Dark Prince." However, Puyo were renamed to "P-Kids" in this version, while they are known as "PuyoPuyo" in the English arcade game.Sega and Nintendo published their own localized versions of Puyo Puyo, though they both stripped the Madou Madogatari characters from the game and used their well-known franchises instead. Sega used characters from The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon to create Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, while Nintendo and HAL Laboratory used Kirby characters to make Kirby's Avalanche. Mean Bean Machine drops the difficulty level system (and the beginner characters with it), but includes a password feature; the game also reuses several Puyo Puyo BGM tracks, such as Satan's theme becoming the Verses Mode and Danger themes. Kirby's Avalanche does not make any gameplay changes but replaces every song except the Danger theme with Kirby-series BGM.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Puzznic is a puzzle game that was originally released for Arcade by Taito in 1989. It is similar to Taito's earlier game Flipull/Plotting and involves carefully matching gems of the same color to remove them from the board until it has been completely cleared.Puzznic would be ported to a large number of home computers and consoles both in and outside of Japan shortly after its initial release.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The player has to manage gem blocks which fall to the bottom of the screen when unsupported. Gems disappear when one or more gems of the same color are touching them; however, if a single gem of a specific color is left behind, the puzzle becomes impossible to complete. The same is true when two or more gems cannot reach each other due to obstructions.In this sense, the game is deeply strategic in the same manner as a game like Sokoban where the player always needs to consider their next few moves.

				<plot>The year is 1944, and the landings in Normandy have begun, turning the tide of World War II. A German pilot named Michael Ilgner accidentally steers his plane into a mysterious vortex during the battle. He is then transported to the magical parallel world of Quintia, where he is requested by humans and other peaceful races to use the powers of his aircraft to defeat horrifying monsters that were unleashed upon the world.Quintia Road is an anime-style fantasy adventure game. The gameplay is quite straightforward, requiring minimal input from the player and offering no puzzles or other challenges. The player is normally expected to repeatedly select various verb commands (such as "Look", "Talk", etc.) from a text menu. There are no objects lists to combine these commands with. Story advancement is linear and only a few instances offer traveling choices. There are a few scripted turn-based battles in the game, which allow the player to select various types of attacks; however, these battles evolve in a prescribed fashion and the player's choices have little to no impact on the results. The game contains scenes with nudity and explicit sexual situations.</plot>

				<title_clean>R-Type</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]R-Type is a classic side scrolling shoot-em up game produced by Irem Corp. The game was first released to Japanese arcades in July 1987. The player controls a spacecraft and is tasked with defending humanity against the alien life forms known as Bydo. R-Type is infamously known for its extreme difficulty.R-Type was originally released in the Arcades and became a major early hit for Irem. It was eventually ported to many home computers and consoles of the era, with the unusual exception of the NES (a bootleg Chinese cart exists, however). The PC Engine of R-Type was split across two releases, but the US TG-16 version manages to fit the whole game onto one HuCard. This TG16 version is also the one that was added to the Wii's Virtual Console in 2006.R-Type also saw multiple sequels and spin-offs, as well as inspiring many future horizontal-scrolling shoot 'em ups.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Set in the 22nd century, the game takes place in the Bydo Empire. The player must make their way through the 8 merciless levels and defend mankind from the evil attackers. Bydo Dobkeratops - Boss of the first levelThe Bydo are biologically engineered weapons created by mankind to be used against their enemies in their quest for universal domination. This plan backfired however and the Bydo began to attack their creators.   The Ship The player pilots a ship called the R-9a "Arrowhead". The ship is named for its distinctive shape and is the 9th model of the R series of star fighter. The ForceThe R-9a "Arrowhead" can be equipped with an indestructible living weapon called "The Force". The force, a spherical pod that can be attached to the ship, is made of Bydo flesh and can absorb energy in order to increase in power. To obtain the force, the player must obtain a weapon power up. The force will appear behind the players ship and they can obtain the force by flying into it. The force acts as the ship's weapon system and will fire in the whatever direction it is facing. The force also acts as a shield and can be used to block incoming enemy attacks. The force has three levels of power. Collecting weapon power ups increases the power level of the force. The forces visual appearance changes as it increases in power.Red - A powerful counter-air laser beam that fires horizontally.Blue - Three thin laser beams. One forward firing and two that fire at a 45 degree angle from the front of the ship These beams rebound off walls.Yellow - Two flame beams that fire above and below the ship. These flames can travel along the ground or walls to destroy enemies.The force can be controlled by the user by using the force button. By pressing the force button, the user can attach the force to the front or the rear of the ship. They can also propel the force forward to execute an attack called the "force ram". Wave CannonThe R9-a is equipped with a beam weapon called the wave cannon. Holding the fire button will charge up the wave cannon and increase its power. Wave Cannon     [CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>The Return of Ishtar</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]The Return of Ishtar, also known as Ishtar no Fukkatsu, is a two-player action-RPG that follows directly after Namco's Tower of Druaga. Ki and Gilgamesh must escape the Tower of Druaga, fighting through the legions of Druaga that are trying to avenge their fallen master.One player controls Ki and the other controls Gilgamesh. Ki will instantly die if an enemy touches her but she has a ranged attack to keep opponents at bay, while Gilgamesh defeats any enemy he touches. However, Gilgamesh will die if he is forced to take on too many enemies on his own. The aim is to combine efforts to fight through enemies and explore each of the tower's rooms for valuable items.The Return of Ishtar was originally released for the Arcade in 1986. It would be later ported to the Sharp X68000, MSX, FM-7 and PC-8801. It would not see a US release until its inclusion in the PS1 Namco compilation Namco Museum Vol. 4 in 1997. The Arcade version was added to the Japanese Wii's Virtual Console library in 2009.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Rising Sun</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Lords of the Rising Sun (simply Rising Sun in Japan) is a strategy game with action mini-games. It follows the same blueprint of Cinemaware's earlier Defender of the Crown, transplanted to a historical Japanese setting. Originally released in 1989 for the Commodore Amiga, it was adapted to be one of the earliest CD-based games, released on the CD-i and TurboGrafx-CD.The game is set during the Genpei War, where the rival Taika (Heike) and Minamoto (Genji) samurai clans fought for power in the Imperial Court. The player can choose to fight as Yoshitsune Minamoto, Yoritomo Minamoto or Kiroyomi Taira.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>A young woman named Saori is returning home late in the evening. Sex-related events seem to pursue her, from the word "sex" written on the wall in the public toilet to a couple having sex on a bench in the park. Shortly afterwards, Saori is abducted by a sadistic woman who locks her in a mysterious mansion. By visiting the rooms within, Saori unlocks erotic memories of its inhabitants, ultimately exposing them to the owner's cruel pleasures.Saori consists almost entirely out of explicit sex scenes, ranging from its milder varieties to incest and torture. Unlike in most Japanese adult games, there is no censorship of private body parts in this game. The player's interaction is confined to repeatedly selecting context-specific options until the next event is triggered. In the beginning of the game the player only has access to one room. Repeatedly visiting rooms triggers new scenes and eventually unlocks other rooms.</plot>

				<plot>Scorpius is a horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player can choose to control one of the three available spaceships on their way through exotic planets populated by hostile alien races. The ships vary in shape and use modified versions of basic weapon types. Each ship starts with a low-damage gun and can upgrade and change the weapon to spreading fire, slow but powerful lightning attack, and others. The ships are also equipped with a claw-like tail, which is activated with a separate button. The tail can attack enemies in a circular motions and retracts back to the ship. Most stages require alternating between firearms and the tail for successful completion.</plot>

				<title_clean>Shanghai</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Shanghai is a board game where the goal is to remove tiles from the board by selecting pairs of currently "free" tiles, defined as any tile with a side free (other than the front) that can be removed from the table without disturbing its neighboring tiles. If the player is able to remove every tile on the board without getting stymied by locked tiles, they win the game. Though circles, bamboos, characters and dragons must be removed in identical pairs, a flower can be paired off with any other flower and the same is also the case for seasons. This is because there is only one flower/season tile each.Shanghai is frequently mistaken for the game of Mahjong, which is considerably more in-depth and plays more like the card game Rummy. Since Shanghai uses the same tileset as Mahjong and it is a one-player game, it is often called Mahjong Solitaire.This particular version was created in the late-80s and ported to various systems courtesy of Activision. Sunsoft is credited as responsible for the Famicom version, which was only available in Japan.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Shangrlia</title_clean>
				<plot>Tooru has always been a rather ordinary young man living in modern-day Japan. One day he was taking a stroll with his girlfriend and the two followed a strange cat to a mysterious castle. There, they met an old man who said he was Fermata, the court magician of the Kingdom of Nyuckel located in a parallel dimension where magic dominates over technology. A great war is taking place there. Erion, prince of Nyuckel, was cursed, and his soul transmigrated into Tooru's body. Taking the role of the prince, Tooru must command ten female officers and their armies and repel the invaders.Shangrlia (sic) is a turn-based tactical game. The ten female commanders reside in the castle and can be approached in any order. Each of them transfers the player to a different location (alternating between urban, dungeon-like, and rural areas) where a tactical battle takes place. Every commander is responsible for a unit type in the army. These types include Lancers, Fighters, Swordsmen, Cannoneers, Horsemen, Archers, Mages, Ninjas, Dragon Riders, and Birds. Enemy forces possess the same unit types. Each type has advantages and disadvantages in terms of power, mobility, range, etc. The goal is to select and position units on the battle field, taking the conditions of the terrain, number of enemies, distance, etc. into consideration. Defending own castle and capturing that of the enemy is the top priority.The battles then proceed in a turn-based fashion. Some unit types can attack from a distance, while others are restricted to fighting on adjacent squares. Battles are displayed as animated sequences on a separate screen, their outcome calculated according to the unit's properties and parameters. After each round of victory, the female general removes an item of her clothing. The final result for each general is an erotic picture with partial nudity and implicit sexual scene, but no explicit images.</plot>

				<title_clean>Shangrlia 2</title_clean>
				<plot>For a while peace was reigning in the magical Kingdom of Hyunckel. However, dark forces have emerged again. Commanding hellish creatures, they managed to capture the top female generals of the Hyunckel army, sealing them in special devices resembling eggs. Only three generals remained free, and they must liberate their companions and re-capture the land.Shangrlia 2 is a turn-based tactical game and a sequel to Shangrlia. The goal of the game is to capture castles occupied by the enemy, freeing commanders on the way. Unlike in the first game, the player is no longer allowed to choose any battle right from the beginning and is at first restricted to only three battles. Same applies to characters and unit types: in the beginning the player can only control three types of fighters, and other characters are unlocked gradually.There are fifteen unit types altogether (as opposed to ten in the previous game). New units include different types of horsemen, chariots, winged horses, golem commanders, etc. In addition, each unit comes in three variations, e.g. catapults and cannons are considered the same type, variants of which can be unlocked by completing battles and freeing them. Each unit gradually advances in strength, and must reach a "master" level to be actively selected by the player and positioned on the battle. This time, enemy units are mostly completely different and mainly consist of various monster types such as skeletons, minotaurs, dragons, undead mages, assorted hell creatures etc.Winning battles gradually unlocks erotic pictures of the female generals. The sexual content is noticeably heavier than in the first game and includes non-traditional types of sex as well.</plot>

				<plot>One puck, and only two competitors. One is the computer, and the other is, of course, you. You get a chance to match your skills at this Air Hockey style game, over 'Cantina Band' inspired music. Deflect the puck around the walled area using your bat, trying to knock it into your opponent's goal.There are several competitors, from which some of them definitely cheat, so be prepared to be laughed at. However, you can cheat as well, as you can resize your stick to fill the whole table width, or add one in the middle, and see who breaks glass first. There are single plays or the tournament where you play opponents in order of difficulty. The winner is the one who reaches 15 glassbreaks first.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]An example of a city.SimCity is a city-building simulation game released in 1989 and designed by eventual Sims creator Will Wright. SimCity, being Maxis' first game and originally based on the Commodore 64, has been adapted to several different personal computers and game consoles and has gone on to become one of the most successful and popular games of all time.Until the release of The Sims in 2000, the entire SimCity franchise was the most successful gaming franchise Maxis had created. Due to the immense popularity of SimCity, Maxis went on to create a multitude of other, similar simulation games, including SimTown and SimAnt., though none of these franchises has ever met the success of SimCity.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Sandbox vs. ScenarioAs would later to go on to define games of the SimCity franchise, the game first opens with the option of either building a city from the ground up (Sandbox) or running a city that is currently facing some issue or crisis (Scenario). In Sandbox mode, players choose a city site by choosing from a large list of premade maps and then giving a name to their city. Additionally, the Sandbox mode has no predefined goal or metric for "winning" the game, so players are free to run their cities as they see fit. Conversely, Scenarios have clearly defined metrics for winning (ex. double population in X years) and can be "lost".[CR]Versions[CR]SimCity was developed for a wide range of platforms and has seen multiple re-releases, each with their own changes and additions.iPhoneAn iPhone version of SimCity is available now, but it isn't this version of the game. The iPhone version is a remake of Simcity 3000, with some added features (such as better advisers).SNESThe Super Nintendo version exhibited changes made by Nintendo, such as the addition of Bowser, and the character "Dr. Wright" who guides the player.SimCity EnhancedWhile the game play remained identical to the original PC release the CD-Rom enhanced edition featured Live Actors, Digitized Voice and Sound, and  Full Motion Video.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]An example of a city.SimCity is a city-building simulation game released in 1989 and designed by eventual Sims creator Will Wright. SimCity, being Maxis' first game and originally based on the Commodore 64, has been adapted to several different personal computers and game consoles and has gone on to become one of the most successful and popular games of all time.Until the release of The Sims in 2000, the entire SimCity franchise was the most successful gaming franchise Maxis had created. Due to the immense popularity of SimCity, Maxis went on to create a multitude of other, similar simulation games, including SimTown and SimAnt., though none of these franchises has ever met the success of SimCity.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Sandbox vs. ScenarioAs would later to go on to define games of the SimCity franchise, the game first opens with the option of either building a city from the ground up (Sandbox) or running a city that is currently facing some issue or crisis (Scenario). In Sandbox mode, players choose a city site by choosing from a large list of premade maps and then giving a name to their city. Additionally, the Sandbox mode has no predefined goal or metric for "winning" the game, so players are free to run their cities as they see fit. Conversely, Scenarios have clearly defined metrics for winning (ex. double population in X years) and can be "lost".[CR]Versions[CR]SimCity was developed for a wide range of platforms and has seen multiple re-releases, each with their own changes and additions.iPhoneAn iPhone version of SimCity is available now, but it isn't this version of the game.

This is an add-on to the original 1989's SimCity which did not offer such a feature.</plot>

				<title_clean>Soft de Hard na Monogatari</title_clean>
				<plot>Soft de Hard na Monogatari is the third entry in System Sacom's Novel Ware series. The story has humorous overtones and deals with production of computer games. The protagonist is the son of a software company manager and has to fill in as a temporary leader when his father falls sick and is hospitalized. Himself an avid gamer, the young boss has to use his employee's strengths and his own imagination to produce a successful game such as the "Nobara Series" DAME (an obvious parody of DOME).Gameplay-wise, the game abandons the adventure format with its set verb-object commands and interaction with the environment, and plays more like a visual novel with light simulation elements. The player has to make choices for the protagonist, which will advance in-game time and ultimately influence the outcome of the story. It is possible to talk to the employees, check out planned software releases, and make other decisions crucial for the company and the hero's success.</plot>

				<plot>Hiroshi Saijo has done the impossible: when his father fell ill, he managed his software company with success. Now his father is the boss again, Hiroshi can relax and focus on his college studies and dating plans. However, he is still very much needed at the office, and matters become even more complicated when the new receptionist Rie Ishida arrives at the workplace.Like its predecessor, Soft de Hard na Monogatari 2 is essentially a visual novel. Simulation elements have been reduced, and interaction mostly confined to decisions the player is prompted to make for the protagonist, which may affect further events and branch the storyline.</plot>

				<plot>Sotsugy&#333; Shashin / Miki consists of two Japanese-style adventure games that were not released separately before. Both focus on the theme of high-school romance.In Sotsugy&#333; Shashin, the player takes control of a male high-school student. Unable to form a solid plan for his future studies, he is more interested in romantic relationship, and attempts to make things right with his schoolmate Hiromi Kamura before the graduation ceremony takes place.In Miki, the protagonist is Shinji Fujisawa, who attends the high school of the peaceful mountain village Tsubana. During a kagura dance performance, a time slip occurs, and he and his schoolmate Ayumi are miraculously transported to the feudal Edo era. Shinji's soul enters the body of the young blacksmith apprentice Shingo Benibana, and he attempts to change the tragic events of the past involving Shingo's love to the beautiful Miki.Both games play like traditional Japanese-style adventures, with menu commands for interaction with the environment and navigation. Whereas Sotsugy&#333; Shashin allows combinations of verbs with objects (e.g. "examine the room"), Miki is more streamlined and consists of simple context-specific commands only.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]"Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, get ready!"Space Harrier (&#12473;&#12506;&#12540;&#12473;&#12495;&#12522;&#12450;&#12540; Sup&#275;su Hari&#257;) is a third-person rail shooter game. It was developed by Sega AM2 and created by legendary developer, Yu Suzuki, responsible for many popular Sega games. The game was published by Sega and originally released in the arcades in October 1985. Since then, the game has been released on a number of platforms and spawned many sequels.Using Sega's Super Scaler 16-bit graphics technology, the game produced pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates, with the ability to scale as many as 32,000 sprites and fill a moving landscape with them, along with 6144 colors on screen out of a 98,304 color palette (15-bit RGB high color depth with shadow &amp; highlight).It also introduced a true analog flight stick for movement, with the ability to register movement in any direction as well as measure the degree of push, which could move the player character at different speeds depending on how far the stick is pushed in a certain direction. It also introduced a motion-based, hydraulic cockpit arcade cabinet, which moved in the direction the player moved the joystick. The game was also an early example of a third-person shooter; it was influenced by the earlier 1982 Sega game Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom, and Space Harrier in turn influenced later 3D shooters such as Nintendo's Star Fox (Starwing) in 1993.Running on the Sega Space Harrier arcade system board previously used by Hang-On, the pseudo-3D sprite/tile scaling in the game was handled in a similar manner to textures in later texture-mapped polygonal 3D games of the 1990s. Yu Suzuki stated that his "designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from Hang-On. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D."[1] The game's success established Suzuki as the leading arcade game designer at the time.[2]Space Harrier later saw ports to many home game systems.Space Harrier's release on the Sega Master System home console is particularly notable, as there were two versions: one was a port of the arcade game, while the other, entitled Space Harrier 3-D (1988), supported the SegaScope stereoscopic 3D glasses. The game also spawned the sequel Space Harrier II (1988) and the spin-off Planet Harriers (2000).[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The bonus stage.The game takes place in a unique place called the "Fantasy Zone" (no deeper plot is associated with Space Harrier). The Fantasy zone is a place filled with many strange creatures like one-eyed mammoths, alien pods, strange looking dragons, robots and flying mushrooms etc. The main character is a man with a giant gun/rocket that allows him to fly around. He runs along in a pseudo 3D level blasting anything that comes at him.The game has the player moving forward at all times and many enemies will get in the player's way, blasting projectiles and moving along in a certain pattern. The player must also do his or her best to move out of harm's way while shooting at anything that's presented on screen. Most objects are destructible, but some are not. If the player gets hit once, he or she will lose a life. The player starts off with two lives, and an extra life can be gained if the player racks up 5,000,000 points.The arcade version.The points will gradually increase as the player keeps moving. More points will be given for every thing that is destroyed by the player.There are eighteen stages in the game and a boss fight is presented in the end of sixteen of the stages. Two of the stages, stage 5 and stage 12, are bonus levels. The main character will jump on a dragon-like creature and destroy as many objects - trees, stone poles and bushes - as he or she can.StagesThe third stage, Amar.Stage 1: MootStage 2: GeezaStage 3: AmarStage 4: CiecielStage 5: Bonus StageStage 6: OlisisStage 7: LucasiaStage 8: IdaStage 9: ReviStage 10: MiniaStage 11: ParmsStage 12: Bonus StageStage 13: DrailStage 14: AsuteStage 15: VicelStage 16: NaturaStage 17: NarkStage 18: Absymbel[CR]Arcade cabinets[CR]There were several different arcade cabinets. The first two were the standard upright and sit-down cabinets, which introduced the use of an analog flight stick that, for the first time, detected movement in 360 directions as well as the degree of push. The first port to feature similar analog stick controls was the version that appeared in Shenmue for the Dreamcast in 1999.The third was a new type of deluxe cabinet: the "rolling" cabinet. The "rolling" type moved the entire cabinet in the direction the player moved the analog flight stick, left/right and forward/backward, simulating flight movement for the first time in an arcade cabinet. The first port to simulate the rolling type deluxe arcade cabinet was Space Harrier 3D, which utilized the Nintendo 3DS's gyroscope motion sensor, in 2012.[CR]Sega Space Harrier arcade hardware[CR]The arcade hardware used to run the game is widely known as the Sega Space Harrier system, or less commonly known as the Sega Hang-On system. It utilized two boards: the CPU (Central Processing Unit) mother board, and the Super Scaler graphics board which handled the game's complex sprite-scaling. The game displayed 128 sprites per frame, at 60 frames per second, scaling 7680 sprites per second. The graphics board itself is capable of scaling up to 32,000 sprites per second with more memory, as was the case with later Super Scaler titles.Technical specificationsCPU (Central Processing Unit) mother boardMain CPU processors: 2x Motorola MC 68000 (16/32-bit) @ 10 MHz each Performance: 3.5 MIPS (Million Instructions Per Second)Additional CPU: Intel 8751 (8-bit) @ 8 MHzSound CPU: Zilog Z80 (8-bit) @ 4 MHz Performance: 580,000 IPS (Instructions Per Second)Stereo sound chips FM (Frequency Modulation) synthesis chip: Yamaha YM2203 @ 4 MHz Channels: 3 FM channels, 3 SSG (Software-controlled Sound Generator) channelsPCM (Pulse-Code Modulation) chip: SegaPCM @ 8 MHz Channels: 16 PCM 8-bit channels @ 31.25 KHz sampling rateRAM (Random Access Memory) Program RAM: 32 KBAudio RAM: 2 KBROM (Read-Only Memory) Program EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM) memory: 448 KBAudio EPROM: 192 KBAudio ROM for PCM audio samples: Up to 16 MBSuper Scaler GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) boardGPU: Sega Super Scaler 171-5320 graphics card Sega 315-5011 sprite line comparitorSega 315-5012 sprite generator2x Sega 315-5049 tilemap chipsSega PAL chipset: 2x Sega 315-5107 horizontal timing controlSega 315-5108 vertical timing controlSega 315-5122 timing chipDisplay resolution: 320 x 224 pixelsColours on screen: 6,144Colour palette: 32,768 (15-bit colour)Frame rate: 60 frames per secondSprites displayed per frame: 128Sprites displayed per second: 7680Sprites scaled per second: Up to 32,000Hardware layers: 2 tile layers1 text layer1 sprite layer with hardware sprite zooming1 road layerTranslucent shadowsVRAM (Video RAM) memory: 192 KB high-speed SRAM (Static RAM)Graphics EPROM: 1152 KB[CR]Console ports[CR]The game was ported to several Sega consoles, such as the Sega 32X, and Sega Saturn. It also found its way to numerous computers and consoles of its era, often with various compromises in quality. The 32X version is one of the earliest ports to match quality with the arcade game, though even it cuts a couple of corners here and there. The Saturn version, released in Japan as "Sega Ages: Space Harrier" is also a pretty faithful version of the game. This version of the game also appeared in the US with two other games on a compilation disc simply called Sega Ages.The two Master System versions, including Space Harrier 3-D, reduced the graphical quality and speed quite a bit, but still managed to be a recognizable port of the original game. The first Master System version, released in 1986, was the first home video game cartridge to feature 2 Megabits (256 Kilobytes) of memory. The second Master System version, Space Harrier 3-D, featured the use of stereoscopic 3D graphics. The Master System versions also contain a new final boss fight against two glowing dragon creatures known as "Haya Oh." This new boss fight also appears in the X68000 version of the game. The Game Gear version of the game shares some of the basic quality issues as the Master System release, but contains different levels, an adjusted resolution, and a password system for continuing from later levels.Space Harrier, featured in Shenmue.The game was also featured in the game Shenmue. Space Harrier was located in the "You Arcade" building in the Dobuita area of the game; the player has to pay one-hundred yen to play the game. The "Sega Saturn" version of Space Harrier was also featured as a prize in the raffle in some of the convenience stores. The Sega Saturn version can be played on Ryo's Sega Saturn that is located in his living room.A polygonal remake of the game was made as part of Sega's Sega Ages series in Japan. The polygonal version of Space Harrier was released outside of Japan in the form of Sega Classics Collection.[CR][B]Reception:[/B][CR]Arcade versionThe arcade game was well received upon release. It became one of 1986's chart hits in the arcades. Computer and Video Games magazine reviewed the arcade game in its March 1986 issue, after reviewer Clare Edgeley played it at the 1986 ATEI (Amusement Trades Exhibition International) show in London, along with the arcade version of Super Mario Bros. She stated, "Perhaps the games to steal the show were" Space Harrier along with Shrike Avenger (1986), praising their hydraulic cockpit cabinets that "twist, turn and move" in the same direction as the joystick, making them "the most realistic" simulators "to date". She praised Space Harrier's "excellent graphics" for being "all in 3D with amazing technicolour landscapes" and a "multitude of objects" on screen, as well as "the sounds of the battle" output by "large speakers" where "you could almost lose touch with reality". She also praised the gameplay for being "exciting" and "very fast" paced, as well as the continue feature, but stated the game can be "very difficult."Clare Edgeley gave the arcade game a retrospective review in the February 1987 issue of Sinclair User, where she noted it had one of the first hydraulic arcade cabinets she had seen, along with 1986's Shrike Avenger. She stated that Space Harrier's "fabulously colourful 3D graphics" and "the movement of the sit-in cabinet were, and still are, breathtaking", noting "the seat-belt" and "turbulent" ride which "hurls you up, down, left and right" and tilts "the cabinet in a roll in whatever direction you push your joystick", concluding the game to be "great fun."Home conversionsReview scoresPublicationScoreComputer and Video Games70% (C64)68% (ZX)40% (CPC)[3]CRASH77% (ZX)Famitsu34/40 (3DS)Sinclair User (ZX)Your Sinclair9/10 (ZX)The Milwaukee Journal9/10 (SMS)AwardsEntityAwardGolden Joystick AwardsGame of the Year (Runner&#8209;Up)The home conversions were also well received. The game was runner-up in the category of Game of the Year at the 1986 Golden Joystick Awards.The Milwaukee Journal in May 1987 gave the Master System version a positive review, rating it a score of 9 out of 10. The reviewer Edward J. Semrad described the Master System version of Space Harrier as "the latest innovation" and "the most powerful cartridge ever made for any computer or game system." He concluded it "sets new standards in audio, graphic detail, memory and price ($40 list)."The September 1988 issue of Computer Gaming World (page 50) called Space Harrier "the best arcade shoot-'em-up of the year ... as exciting a game as this reviewer has ever played".[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The flying furry creature in the bonus stages is very similar to Falkor, the flying dog-dragon from the 1984 film, The NeverEnding Story.The game was originally supposed to be set in a real world military setting as players controlled a Harrier jet fighter. Due to the technical limitation at the offset of development of not having enough memory for all the intended graphics the decision was made to switch the game to a science fiction setting. The game however did retain the "Harrier" portion of its name though. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>The Princess Blue was a trading vessel. While cruising through space, it happened upon a derelict ship floating in space. Only one crew member was allowed to investigate the abandoned ship. Suddenly, Manchi raiders appeared on the viewscreen. The Manchi managed to ambush and destroy the Princess Blue. The only surviving crew member from the Princess Blue swears revenge and is determined to do everything in his power to defeat the Manchi.Space Rogue is a hybrid game that combines space flight and combat simulation with trading and RPG elements such as interaction with characters and a quest-based structure with a main plot line. Space flight takes place in two different modes: Cruise Flight, which is ideal for travelling quickly, and Newtonian Flight, which works best for combat and precision flying. There are also three different camera views for the 3D exploration and combat. Each planetary system has a variety of destinations and obstacles to travel through via a top-down navigational map. Traveling to an outpost, a space station, or any other location with the star system can be done simply by selecting it and charting a course, or in real-time 3D flight mode.Interstellar travel between systems, is done by finding a Malir Gate and using it to reach hyperspace. While in hyperspace, the game becomes a simple 'tunnel' game where the player must manually control the ship not to hit any of the walls. Also hyperspace travel eats away at the ship, so the faster the player can get through them, the more armor the ship retains. While traveling in space the ship may get attacked, or the player may opt to assault any other ships first. It is also possible to buy and sell various goods, earning money and spending it on outfitting the ship with weapons and various upgrades, such as for example a device that allows it to move more stealthily through space and avoid detection by hostiles. The player character has a reputation rating with various factions such as the Imperium, the pirates, and others. This rating is affected by the player's actions towards them and can be raised or lowered by helping specific factions fight others. When docked at outposts or stations, the view shifts to top-down, and the player navigates the protagonist through the location in an adventure or RPG-like fashion, examining objects and talking to characters. Conversations may have multiple choices, and a few instances require the player to type in keywords, though for the most parts responses are selected from a menu. The game has a main plot line that requires finding, talking, and performing tasks for characters, as well as sub-quests that may result in various rewards such as money or ship upgrades.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Arsys Software released Star Cruiser (&#12473;&#12479;&#12540;&#12463;&#12523;&#12540;&#12470;&#12540;) for the NEC PC-88, NEC PC-98 and Sharp X1 computers in 1988. Building on its 1986 spiritual predecessor Wibarm, Star Cruiser was an ambitious and innovative game years ahead of its time.The game's innovations included fully polygonal 3D graphics (including nearly all objects, enemies, and backgrounds, with the exception of distant horizons that were pre-rendered), true first-person shooter gameplay (anticipating the likes of Wolfenstein 3D and Doom), gameplay mechanics such as strafing, fusion of the first-person shooter and RPG genres (anticipating the likes of System Shock and Deus Ex), 3D open-world sandbox exploration across a large game universe (spanning several star systems) with six degrees of freedom, 3D space flight simulator gameplay for exploring (and fighting enemy spacecraft in) outer space, a crosshair to target enemies (both on ground and in space), and a portable computer built into the player character's power suit that has various uses (such as displaying an automap and radar).The game also emphasized storytelling, with an epic sci-fi space opera storyline set in the 27th century, various plot twists, extensive character dialogues with NPCs (who have their own background stories), anime style dialogue portraits for characters, visual novel style POV cutscenes, animated cutscenes rendered using the game's 3D engine, and a chiptune soundtrack composed by Toshiya Yamanaka (later released as a seperate original soundtrack CD) using FM synthesis.The game had a large open-world game universe, allowing the player to explore over 30 planets across four star systems. This makes it the earliest example of a fully 3D open-world game.[CR][B]Controls:[/B][CR]The original computer versions, the Sharp X68000 version in particular, used a unique dual control scheme that anticipated the standard keyboard &amp; mouse controls of the first-person shooter genre, with the direction keys used to move and strafe, while the numpad keys are used to turn around and aim (much like the function of the mouse in later FPS games). However, it is not possible to aim up or down while on foot (much like Doom), but in the outer space segments, the player can aim in all directions with the numpad keys.[CR][B]Plot:[/B][CR]In the 25th century, an inter-galactic war, which began when Earth made first contact with aliens, came to an end with Central Earth emerging the victor. 200 years have since passed. Now in the 27th century, the remains of the Earth Federation is known as the Federation Patrol, which has maintained a fragile balance of power with VOID, a nation under military rule demanding the deportation of the aliens. However, this fragile balance is being jeopardized by VOID's suspicious movements hinting towards a massive strike, with wars igniting across the galaxy.On Ganymede, a moon orbiting the planet Jupiter, a small batallion is dragged into the conflict and are being trained to fight back VOID. The story begins with the protagonist Brian in a tough training simulation, set up by his friend and comrade, Gibson, and his trusted droid, Freddy. After completing the simulation, they leave the main building and head to the restaurant, where they are given details on what is happening. There they are told that VOID has a base nearby that acts as one of their important strongholds and it is launching out threatening enemies, and Brian is asked to lead a "kamikaze attack" against it.[CR]Awards[CR]Star Cruiser won the following awards from leading Japanese computer publications at the time:POPCOM - Game of the Year (1988)Oh!X - Game of the Year (1988)[CR][B]Releases:[/B][CR]The game was ported to the Sharp X68000 computer in 1989. This version is considered the best version of the game, as it took advantage of the powerful X68000's hardware to add a higher display resolution, more detailed character portraits, and the most technically sophisticated 3D polygon graphics seen on a home gaming system of the 1980s.The version best known outside of Japan is the the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis) console version ported by NCS in 1990. However, it was never officially released outside of Japan. However, it was possible to play imported Japanese copies, particularly in the United Kingdom where import copies of the Mega Drive port were available by early 1991.Namco was planning to localize the game for the Sega Genesis console in North America under the title Star Quest. The October 1993 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly previewed an early English translation of the game, referring to it as an action RPG that is "light years ahead of the usual games." They noted that "Players have been on the lookout for Star Quest for a long time" and that it "was well worth the wait."The June 1994 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewed a fully translated English localization by Namco, stating that it was set to be released in the United States in July 1994. A European release was also planned for 1994. However, its release in the Western world was later cancelled.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]The game had a sequel, Star Cruiser II: The Odysseus Project, which was released in 1992 for the PC-9821 and FM Towns computers. In addition to the default first-person shooter combat of the original, the sequel also features an option for menu-based combat.Among later 3D Japanese computer games it influenced, the 1994 release Geograph Seal for the Sharp X68000 appears to have been influenced by the 3D graphics engine of Star Cruiser. In turn, Geograph Seal was the predecessor of Jumping Flash, the first true 3D platformer.Star Cruiser was also an influence on the famous game designer Hideki Kamiya (known for Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Viewtiful Joe, Okami, Bayonetta, Wonderful 101, etc.). In his blog, Kamiya mentioned Star Cruiser as one of his favourite games. [CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Star Luster</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A typical end of game screen, which uses a very Star Raiders-like ranking system.Star Luster is a space sim/shoot-em-up for the Nintendo Famicom (and much later, the Sharp X68000) that uses the Star Raiders model of having everything viewed first-person from the cockpit, and having to manually select which region of space to visit next and travel there by hyperspace. The goal is to intercept the "E"s on the starmap, which stands for "Enemies". The player can also visit friendly space stations (represented as "B"s, for "Base") to refuel and repair damage. The player can also opt to use one of their limited torpedoes to target an enemy region remotely, though this tactic must be used sparingly.In combat, the player must roll, pitch and yaw their craft to center the enemies on their screen before shooting them down. The player's map changes to a radar in order to help them search for enemies easier. Enemy attacks can also damage the player's ship, but they have to break through a regenerating shield before any permanent damage can be done. It is possible for the player to lose access to their radar and other computer systems after receiving heavy damage, in which case they must return to a base for repairs before they can be used again.Unlike Namco's previous games for the system, which were ports of the company's Arcade hits, Star Luster was the first to be created specifically for the Famicom. It was released into arcades via Nintendo's NES-to-Arcade "Versus System." This version was released slightly later the same year (1985) with a graphically-enhanced Sharp X68000 version released almost a decade later in 1994.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Star Mobile is a real-time puzzle game. A large scale is displayed on the screen, and stars continuously fall on it from above. The goal is to move the stars horizontally as they are falling in such a way that the weight on the scale is balance. Each stage contains a set amount of stars required for the player to handle. Stars come in different colors that represent their weight. Both right and left side of the scale contain several spots where the stars can land. If there are too many stars on the same spot, they will fall down, greatly decreasing the weight on the side they were in.</plot>

				<title_clean>Street Fighter II' Champion Edition</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Street Fighter II': Champion Edition is a 2D fighting game developed and distributed by Capcom for arcades (running CPS-1 hardware) in March 1992.The first derivative (hence the "dash" in the title) of Street Fighter II, Street Fighter II': Champion Edition tweaked various gameplay elements (changing the speed, damage, priority, and other characteristics of normal and special moves) while allowing players to pick the same character (each player character sporting a different color scheme) and making the four boss characters (Balrog, Vega, Sagat, and M. Bison) playable.In the early '90s, the game received main ports for three platforms: the TurboGrafx-16 (released by NEC Interchannel on June 12, 1993, originally exclusive to Japan), the Genesis (released on September 27, 1993) and the Sharp X68000 (released November 26, 1993, exclusive to Japan). The Genesis version (released as Street Fighter II': Special Champion Edition in North America and Europe and as Street Fighter II' Plus: Champion Edition in Japan) is unique, as it also includes some of the updated content from the SNES version of Street Fighter II Turbo (which also has a Champion Edition mode). The TurboGrafx-16 version was digitally re-released worldwide for the Wii Virtual Console on November 16, 2009 (the Japanese version released by Hudson). An obscure port of the game was released for the Sega Master System by Tec Toy in 1997 (for Brazil only).The game was also ported to the PlayStation in a compilation including World Warrior and Hyper Fighting, released in October 31, 1998 (in North America as Street Fighter Collection 2), December 3, 1998 (in Japan as Capcom Generations 5), and May 1999 (in Europe, published by Virgin, same name as NA). This port includes a Versus and Training Mode, optional arranged soundtracks, and a "Super Vs. Mode" (which allows players to fight with different character versions, later expanded on in Hyper Street Fighter II: The Anniversary Edition). This version was also used in the Saturn release (released in Japan only at the same release date), the Capcom Classics Collection compilation (released on September 27, 2005 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox), and the Capcom Classics Collection Reloaded compilation (released on October 24, 2006 for the PlayStation Portable).[CR]Special Champion Edition[CR]Special Champion Edition was the console version of both Champion Edition and Street Fighter II: Hyper Fighting for the Sega Genesis, it had the following features.ArcadeKen Masters beats up a car.Titled simply Game Start in the in-game menu, arcade mode allows the player to choose from one of the 12 available characters to do battle against and AI opponent. The player would face all of the normal characters in random order followed by the boss characters, also in random order save for M. Bison who is always last. At set intervals during the arcade mode the player would be given a specific task to accomplish against the clock. These included destroying a car, a pile of bricks, and falling barrels.V.S. BattleV.S. Battle the player versus player mode.Group BattleThe Group Battle character select screen.Group battle is also a player versus player mode further broken into two separate variants.Match PlayIn match play both players first choose up to six characters to use. The players then fight with their selected characters in order until one side has been completely wiped out.EliminationElimination is identical to match play save for each player gets to choose how many characters they wish to use.HyperHyper offers all the same modes and options and the standard Champion option except the player gets to choose the hyper level for the game. The hyper level, 0 through 9, increases the speed of the game. Zero hyper being normal speed and nine being somewhere in the vicinity of 5 times speed. Also when in hyper mode the characters default to their alternate color scheme.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Strider Hiryuu</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Strider HiryuStrider was released in Arcades in 1989, and for the Sega Genesis later on 1990. It was ported to a number of other systems, but these versions are considered far below the arcade and Genesis editions. At the time, Strider seemed like one of the games that made the Genesis so unique, a home experience only to be later surpassed by Sonic the Hedgehog. Strider was one of Capcom's very first big Arcade hits, preceding Street Fighter II. The game was popular because the action was fast, furious, and original. The story sequences in Strider are also notable, as they had voiceovers in eight different languages.Starring Strider Hiryu, the game is based on the 1988 manga, called Strider Hiryu.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Yes, I do.In the year 2048, the world has been devastated by the Grandmaster Meio, an evil man who had watched the Earth from a distant nebula before taking over. He now rules the world with an iron fist from his space station, the Third Moon. On a distant island known as Moralos, the striders, the last defenders of the Earth are training to defeat Meio. Strider, the youngest and strongest of these warriors, is the man who takes up the task.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]This looks unsafe.Strider is a side-scrolling action game, with platforming elements throughout. The player controls Strider Hiryu, who can perform acrobatic jumps, climb up walls, and hang from ceilings. Strider must use his skill set to overcome a variety of obstacles, and progress through the game's five stages. Each stage is littered with enemies looking to stop Strider in his tracks, and Strider has brought along his massive blade to deal with them. The game is relatively simple, using only two buttons along with the directional pad, one button to jump, and one to attack. Most enemies go down in only a few hits, the bosses on each stage being the only exceptions. Strider will have to avoid getting hurt by enemies, as he only begins with three life. He can gain more by collecting life tokens when he has full health.There are a number of powerups scattered throughout the game, which have a variety of effects. The most basic powerup extends the length of Hiryu's sword. Another powerup will make Hiryu invulnerable for a brief period of time. Some of the more important bonuses include the robots which come to Hiryu's aid. The first of these robots is the Dipodal Saucer, who charges into Strider's enemies. Second is the Terapodal RoboPanther, a large cat robot who follows Hiryu and attacks any enemy in sight. The final upgrade is the Robot Hawk, which, once again, damages any enemies it encounters.[CR][B]Trivia:[/B][CR]The soldiers in the background of the Genesis box cover are actually shamelessly copied from an earlier version of the Space Marine armor from the tabletop game Warhammer 40,000, complete with the distinct beaked helmet and bolter firearm for one, and the impractical studded shoulder pads for all of them.Prior to release, Strider was heavily hyped to be the first "8 MEG" (as in, 8 megabits) console game. The front of the box even states "8 MEGA MEMORY."[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Super D.P.S.</title_clean>
				<plot>Super D.P.S. is the fifth entry in the  D.P.S./Dream Program System series. Like the other D.P.S. games, it is a collection of three short scenarios, which are unrelated to each other story-wise and can be played separately. Those scenarios are presented as cartridges played on a fictional console named Dream Program System. Each scenario allows the player to choose between two different protagonists, or two different personalities for the protagonist. All of the scenarios feature nudity and/or sexual situations.The scenarios in this game include:A rather disturbing tale entitled Maria and Kanpan, which focuses on a young female robot specialist who falls asleep and is sexually "explored" by one of the robots. The player can view the events from either the girl's or the robot's point of view.An adventurous scenario, which depicts the dangers encountered by a young couple in a tropical forest populated by local tribes. The two are imprisoned and have to find a way to escape. The player can choose to control either the heroine or the hero.A scenario with sci-fi elements, involving a famous female space pirate named Camelia, who raids a space ship together with her pretty lieutenant. The story varies according to the player's choice to control Camelia herself, or a male soldier on the ship who captures Camelia's lieutenant.The gameplay is the same as in other D.P.S. games. At almost every screen, the player is given a number of choices, which correspond to answers or actions, according to the situation. Some choices are required to trigger the next event and advance in the game, others are "neutral", having no effect on the progress, while a few are considered "bad" by the game, leading to Game Over. Scenes, dialogue choices, and story events may vary slightly or significantly, depending on the choice of character in the beginning of a scenario.</plot>

				<plot>Super Daisenryaku is one of the many titles in SystemSoft's long-running war strategy series. The game mechanics are based on Daisenryaku II, but many of the included maps are unique to this release, including several based on Phantasy Star in Sega's console version. There is no campaign mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players. The computer versions also feature an editor.The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which consists of one of the included  terrain types. Each player controls a number of units (bought with money), which each take up one space on the grid. The unit types are for the most part based on real-life military equipment from around the time the game was released, what is available to the player depends on the chosen faction. The choices range from single nations, such as China or the USA (the CD port by Microcabin in particular adds a lot of smaller ones, like Sweden and Libya),  to alliances and blocs, for example NATO, which uses a mixture of equipment of it's members. Different units have different strengths and weaknesses, which affect their performance in combat and their general role on the battlefield. The cheap infantry units for example are not very strong and mobile, but may capture facilities and cities, unlike battle tanks. Terrain also affects the outcome of battles. The goal of each game is to capture the other players' capitals.</plot>

Different versions of the game have up to eight different tile sets, twelve patterns based on the animals of the Chinese zodiac, and a layout editor for creating patterns.In addition to the standard mode, the game also features "Dragon's Eye", a two-player Shanghai variant.  Players take turns adding and removing tiles from a small field with one player attempting to remove all the tiles and the other trying to position tiles to make this impossible.</plot>

				<plot>Super Real Mahjong PII &amp; PIII is a compilation that contains Super Real Mahjong PII and Super Real Mahjong PIII, which were only released in the arcades as separate games. Both games are fairly straightforward one-on-one mahjong matches; the player can not select the opponent and the game is over when one round of mahjong is lost.  The compilation features improved graphics and animation, as well as additional gameplay modes: four-player mahjong (in the computer versions) and versus mode, where the player can select opponents (in the PC Engine / TurboGrafx CD version).</plot>

				<title_clean>Super Real Mahjong PIV</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Super Real Mahjong PIV is a mahjong game developed by Affect for multiple consoles and Japanese computers. It is the sixth game in SETA Corporation's Super Real Mahjong title, but the fourth proper game in the series, hence the IV numeral. It features three female anime characters that the player can play one-on-one mahjong against.The Arcade and computer versions (FM Towns, NEC PC-9801, Sharp X68000 and Windows) have some amount of cartoon nudity. Most of the console versions (PC Engine CD, 3DO and Super Famicom) censor/remove these scenes.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Sweet Angel</title_clean>
				<plot>The player takes the role of Seisa, a bald-headed photographer. He likes sneaking into a high school and taking pictures of pretty girls. But one day he was caught and beaten by a girl who didn't want to be photographed. So Seisa plotted an elaborate revenge scheme: he managed to learn a spell that allowed him to look like different girls. Naturally, being one of the girls, it becomes much easier for our heroes to earn their trust - and to seduce them!Sweet Angel differs from the majority of Japanese adventures by allowing the player to physically move in the game world (from top-down perspective). Most important conversations and seduction scenes are still viewed from the traditional first-person perspective, with menu choices for different actions.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Syvalion is a Taito shoot 'em up that bucks trends by removing the forced scrolling and allowing the player to move in any direction at any pace they wish. The protagonist is a golden metallic dragon with several trailing segments that can breathe fire in eight directions to destroy enemies - the trailing segments make it vulnerable, so the player needs to keep moving to stay out of harm.The game was originally released in Arcades in 1988. It was later ported to the Sharp X68000 in 1990 and the SNES in Japan and Europe in 1992/93 - an American SNES version was planned but cancelled. In 2006, Syvalion was eventually re-released for the PlayStation 2 as a part of Taito Legends 2, which made it available to US audiences for the first time.Darius Burst, from Taito's acclaimed Darius series, features a boss will multiple forms. One of the forms greatly resembles the metal dragon of this game.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Taik&#333; Risshiden is an open-ended strategy RPG set in Sengoku-period Japan, where the player takes the role of a subordinate of warlord Oda Nobunaga named T&#333;kichir&#333; Kinoshita. The player chooses one of several possible professions, rolls their attributes, and must become successful in their chosen life.Each month, the player receives orders from Nobunaga, and depending on the player's performance, their status will rise or fall. Success will allow the player to rise in rank and status, while failure will see the player's influence diminish, and possibly even result in execution. Depending on the player's actions, the scenario may stick closely to historical fact, or diverge wildly.The player can travel to various locations via the overworld map, and depending upon their play style, several different modes of play may open up. The player can choose to engage their enemies in turn-based tactical battles, or foster peace through diplomacy. It is also possible to go gambling, date women, and even assassinate enemy (or friendly) characters. However, all actions will have an impact on the player's reputation.</plot>

				<title_clean>Tenka Touitsu</title_clean>
				<plot>Tenka T&#333;itsu is a strategy game set in feudal Japan, and and the first title in SystemSoft's long-running strategy series. Remarkably similar to the better-known Nobunaga's Ambition, Tenka T&#333;itsu casts the player as a daimyo during the Sengoku (Warring States) period in Japanese history, the campaign starting in 1551 with Oda Nobunaga's rise to power. The presentation is far more straightforward compared to Koei's game, and there is a focus on strategic use of a small number of units, much like a game of chess. The player may only control a dozen or so units at any given time, and can order them to advance, retreat, and attack as necessary.</plot>

				<title_clean>Tenshin Ranma</title_clean>
				<plot>Angels and demons have a disagreement concerning the human race. Some vote for its extermination; other suggest milder solutions. In the end, it is decided to test the humans' abilities. The Earth is invaded by hostile angels and demons of different kind. A boy named Takami is chosen to be the subject of the "examination". At the same time, a young woman named Yuima, discovering her celestial heritage and magical powers, decides to put an end to the invasion...The player can choose to begin the game as either Takami or Yuima. Takami is a fighter type with strong physical attacks; Yuima is a magic user. Their stories, however, converge early in the game, after which they fight together in a party. Tenshin Ranma is a traditional first-person 3D dungeon crawler. Enemies appear randomly and must be dealt with in turn-based fashion. Auto-map appears near the main exploration screen, highlighting already explored areas. Leveling up is automatic, like in most Japanese RPGs. Some dungeons have shops, where the heroes can buy weapons and items.There are scenes with nudity and eroticism, but no "hardcore" pornographic sex scenes.</plot>

				<title_clean>Tenshi-tachi no Gogo III Ribbon</title_clean>
				<plot>The third game in the  Tenshitachi no Gogo series is not connected to its predecessors story-wise. In this installment, the player assumes the role of a male teacher in a high school. Many pretty female students (and pretty female teachers) surround the hero, but he only has one girl in mind: Haru Okamoto, whom he calls "his angel". In order to win her love, the hero will have to know her better - which also means knowing the secrets of students and teachers alike...Tenshitachi no Gogo 3: Ribbon is a Japanese-style (puzzle-less) adventure game. The player interacts with the environment by choosing verb commands ("Look", "Ask", "Search", etc.), which lead to sub-menus with object choices. The game mostly advances in a linear way, but at certain points the story can end prematurely, depending on the player's choice.</plot>

				<title_clean>Tenshi-tachi no Gogo III Bangai-hen</title_clean>
				<plot>The second Bangai-hen (a side story) in the  Tenshitachi no Gogo series is set in the same environment and features recurrent characters from  Tenshitachi no Gogo 3: Ribbon. The protagonist is a high-school student, who also happens to be the brother of Haru Okamoto, the main love interest in Ribbon. Like in most other games in this series, the story revolves around the main character's effort to have sex with every female character, including school mates and colleagues in part-time jobs.The gameplay is identical to the one in Ribbon or in the  previous Bangai-hen: the player proceeds through still screens, typically depleting the available menu commands (verbs and object sub-menus) until a new command appears or an event is triggered. Like in most other games in the series, there are multiple dead ends and possible actions that lead to premature end of the game.</plot>

				<plot>The Catholic high school for girls, St. Sophia, has a reputation of a very traditional establishment with strict rules. However, there are also rumors that after midnight, something mysterious happens to the school, and everything inside it changes... When the protagonist, a substitute teacher, arrives at St. Sophia for a three months teaching job, he quickly discovers that the behavior of the school inhabitants is anything but compatible with the Christian morals...Tenshitachi no Gogo 4, like most other games in the  series, is a fresh start story-wise; from gameplay point of view, it plays just like its predecessors: it is a traditional Japanese adventure, without puzzles and with menu-based interactions, with verb commands and sub-menus of objects. Usually the game allows the player to advance only upon depletion of all the possible commands. There are, however, right and wrong decisions, including story branches that will end in a Game Over.</plot>

				<title_clean>Tenshi-tachi no Gogo VI My Fair Teacher</title_clean>
				<plot>In this installment of the  Tenshitachi no Gogo series, the player takes the role of Tatsuya Shindou, the new teacher in the girls-only Shirakaba High School. Following the tradition of the series (as well as many other  hentai games), the protagonist's only interest is in having sex with as many girls as possible, regardless of their age and social status, and even regardless of their consent...Tenshitachi no Gogo 6: My Fair Teacher plays similarly to the previous games in the series, having an extensive menu with verb commands that allows interaction with the environment. As before, the player usually has to deplete most of the available commands before triggering an event and moving to another screen. The interface looks slightly different, having general command groups "Look", "Speak", and "Action", with object menus and specific action commands accessed via sub-menus.Like the other Tenshitachi no Gogo games, this installment has explicit non-consensual sex scenes; in this game, there are also explicit depictions of sex with children.</plot>

				<title_clean>Tetris</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A screenshot from the 1986 MS-DOS version of Tetris.Tetris was originally created by Alexey Pajitnov, who designed and programmed the game in June 1985 while working in the USSR at the Dorodnicyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Science in Moscow. The name Tetris is a portmanteau of the Greek prefix "tetra", which means "four", and Pajitnov's favorite sport, tennis.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Tetris challenges the player's spatial relation abilities by presenting them with different shapes made of four square blocks. The blocks are presented one at a time at the top of a rectangular play field, and quickly begin descending toward the bottom. The player can rotate the shapes and move them horizontally as they descend, and if you are able to make a complete horizontal line of blocks, that line will clear from the field. In its original form, Tetris was an endurance test, as the speed of the descending shapes would constantly increase as time went on, and the game would end when the play field filled completely with blocks.[CR]Tetris Variants[CR]A number of Tetris variations, both official and otherwise, have been released over the years, including Hatris, Welltris, Super Tetris 2, Tetris Blast and Tetris Attack. Aside from spawning its own spin-offs, Tetris has been highly influential on a large number of puzzle games released in its wake.[CR]IP Rights[CR]The rights to Tetris have been greatly disputed over the years. At one point a British software house named Andromeda was going to purchase the rights, but before the deal with Pajitnov was settled, they sold the rights to Spectrum Holobyte. Even though Andromeda's original deal with Pajitnov fell through, Spectrum Holobyte released what was essentially an unlicensed version of Tetris. After that point the rights began bouncing around, with Atari, Nintendo, the Soviet government, and other entities claiming ownership at various points.[CR]Additional Information[CR]Tetris GiantTetris became even more popular when the game was packaged with the Nintendo Gameboy and helped sell millions of handheld systems.Sega also published a game known as Tetris Giant, the largest licensed Tetris arcade machine.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Thrice is a puzzle game similar to Columns. You drop blocks consisting of fruit symbols (such as pear, watermelon, plum, etc.) and must match three or more either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Unlike in Columns though, here you can't rotate the blocks normally; you must find where you would want a block to fall and once it touches a block, you can press right or left to make the column fall over.</plot>

				<title_clean>Thunder Blade</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Thunderblade is an Arcade game by Sega. The player takes control of a helicopter and destroys air and ground threats while avoiding buildings. It is one of the early games to make use of Sega's Super Scaler technology (along with Space Harrier, Hang-On, OutRun, and After Burner), which scaled sprites and allowed them to seem as if they were different distances away from the player, giving the game a pseudo-3D perspective. In the case of Thunder Blade, this made buildings to appear to have height and depth to them, as well as making it seem enemies were coming into view from below as the helicopter flies through the streets.The game intermittently switches from a vertical scrolling top-down perspective to that of a third-person "behind the helicopter" view in which it appears to travel forwards into the screen, on a Z-axis. Both viewpoints play the same: The player must use a mix of weaponry to attack both rival helicopters in the air and enemy tanks on the ground, all the while avoiding the nearby buildings.Arcade CabinetsThe original Arcade version was released for the Sega X Board hardware. The game came in two different cabinets. The standard upright cabinet featured, like Space Harrier and After Burner, an analog flight stick and force feedback.The other, more expensive, cabinet was the deluxe sit-down cabinet, where the player sits on a helicopter seat and the seat moves in sync with the chopper's movements, with the player controlling the motion of the seat. The monitor of the deluxe cabinet is decorated with various dials and graphics to simulate the look of a real helicopter cockpit.Console PortsThe game was a huge arcade hit and Sega would port the game to many consoles, including both of their own consoles, Master System and Mega Drive / Genesis, as well as many other systems. These versions generally weren't able to properly mimic the effects of the Super Scaler technology, however.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Thunder Force II</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Thunder Force II is a hybrid top down free roaming shooter and a side scrolling shooter packed into one game, referencing the first Thunder Force with the top down section and staying competitive with the new side scrolling levels. Players fly the FIRE-LEO02 Execliza, searching to destroys bases in the top down mode and then fly through the side scrolling sections in search of defeating ORN once and for all.[CR]Weapons and Powerups[CR]Thunder Force II has a diverse selection of weapons that can be chosen at any time as long as the ship is equipped with the weapon power up. Below is a list of all the weapons and a short description of their usefulness.WeaponsTwinA default weapon, twin shot is a basic, no frills weapon that deals moderate damage with limited range. Twin allows the ship to fire two machine guns at a withering rate. Since twin is one of the two weapons retained after a death, it is a key weapon in the game despite its mediocrity.BackThe second default weapon, back is basically twin with the exception that the ship can now fire forwards and backwards. As such, bullets stream from the front and back and can be very helpful in shaking a tailing foe off without having to meticulously fight off the opponent and putting the player's ship in danger.Wide (Top Down Only)A top down weapon only, wide replaces back when picked up and for good reason, as wide shots not just front and back but also from a 45 degree angle both ways from the front. Wide is good for confronting overall threats and is useful for keeping the tail clear from foes while dealing damage to units in front.Five (Top Down Only)This weapon feels quite like a spread cannon, covering a great area and dealing medium damage. This weapon can fill a majority of the screen and keep foes suppressed, but the only drawback is that it is hard to spot enemy bullets with all the firepower dished out.Des (Top Down Only)Primarily a ground attack, Des allows the ship to shoot at ground targets not just directly head on but at the two 45 degree angles, making this the perfect weapon for destroying bases and not putting the ship in front of danger. Des is effective against turrets since they shoot only in a certain pattern.Clash (Top Down Only)A weapon similar to the flamethrower from Contra, this weapon shoots swirls that constantly loop forward, destroying units in its path. This weapon is more powerful than most other weapons and could be used to clear the screen of enemies with proper directional input.HunterThe series' trademark weapon, the hunter shoots out energy balls that lock on to enemies and continues to follow them until they are destroyed. Hunter rounds shoot from the ship extremely fast, making this weapon the ultimate force in dealing with onscreen enemies. The only downside is that in top-down levels hunter rounds do not strike ground targets and can attack enemies that are invincible, allowing vulnerable enemies to slip by.Mega (Side View Only)The replacement to back, mega is a good offensive choice as it allows the ship to shoot three rounds forward and two rounds backwards, enabling good coverage of most angles during scrolling levels.Wave (Side View Only)A good early weapon, wave shots weave in and out of each other and can go through obstacles which make this weapon great for taking care of enemies further down the screen. Its oscillating pattern also can pick off units where other weapons cannot reach.Side (Side View Only)Extremely helpful in the later levels, side blaster lets the ship shoot directly above and below, great for eliminating turrets and falling enemies with ease. It can also be used to take out destructible flying obstacles without awkwardly positioning the ship at an angle that is disadvantageous.Nova (Side View Only)This weapon requires a bit of thought for proper use. It shoots rounds of energy in a spread formation, but will always shoot in the opposite direction from where the ship is heading. Therefore, to get this weapon firing forward, the ship must be "flying" backwards, or to shoot above, the ship must be flying downward. However, once this learning curve is established, this weapon can be used strike enemies from any angle.LaserThe strongest weapon in the game and the replacement to twin, laser first either a constant beam of energy in the top view mode, or four lasers in rhythm for the side view levels. Foes will melt at this weapon's great power and strength.PowerupsClawAn add-on for the ship, the claw is similar to the options from Gradius, rotating around the ship and firing forwards. The most valuable addition the claw brings is that the claw can absorb enemy bullets if it comes into contact with it. The ship is capable of having two claws attached to it, making death from bullet fire significantly decreased if managed well.RollRoll increases the speed at which the claws rotate around the ship. Bullets will have a much harder time penetrating through to the ship when roll is active. After a set time, the roll will cease and the claws will continue to roll at the original speed.BarrierLike Contra, barrier grants temporary invincibility for the ship.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Thunder Force II is a hybrid top down free roaming shooter and a side scrolling shooter packed into one game, referencing the first Thunder Force with the top down section and staying competitive with the new side scrolling levels. Players fly the FIRE-LEO02 Execliza, searching to destroys bases in the top down mode and then fly through the side scrolling sections in search of defeating ORN once and for all.[CR]Weapons and Powerups[CR]Thunder Force II has a diverse selection of weapons that can be chosen at any time as long as the ship is equipped with the weapon power up. Below is a list of all the weapons and a short description of their usefulness.WeaponsTwinA default weapon, twin shot is a basic, no frills weapon that deals moderate damage with limited range. Twin allows the ship to fire two machine guns at a withering rate. Since twin is one of the two weapons retained after a death, it is a key weapon in the game despite its mediocrity.BackThe second default weapon, back is basically twin with the exception that the ship can now fire forwards and backwards. As such, bullets stream from the front and back and can be very helpful in shaking a tailing foe off without having to meticulously fight off the opponent and putting the player's ship in danger.Wide (Top Down Only)A top down weapon only, wide replaces back when picked up and for good reason, as wide shots not just front and back but also from a 45 degree angle both ways from the front. Wide is good for confronting overall threats and is useful for keeping the tail clear from foes while dealing damage to units in front.Five (Top Down Only)This weapon feels quite like a spread cannon, covering a great area and dealing medium damage. This weapon can fill a majority of the screen and keep foes suppressed, but the only drawback is that it is hard to spot enemy bullets with all the firepower dished out.Des (Top Down Only)Primarily a ground attack, Des allows the ship to shoot at ground targets not just directly head on but at the two 45 degree angles, making this the perfect weapon for destroying bases and not putting the ship in front of danger. Des is effective against turrets since they shoot only in a certain pattern.Clash (Top Down Only)A weapon similar to the flamethrower from Contra, this weapon shoots swirls that constantly loop forward, destroying units in its path. This weapon is more powerful than most other weapons and could be used to clear the screen of enemies with proper directional input.HunterThe series' trademark weapon, the hunter shoots out energy balls that lock on to enemies and continues to follow them until they are destroyed. Hunter rounds shoot from the ship extremely fast, making this weapon the ultimate force in dealing with onscreen enemies. The only downside is that in top-down levels hunter rounds do not strike ground targets and can attack enemies that are invincible, allowing vulnerable enemies to slip by.Mega (Side View Only)The replacement to back, mega is a good offensive choice as it allows the ship to shoot three rounds forward and two rounds backwards, enabling good coverage of most angles during scrolling levels.Wave (Side View Only)A good early weapon, wave shots weave in and out of each other and can go through obstacles which make this weapon great for taking care of enemies further down the screen. Its oscillating pattern also can pick off units where other weapons cannot reach.Side (Side View Only)Extremely helpful in the later levels, side blaster lets the ship shoot directly above and below, great for eliminating turrets and falling enemies with ease. It can also be used to take out destructible flying obstacles without awkwardly positioning the ship at an angle that is disadvantageous.Nova (Side View Only)This weapon requires a bit of thought for proper use. It shoots rounds of energy in a spread formation, but will always shoot in the opposite direction from where the ship is heading. Therefore, to get this weapon firing forward, the ship must be "flying" backwards, or to shoot above, the ship must be flying downward. However, once this learning curve is established, this weapon can be used strike enemies from any angle.LaserThe strongest weapon in the game and the replacement to twin, laser first either a constant beam of energy in the top view mode, or four lasers in rhythm for the side view levels. Foes will melt at this weapon's great power and strength.PowerupsClawAn add-on for the ship, the claw is similar to the options from Gradius, rotating around the ship and firing forwards. The most valuable addition the claw brings is that the claw can absorb enemy bullets if it comes into contact with it. The ship is capable of having two claws attached to it, making death from bullet fire significantly decreased if managed well.RollRoll increases the speed at which the claws rotate around the ship. Bullets will have a much harder time penetrating through to the ship when roll is active. After a set time, the roll will cease and the claws will continue to roll at the original speed.BarrierLike Contra, barrier grants temporary invincibility for the ship.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>You play the role of a young boy named Custom. You've always liked fighting, but haven't quite found a way to develop your talents. One day, wandering through the country, you meet a beautiful girl named Kumiko, who tells you about the Battling Gods Championship in her town. The conditions sound good enough for Custom, but soon he realizes that he is too weak to participate, and has to descend into nearby dungeons to fight monsters and to become stronger, having more chances to win the big prize.T&#333;shin Toshi is an erotic anim&#233;-style RPG similar to  Rance series, and set in the same universe. Navigation in town and dialogues with characters are done from first-person view. In dungeons, the perspective switches to top-down. You explore the dungeons and fight randomly appearing enemies in turn-based combat. In the town, you can stay in the inn, buy supplies, or enter the tournament in the Colosseum.</plot>

				<title_clean>Twilight</title_clean>
				<plot>In Twilight, the protagonist, who works for a mysterious magic-using organization, is set to Transylvania, to investigate the murder of a nun known as Sister Christa. A woman named Karen, who also specializes in black arts, goes to the monastery with the hero, but obviously has her own agenda. The goal is to find out the truth by questioning the suspects, keeping an eye on one's own safety...In the beginning of the game, the player can choose any of the six possible scenarios, each dedicated to a different suspect (all female). They all take place in the same monastery, but dialogues, events, etc., are completely different. The interaction in Twilight is confined to periodical decision-making; many of the decisions are "wrong", leading to the hero's death or otherwise premature ending.Twilight is set in a dark, "gothic" world of a Transylvanian monastery. The game uses photo-realistic background images, with the traditional bright anime graphics for characters. The game features explicit sex scenes.</plot>

				<title_clean>Twilight Zone 4 - Tokubetsu-hen</title_clean>
				<plot>Aliens have invaded Earth. Seemingly impervious to damage, they took control of the planet. Only a few partisan organizations dared to oppose their rule. All the aliens look like young and attractive human women, and soon it was found out that they have a weakness to sperm. Thus, a young Japanese man and his few male allies embark on a quest to defeat the aliens by having sex with them.The fourth installment of the Twilight Zone series is not connected to its predecessors story-wise. Like the three previous games, it is an RPG where the enemies are exclusively semi-naked girls and most battle commands correspond to sexual actions. Unlike the preceding games, navigation is done in top-down view, though the battles remain first-person. Up to three characters will join the protagonist and take part in combat. There is no world map and the game is built in a fairly linear way, with only a few friendly areas where enemies do not appear.</plot>

				<title_clean>Twin Bee</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]TwinBee is a 1985 shoot 'em up that, after originally being released to arcade, was released on numerous platforms including the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the first game in the Twinbee series of games that includes both shoot 'em ups and platformers. It has been rereleased most recently as a "3D Classics" title for the Nintendo 3DS.TwinBee is a vertical scrolling shoot 'em up that is unlike any others during the time. Instead of "gritty" alien and military plane shooters, Konami decided to make a very cutesy shoot 'em up that retains all of the fun of others in its genre, but paints it with a thick coat of famed Japanese cuteness.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]TwinBee has fairly typically shoot 'em up gameplay. The player is in an anthropomorphic ship named Twinbee, scrollings upwards and shooting enemies. It is all in the visual design of the game that makes it different. The game has very bright colors and everything is designed in a very cartoony manner.Levels are structured in a standard shoot 'em up manner. The player flies through an area and at the end has to fight a larger boss ship.TwinBee features multiplayer co-op in which the second player commands a pink ship named Winbee.AbilitiesHealth: Twinbee can be hit up to two times. The first time he is hit he loses his wings, moves slower and can not use his ground attack.Aerial Attack: Mash the primary button and Twinbee will shoot pellets forward that will damage enemies. This is Twinbee's main weapon.Ground Attack: Perhaps the primary original feature to this game is the separation of aerial and ground attacks. Twinbee's primary attack only does damage to air. If he is being fired at by an enemy on the ground the player can toss a bomb towards the ground that will destroy whatever baddie is shooting from there. When Twinbee attacks the ground a crosshair shows up that shows where the attack will go. If Twinbee is within reasonable distance of an enemy then he will automatically aim for that enemy so that the player doesn't have to worry about perfectly aiming the ground atacks.CollectiblesThere are a number of collectibles in TwinBee that will either give the player points or power up Twinbee.Fruit and Pellets: Twinbee can collect both various kinds of fruit and pellets to simply give the player some extra points.Bells: Bells can be found by destroying enemies or shooting clouds. When a bell appears it floats towards the bottom of the screen and Twinbee can either collect it or shoot it to juggle it. Juggling the bell awards more points to the player once the bell is actually collected.Twinbee Orbs: These items that resemble a fatter version of Twinbee cause Twinbee to bloat then shoot out the orb a second later. The orb inflicts a large amount of damage on enemies.BellsThroughout TwinBee, while juggling the bells awards points, they can also be hit to change their color between a flashing red, pale blue, and white. Collecting these bells during this event causes different power-ups to be applied to the ship.Flashing Red: This power-up adds an extra two ships that follow Twinbee and fire an identical stream of bullets like the Original Twinbee.White: When collecting a white bell, the power-up changes Twinbee's weapon to a smaller white dot that builds every time Twinbee collects another White bell.Pale Blue: Pale Blue bell's enhances the ship's speed, stacking as more are collected. These are the most common bell.Enemy Bell: Sometimes the bell will turn into an enemy and the player needs to be careful when attempting to collect. Simply shooting this enemy once will destroy it and provide points.Be careful, hitting a bell too many times can destroy it and lose any points that could be earned.EnemiesTwinbee fights some ornery radishes.Throughout the game Twinbee fights a number of regular household objects including flying vegetables and flying kitchen utensils. The basic ground enemy resembles an animated pine cone. Twinbee has to fight boss enemies at the end of each level that often look more like a airplane/spaceship.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In the future, space travel has become an inseparable part of human civilization. Humanity spread all over the Milky Way. Most of the problems concerning war, ecological disasters, and others were successfully solved. Human beings have entered an era of peace. But human nature never changes, and most other aspects of human culture haven't either. Since the galaxy became a huge urban playground, a new type of criminals have emerged - interstellar thieves. Piloting their own space ship, they terrorize the galaxy with their cleverly planned tricks. Particularly notorious is a duo of two young and pretty girls, Sati and Shiori... which are the two protagonists of the game.Funny Bee has a few turn-based battle at pre-set points, during which the playable character executes various attack techniques; however, the system is too rudimentary to be considered a major part of gameplay. The rest of the game plays rather like an adventure in Japanese style. The player chooses menu commands, triggering events and advancing the story. There are also locations with an auto-map, for more convenient navigation (also menu-based). The game contains scenes with nudity.</plot>

				<title_clean>Ultima IV - Quest of the Avatar</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar is the fourth entry in Richard Garriott's long-running and influential Ultima series of role playing games. Released in 1985 for the Apple II and then for the Commodore 64 and the IBM PC, Ultima IV departed from the "kill the evil wizard" plot of the earlier games of the series and encouraged the player to complete the Quest of the Avatar by mastering eight virtues and finding the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]The basic gameplay in Ultima IV is not substantially different from Ultima III. However, Ultima IV introduces the concept of virtue as a foundation that governs the player's identity and progress. The player creates their protagonist at the start of the game by answering a series of questions about what he or she would do in a morally ambiguous situation. The player's answers determine which of the eight virtues he or she is most closely aligned to, and then the player begins the game with a character of the class which represents that virtue. The player's representative class and virtue also determine the city in which the player starts the game.There are eight virtues in the game, each represented by a class, a city, and a dungeon. The virtues themselves are built on the three principles of Truth, Love, and Courage. In each city, the player encounters a character of the class representative of the city's virtue, that under the right circumstances can join the player's party for a maximum total of eight party members.Inspiration for the eight virtues and three principles is found in a number of sources, including Buddhism and Hinduism, and as Richard Garriott himself said, the Wizard of Oz.The VirtuesVirtueFromCityDungeonClassHonestyTruthMoonglowDeceitMageCompassionLoveBritainDespiseBardValorCourageJhelomDestardFighterJusticeTruth and LoveYewWrongDruidSacrificeLove and CourageMinocCovetousTinkerHonorTruth and CourageTrinsicShamePaladinSpiritualityTruth, Love, and CourageSkara BraeHythlothRangerHumilityNoneNew MaginciaStygian AbyssShepherdConversationsThe conversation system is built on the foundation found in Ultima III, allowing the player to engage with NPCs with the key words "name", "job", and "health" and then by repeating phrases from the NPC's speech. In console versions of the game, text entry is replaced with a list of conversation topics that the player can choose from.CombatCombat is similar to Ultima III, but now spells require reageants which must be purchased (or found) and mixed in advance of combat. When the player enters a battle encounter, the player can choose to move party members individually one square per turn, cast magic, or attack from melee or long range (if the party members are appropriately equipped). There is also an "Auto" option that allows the computer to pick the action that the party member will take.ExplorationWhile exploring the overworld, the player has access to the moongates; magical gates that were introduced in Ultima III. The availability of these gates are dependent on the phases of the two moons, which determine which gates are currently open and their destinations. However, unlike Ultima III, the game does not feature an "underworld" like Ambrosia.Dungeon exploration in Ultima IV continues to use first-person, 3D hallways, but now also features rooms depicted from an overhead view as well.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]The player is tasked by Britannia's Lord British to become an Avatar by reaching enlightenment in each of the eight virtues. The player's standing in each of the virtues is determined by actions taken during gameplay. Positive influences include refraining from stealing (i.e.: Not opening treasure chests found in towns or castles), giving gold to beggars and blood (Hit Points) to healers, meditating, answering NPCs' questions properly, not fleeing from combat, and letting non-evil creatures encountered during combat flee.Once a player has reached the required level in a given virtue (the seer Hawkwind in Castle Britannia keeps the player appraised of his or her virtue) he or she must meditate at the shrine corresponding to the virtue. When the player has completed this task for all eight virtues, he or she is ready to take on the Abyss to find the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom.To accomplish this final task, the player must use eight colored stones (one found in each of the eight dungeons) to find the three parts of a key. Once the key is acquired, the player must then descend into the eight levels of the Abyss. Once the player has reached the bottom of the Abyss, he or she must answer a series of questions. If the player answers any of these questions incorrectly, the player character is warped back to the surface world and forced to navigate the Abyss again from the start. Should the player succeed and answer all of the questions correctly, he or she obtains the Codex of Ultimate Wisdom and becomes the Avatar.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Ultima IV created the foundation of the rest of the Ultima series. All of the subsequent games would take place in or in relation to the world of Britannia and would reinterpret the virtues and the basic structure of the world. In later games, Richard Garriott would relativize the "goody two-shoes" story of Ultima IV by showing the unintended consequences of this single-minded quest for goodness. The antagonist of Ultima V would impose a totalitarian regime based on the virtues. It would be revealed that by taking the Codex from the bottom of the Abyss, the Avatar set into motion the destruction of the Gargoyles' world, and that by becoming the Avatar he or she spawned an evil alter-ego, the Guardian.The story of Ultima IV is extremely open-ended. The moongates allow the player to access any area of the game from the beginning, and the virtues and dungeons can be tackled in any order, except for the game-ending Abyss. The open-ended nature of the game would give way to a more tightly scripted story in later games.[CR]NES Version[CR]A version of Ultima IV entitled Ultima: Quest of the Avatar was made for the NES. The game's graphics were completely redrawn in a style similar to that of Japanese RPGs of the era such as the Dragon Quest series, and certain gameplay systems were streamlined for better playability on a console, rather than a PC with a keyboard. Otherwise, the game's structure and content are largely identical to the PC version. This version of the game was developed by Japanese company Infinity, which would go on to adapt the first two Populous games for Super Famicom and the Sharp X68000, and was published by Pony Canyon.[CR]Availability[CR]As of September 2011, Ultima IV is available at Good Old Games. It has also been released as part of the "Ultima 4+5+6" package.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Ultima V - Warriors of Destiny</title_clean>
				<plot>Boxart showing an artpiece of the avatar.Ultima V, on the heels of the moral and technological breakthrough Ultima IV, has that King Arthur quality to it. It's been 2 years in your world(20 in Britannia) and someone named Blackthorn has usurped the throne after Lord British has disappeared. LB has been spotted at marshes some times although Blackthorn has persecuted any who say so as sacreligious. While LB was ruling the Avatar's eight virtues were expounded and practiced to make Britannia more wealthy, but now there are high taxes and martial law and Blackthorn has twisted the eight laws to form a police state. He even wants to figure out the mantras and the secrets to the Codex and the now sealed-off dungeons. Your object is to rid Britannia of the menace he and possible accomplices pose to Britannia.Iolo and Shamino realize the kingdom is trouble and call on the Avatar of legend to come back. He does, but as he is summoned through the magic moongate three Shadowlords appear and one throws a bolt into Shamino, who is left on the edge of death. The three heroes retreat to Iolo's hut deep in the woods, where they hope to let Shamino recuperate.Title screenYou'll need to get Lord British's artifacts, the Sandalwood Box, visit eight shrines and solve their quests (need to get the mantras too), get eight words of power to open the dungeon, and find Lord British. You begin as an avatar, but can lose the status by harming virtues. In the game this loss of Avatar status is shown by important clues being withheld. For example, in Britain, you won&#8217;t receive the password for opening the dungeon Despise if you haven't followed the path of the Avatar. The game now also has day and night cycles. In the night, the gates to most towns are closed and the people living there mostly lay in their beds although guards still patrol.OverworldUnderworldOne of the new improvements is the magic and combat system. In a combat situation you have a cursor which you can use to attack in any direction. That cursor will remain on the selected monster as long as you wish. That doesn&#8217;t mean combat is easy since you only get 30 hit-points, more when a new character level has been achieved, while monster magic capabilities and sheer numbers have increased. Magical spells are now (and in further Ultimas too) divided into 8 cycles. The higher the level of the spell caster, the more magic they can use.Great graphics for that time[CR]Availability[CR]The game is available at gog.com and is part of the "Ultima 4+5+6" package.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Ultima VI The False Prophet</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ultima VI: The False Prophet is the third game in the second trilogy of the Ultima series, and the sixth (or possibly seventh) title to be released in the series. Ultima VI is notable for its single-scale world, in which cities blend seamlessly into the overworld, its strong moral sense, and its unstructured, non-linear gameplay -- a harbinger of what would later be called sandbox games.The Ultima VI engine would see use in the Worlds of Ultima series, which took place outside the main Ultima universe.Ultima VI was the final Ultima to see release on a wide variety of personal computer platforms, ranging from the C64 to the Atari ST, to the Amiga, FM Towns, PC98, X68K, and the PC, and years later on the SNES. Ultima VI was the first Ultima game not available on the Apple II.[CR][B]Background:[/B][CR]In Ultima VI, as in the previous two Ultima games, the player assumes the role of the Avatar, the embodiment of virtue and hope for the lands of Britannia. The game begins with the Avatar on Earth, enjoying a computer game, when a moongate suddenly appears. They enter through it, only to find themselves in the middle of a ritual sacrifice conducted by the winged, demonic-looking race known as Gargoyles. Although the Avatar is bound to the altar, and all appears lost, their companions -- Iolo. Shamino, and Dupre -- appear and free him. They then find themselves back in Lord British's castle, where they discover that the shrines of the virtues are under attack by the Gargoyles. The Avatar is tasked with freeing the shrines and discovering the nature of the Gargoyle invasion.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Similarly to other Ultimas, they are free to build their character, via stat points, in any way they wish. The Avatar is capable of using all weapons and spells in the game; however by increasing either STR, DEX, or INT, either melee, ranged, or magic attacks will be increased in effectiveness.Like other games in the series, the Avatar gathers a party to fight alongside them. They start off with three members, Iolo the Bard, Shamino the Ranger, and Dupre the Knight, but they can take any number of different characters with them, each of which have their own stats and uses. While the Avatar is the main character of the game, it is possible to take control over individual characters at times (which can have strategic uses), although the player cannot talk to other NPCs unless they are controlling the Avatar.As a sandbox-style game, Ultima VI lets the player do things different ways. There is not set order to completing objectives or visiting dungeons. There are a number of optional areas to visit and weapons to obtain. It is easy to miss things unless they explore every area. There is no level gating -- the player can explore the entire world from the get go. Ultima VI has a handful of travel options -- in addition to running, the Avatar can buy a horse, a boat, or ride a raft.The Avatar can rob stores, steal from the bank, and kill NPCS. They can kill a farmer's cow for meat, or milk it for milk to churn into butter. Take flour, and bake bread with it. Buy a ship and explore, or kill the shipwright and steal all his deeds. Ultima VI had a large number of what would now be called crafting opportunities, in which the player can take items gathered from the world and combine them to create something new.Although the player has a great deal of freedom, Ultima VI has, in the background and hidden from the player, something called Karma. Stealing or unprovoked killing decrease karma, while doing certain missions increases it. It is not possible to complete the game if the player's karma is too low.[CR][B]Characters:[/B][CR]NameLocationSTRDEXINTMagicNotesBeh Lembefore Hythloth dunegon232426GargoyleBlainwith Gypsy band162118Gypsy jugglerGornunder Sutek's isleFighterGwennoMinoc1821179Bard, scholar and Iolo's wifeJaanaYewDruid and healerJuliaMinoc211817TinkererKatrinaNew Magincia191616ShepherdLeonnaMoonglow151518FighterLeodonMoonglow1519157FighterSeggallionSerpent's Hold282120Fighter.

				<plot>The game is based on the famous adult manga/anime series with the same name. It generally follows the main plot: the demon Amano Jaaku is banished from Makai (the demon world) to the Earth by the Elder, doomed to be trapped in a human body; he is given the mission of finding Choujin, the most powerful god, who is hiding in the body of a high-school student.Urotsukid&#333;ji  is a Japanese-style adventure. The interaction with the game world is performed by choosing verb commands from the menu ("Look", "Talk", etc.). Navigation is also done by choosing the command "Move" and then the name of the location. Most of the time it is necessary to visit all the locations and deplete menu choices in order to advance the story.</plot>

				<plot>Viewpoint is a top-down orthographic perspective game in the tradition of Zaxxon. The PlayStation and Saturn versions feature 3D rendered graphics with texture maps, unlike the other versions which primarily feature shaded polygons.One or two players (in hot-seat or cooperative mode) control a spaceship equipped with a laser cannon which can be charged (by holding the shooting button down) for a stronger blast. Besides the main weapon, three special weapons are available: a wall of fire which wipes the screen up in a wave, a nova-like blast and a circle of spherical-green homing missiles.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B]Winning Post is a Japan-only release that marked the beginning of Koei's long running Winning Post series. While initially only released for the Sharp X68000, it was later released on the Sega Mega-CD, 3DO, NEC PC-9801, Super Famicom and Game Boy Advance.The goal is to take a stable of horses, hire professional jockeys to ride them and raise money from winning and betting on races. Winning Post is a very dense management game, like much of Koei's early output.This is the Japan-only first title of the Winning Post series released in 1993. For the 1996 North American title of the same name, which was actually the second in the series, see Winning Post.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>God had created the world with Light and Shadow completing each other, maintaining the balance of events. The Tribe of Light are humans, living on the surface; the Tribe of Shadow has many different creatures, who dwell underground. To sustain peace and harmony between the tribes, a huge stone tablet called Words Worth was erected. But one day, someone has shattered the tablet. Both Tribes blamed each other and began a bloody war that has been raging for hundred years. Finally, the king of the Shadow Tribe sends his son, the brave Astral, to find out what really happened to the tablets, and to restore peace in the world.Words Worth is primarily a first-person dungeon crawler. Even though there are a few "friendly" areas, such as a town where the hero can rest and buy supplies, most of the game is spent in dungeon-like, maze-like areas (with an auto-map feature). There is no party in the game: Astral has to face the enemies alone. The enemies appear randomly, and the combat is turn-based. The game has scenes with nudity and sexual situations.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Part of the Worlds of Ultima spin-off series, The Savage Empire sees the Avatar transported through time after a failed experiment with Blackrock -- the substance that would form the basis of the plot in Ultima 7: The Black Gate. After ending up in the Valley of Eodon, the Avatar must fight off the invading Myrmidex, hunt dinosaurs, and unite warring tribes to save the world.Like the other Worlds of Ultima title, Martian Dreams, The Savage Empire uses the Ultima VI engine, and offers a high level of interactivity with the environment, as well as mouse-based movement and VGA graphics.[CR]SNES version[CR]The SNES version of Savage Empire was released in Japan in 1995, five years after the original PC release. This version used the Ultima VII SNES engine and has greatly simplified gameplay, with the player controlling only the Avatar with no accompanying party. The SNES port is quite rare and was never translated into English.[CR]Availability[CR]Beginning in 2012, gog.com began distributing The Savage Empire and its sequel Martian Dreams as free downloads.System Requirements[CR]PCOS: Windows XP / VistaCPU: 1.8 GHzRAM: 512MB (1 GB recommended)Graphics: 3D graphics card compatible with DirectX 7 (compatible with DirectX 9 recommended)Hard Drive: 2GBMacOS: OS X 10.6.8 or laterCPU: Intel Core Duo 2GHz+RAM: 1GBGraphics: 64MB of video memoryRecommended two-button mouse, or Apple mouse with Secondary Button / Secondary Click enabled.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Wrestle Angels 3</title_clean>
				<plot>Wrestle Angels 3 is, like its predecessors in the series, a turn-based wrestling-themed game. The player takes the role of the manager of a new company that represents and trains young wrestlers, guiding them to participate in an all-female league. Wrestlers can be selected and hired either directly by following the league's records, or by scouting the city and recruiting suitable candidates. Afterwards the wrestlers can be trained by choosing and investing points into particular moves. It is also possible to send them on vacations. Most actions in that preparation mode cost action points (AP); running out of them ends the turn.The manager can then send the wrestlers to participate in tournaments. The actual wrestling matches can be set in auto, with their outcome determined by the wrestlers' parameters. However, it is also possible to control them manually, choosing each move from a deck of randomly dealt cards. Moves include attacks, special attacks of various kinds, charging, healing, etc. There is also an exhibition mode where the player can select any of the 48 available wrestlers and take them to single or tag-team matches.</plot>

				<title_clean>Wrestle Angels Special - Mouhitori no Top Eventer</title_clean>
				<plot>Wrestle Angels Special follows the same gameplay template as its predecessors in the  series. Unlike in the previous games, however, the player creates two female wrestlers. After naming them, the player is taken to a character screen, which allows him to choose wrestling moves that will be used in the upcoming battles. After that, the tournament begins. As before, the wrestling matches are turn-based, both sides choosing a move from several available ones. It is also possible to set the matches on auto, letting the computer AI choose the moves, in case the player is sure the best moves were assigned before the match. There is also an exhibition mode, which allows the player to choose any wrestler and to have a single match against any other.</plot>

				<plot>Xenon 2: Megablast is a vertically scrolling space shooter, in which you have to pass several levels, filled with waves of enemies, that all end with a level boss creature. Each group of enemies you destroy grants you a cash reward and every once in a while you enter Colin's Bargain Basement, where you can use this cash to purchase upgrades for your ship like better weapons, speed &amp; health upgrades etc. Some upgrades can also be picked up during the levels.The first part of the game has an organic feel to it, while the second part of the game features mechanical enemies. As there are some maze-like sections with dead-ends in the game, your spaceship  scrolls backwards when you keep pressing the down key.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Xevious is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up developed by Namco and released in the Arcade in 1982. It is one of the first games of its genre, and contributed many things to that genre, including the concept of bosses. The game is known for having one continuous level, featuring forests, bases, temples, and waterways. Xevious was a huge cult hit in Japan, despite its limited popularity in the United States. The game was also considered to be the first Arcade game to have a television commercial aired for it in the United States.The player controls a Solvalou, a combat aircraft containing both a front-firing "shooter" for anti-air combat and a "bomber" for air-to-ground bombing runs. The game contains both enemy aircraft and enemy ground units, such as tanks and turrets. It is one of the first shoot-em-ups to include hidden bonuses, which could be uncovered by bombing particular areas in the game (these include the SOL towers, which takes one bomb to reveal and one to destroy, and special flags). It is also one of the first shoot-em-ups to include a boss, the massive flying fortress Andor Genesis.The game was also known for its glitches and Easter eggs. It's possible to see a short message showing the programmer's name by moving to the bottom-right of the screen, holding down the bomb button and destroying the first two enemies. Another rare Arcade glitch gave the player countless amounts of lives.Xevious was ported to many systems, including the NES, Atari 8-bit, Atari 7800, NEC PC-8801, NEC PC-9801, MSX, FM-7, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari ST, Apple II, Amstrad CPC, Sharp X1, and the Sharp X68000. The original Arcade game has been in many of Namco's compilations, including Namco Museum Volume 2 for the PlayStation, Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Gamecube, Namco Museum Remix for the Wii, Namco Museum DS for the Nintendo DS, Namco Museum Battle Collection for the PSP, and Namco Museum Essentials for the PlayStation Network (PS3). The game was released as a Xbox Live Arcade game on the Xbox Live Marketplace for 400 MSP ($5), which was later included in Namco Museum: Virtual Arcade for the Xbox 360. The game was also part of the Microsoft Revenge of Arcade compilation for the PC. The NES version of Xevious was also released for Game Boy Advance as part of the Classic NES Series.Xevious spawned a few obscure sequels. Super Xevious, released a year later on the arcades, was a harder version of the original with several new enemies. Solvalou, released in 1991 in Japan, is a version of Xevious shown from the first-person perspective. Xevious 3D/G, released in 1995 for arcades and the PlayStation, added 3D graphics while retaining the 2D viewpoint of the original. Xevious Arrangement was a special version of Xevious created for Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1. Xevious Resurrection is another special version of Xevious, but created for Namco Museum Essentials.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>In the far future, human beings learned to travel to faraway solar systems; as a result, human civilization has spread across the entire galaxy. However, as they tried to explore the outer space beyond it, they encountered a huge black hole. It was said that a strange light emanated from it. A brave scientist and pilot named Sonya traveled to the black hole, and discovered a medieval-like world, whose inhabitants consider her a divine savior...Despite the side-scrolling perspective for navigation, Yesterday is an RPG without any action elements, similar to its "sister games"  Caroll and  Emerald Densetsu. The player navigates the heroine through vast side-scrolling environment, fighting randomly appearing enemies. During the turn-based battles, the game switches to first-person view. Items and equipment can be bought in friendly areas. Leveling up is automatic; magic spells are learned depending on the protagonist's level.</plot>

				<plot>During the Third World War, human beings have employed complex biological weapons that involved artificial mutations of living creatures. The unforeseen result of this technique was the creation of horrifying monsters that soon began to fight for dominance of the entire planet. A special all-female team known as "ASSP", under the command of Reiko Kirihara, was assigned to battle the monsters. They are humanity's last hope...Y&#333;j&#363; Senki: A.D. 2048 is a simple turn-based strategy game. The player selects five team members for a mission; afterwards the girls are taken to a large battlefield. Navigating the girls on the field, the player can attack monsters when they are in range of the girls' weapons. There are no special attacks or any attack animations; however, the game will randomly display a sexual torture scene depicting a monster raping a girl during battles. Between the battles, the player can sometimes choose to chat with the girls, which occasionally leads to a sex scene.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ys III: Wanderers From Ys is the third entry in the Ys series. Taking place nearly three years after the events in Ys I &amp; II, Adol and his companion, Dogi, have been wandering the land. On their journey, the two had heard rumors regarding Dogi's hometown, Redmont, that prompted them to venture there. Dogi's hometown, located in the land of Felghana, had been experiencing crop failure as well as vicious nighttime attacks. Not afraid of the danger, Adol and Dogi set forth on their new adventure.Ys III, like its predecessors, was originally released on the NEC PC-8801 and its upgraded version PC-9801 in 1989. It was soon ported to other Japanese home computers, like the MSX and Sharp X68000. A couple of years later, it was ported to the SNES, Genesis and TurboGrafx-CD. These console ports all received English localizations.Ys III would be remade as Ys: The Oath in Felghana for the PC in 2005. It follows the same story, but uses the engine from Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim. Its PSP and 2012 Steam re-release versions were localized into English by XSEED.When released Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded scores of 7,8,7,8 saying, "...misses the high mark of the original. There is little or no challenge here and the whole quest is too straightforward for an adventure game".[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Ys III features several new additions to the Ys series, while also retaining several components. The most important change comes in the form of it's gameplay. No longer played from a top-down perspective, Ys III is played from a side-scrolling perspective not unlike another Falcom-developed title, Sorcerian. With a change in perspective also comes a change in game mechanics. Players now have direct control over Adol's ability to attack, either with ducking, forward, or overhead sword attacks, which is a major departure from the previous game. In Ys I &amp; II, players had to come in contact with enemies in order to damage them, as the majority of attacks were done automatically. Only in Ys II did players have a controllable attack in the form of a fireball. Another major change is the ability to jump. Since Ys III is also a platformer, the game has been given vertical depth, and as such, Adol needs the ability to jump to attack certain enemies and overcome obstacles. Yet another change to the gameplay system is the omission of magic points. Replaced by consumable rings, players can accrue a stock of them by defeating enemies, and subsequently use them to power the different permanent rings that Adol finds over the course of his adventure. Also of note, is that Ys III does not feature as much back-tracking as it's predecessors, and is much shorter in length because of it.As for the components that Ys III kept, the first would be the wearable rings. Found at various points in the game, Adol can obtain five different rings - power, shield, time, heal, and protection - that have the same properties as they did in the previous games. Adol must also buy or find the different swords, shields, and armors throughout the game, with five items per category just like the previous games. In addition to Adol's equipment, he must also find an array of items, keys, and objects to aid him in his journey and to open up new paths. Ys III also has an experience point system like the previous games, however, depending on the version played, the game will either feature diminishing experience points ( TGCD) or not ( SNES). Ys III also allows players to save at any time they wish, except during boss fights.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Described by its developers as a "New Type Role-Playing Game", Zavas differs from the Japanese-made RPGs by resembling a Western-style RPG, in particular the  Ultima games of its time. Retaining the characteristically Japanese manga/anime aesthetics in graphics, Zavas has little resemblance to Japanese RPGs in other aspects. It is not story- and character-driven; the player controls a knight named Mardy in the medieval fantasy land of Fargana (with slight Middle Eastern influences), and is free to go anywhere, exploring the world without following a set storyline. The top-down world consists of vast wilderness areas and towns. Similarity to Western RPGs is evident in detailed management of player-controlled party (NPCs with names and portraits, but little personality can be found and recruited). beside the usual weapon, armor, and item management, the player must also buy food to keep his characters alive. Some of the interaction with NPCs offers choices (for example, paying money or attacking a guard who demands toll to enter a city). The enemies appear randomly. The turn-based combat is very similar to that of Ultima games, with characters freely moving around a fixed battle screen.</plot>

				<plot>Kazumi Kinoshita and Sanae Kanazawa are two high school girls who go on a school trip together with their classmates. Shortly after their arrival at the camp dormitory, various girls become targeted by unknown assailants. In order to solve the mystery the two heroines must talk to their classmates, collect clues, and eventually find the culprits.Abunai Tengu Densetsu is an adventure game with menu-based navigation and input. Most screens offer a fairly long list of verb commands, some of which must be combined with objects or persons selected from a sub-menu in order to interact with the environment. The game allows the player to visit many different rooms and other locations in any order; however, certain events must be triggered in order to advance, sometimes by repeatedly selecting commands. Certain situations require the player to find items and use them in a different location. The game contains scenes with explicit nudity and sexual situations.</plot>

				<plot>The protagonist of Crescent Moon Girl is a cat who accidentally walks into a tent and triggers the appearance of a mysterious female magician and her strange assistant. They turn the cat into a young man and tell him that in order to become a cat again he has to find three particularly well-endowed young girls and bring them to the tent. The ex-feline begins his quest in a town containing many female inhabitants, with only a select few answering to the requirements that are his ticket back to his native shape.The gameplay follows a Japanese template, with menu-based navigation and interaction with the environment. Each location offers various verb commands (Look, Talk, Enter, Touch, etc.), most of which can (and should) be combined with objects or persons in a sub-menu. Conversation topics can be selected as well; in particular, it is possible to ask most female characters about their age, hobbies, three sizes, etc. The game has scenes with explicit nudity.</plot>

				<title_clean>D.P.S - Dream Program System</title_clean>
				<plot>D.P.S is a collection of three short scenarios, which are unrelated to each other story-wise and can be played separately. Those scenarios are presented as cartridges played on a fictional console named Dream Program System. Each scenario allows the player to choose between two different protagonists, or two different personalities for the protagonist. All of the scenarios feature nudity and/or sexual situations.The scenarios in this game include: A medieval fantasy tale entitled Princess Fantasy, in which the player controls a knight who accompanies a princess on a journey. Depending on the personality choice, the knight can either be brave and compassionate, or cynically take advantage of the helpless girl. A typical "naughty doctor" story, in which the player - as either male or female school doctor - has to "examine" young and pretty female patients, trying not to scare them away by employing too direct methods. An encounter between a famous female pop idol and her fan (also female), which leads to a bizarre sexual experience. The player can choose to control the events from the point of view of either the star or the fan.The gameplay is essentially that of a visual novel. At almost every screen, the player is given a number of choices, which correspond to answers or actions, according to the situation. Some choices are required to trigger the next event and advance in the game, others are "neutral", having no effect on the progress, while a few are considered "bad" by the game, leading to Game Over. Scenes, dialogue choices, and story events may vary slightly or significantly, depending on the choice of character in the beginning of a scenario.</plot>

The protagonist is a man who finds himself in a hotel when a fire starts. Trying to escape, he enters a room occupied by a prostitute. The following events evolve slightly differently, depending on the personality choice made by the player before the start of the game.A sequel to the second episode of the  first D.P.S. game. Once again, the player chooses either the male doctor Katsuki or the female doctor Katsumi whose goal is to seduce the patient, the cute school girl Yumiko.The gameplay is the same as in other D.P.S. games.

The two return home and prepare for the "big event" in the night. The player can choose to control either the husband or the wife.A story entitled Graduation, which begins with a rather standard premise of a shy high school boy trying to express his love to a pretty school mate. However, the events take an unexpected turn when a dragon appears and the girl is hurt. The player can determine the personality of the hero before the start of the episode.A bizarre fantasy tale with the title Rabbit P4P. The protagonist follows a mysterious "bunny girl" into a fairy tale-like realm, where he has to figure out what to do in order to win the graces of magical creatures, which look like young and pretty women. The personality choice influences the hero's attitude in this episode as well.The gameplay is the same as in other D.P.S. games. At almost every screen, the player is given a number of choices, which correspond to answers or actions, according to the situation. Some choices are required to trigger the next event and advance in the game, others are "neutral", having no effect on the progress, while a few are considered "bad" by the game, leading to Game Over. Scenes, dialogue choices, and story events may vary slightly or significantly, depending on the choice of character in the beginning of a scenario.</plot>

				<plot>Kazumi Kinoshita and Sanae Kanazawa are two high school girls who go on a school trip together with their classmates. Shortly after their arrival at the camp dormitory, various girls become targeted by unknown assailants. In order to solve the mystery the two heroines must talk to their classmates, collect clues, and eventually find the culprits.Abunai Tengu Densetsu is an adventure game with menu-based navigation and input. Most screens offer a fairly long list of verb commands, some of which must be combined with objects or persons selected from a sub-menu in order to interact with the environment. The game allows the player to visit many different rooms and other locations in any order; however, certain events must be triggered in order to advance, sometimes by repeatedly selecting commands. Certain situations require the player to find items and use them in a different location. The game contains scenes with explicit nudity and sexual situations.</plot>

				<plot>Two young warriors, Notos and Ing, were traveling in a faraway country, when suddenly a giant woman-snake appeared in front of them. Ing escaped, knowing that Notos was probably killed by the monsters. Tortured by his conscience, Ing is found by a local young girl named Luna. But soon Luna and other young village girls mysteriously disappear, and Ing decides to help them however he can - not forgetting his quest for revenge against the snake...Despite this RPG-like plot, the game is strictly a Japanese-style adventure. At every given screen, there are the standard Look, Talk, and Think commands. It is typically required to go through all the commands multiple times, obtaining the "Move" command and advancing the story.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Bomberman is a maze-based arcade game, developed by Hudson Soft. The first in the Bomberman series, it unfortunately didn't contain any multiplayer. At the time it was well-received and today it is considered as a genre-defining video game. There has since been countless iterations on its blueprint and huge multiplayer communities around them.[CR][B]Story:[/B][CR]Bomberman is a robot working at a bomb factory who gets bored of making bombs. He hears a rumor that anyone that makes it out from the underground factory gets a wish. Bomberman, desperate to escape, sets out on a journey to the surface. The only thing standing in his way is the factory security guards who will do anything to stop him. Spoiler alert: Bomberman will turn into Runner when he reaches the surface.[CR]Other Versions[CR]The Famicom version differed slightly from the MSX original, so the Famicom version was ported back to the MSX under the title "Bomber Man Special".European versions were released under the names "Eric and the Floaters" (MSX/Spectrum) and Dyna Blaster (Amiga, Atari ST, and PC)[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Break Down</title_clean>
				<plot>Break Down is a variant of the "concentration" memory game. The player is presented with a screen covered by face-down cards, and has to click on them one at a time, matching two identically-looking ones to make them disappear. Each wrong move removes a life from the player character. Cards that can be matched are portraits of young women; other cards include Life Up (grants an additional life), Death (instant loss of life), and Shuffle (re-arranges all the cards). The player must complete a set amount of correct match-ups in a round before running out of lives. Doing that leads to a picture of a young girl who gradually undresses as the player wins more rounds. It is possible to play against four girls to view different pictures, but the gameplay and the cards are identical for all of them.</plot>

				<plot>Cho Ren Sha 68k (Ultra Fire 68K) is a top-down vertically scrolling D&#333;jinshi shoot 'em up. It was originally released in 1995 and later it was ported to PC. It is a shooter with classic mechanics modeled after the Toaplan games. There is one ship and it can be moved around freely. Shooting needs to be done manually as there is no autofire. Points are earned by killing enemies, completing levels and collecting items. It has seven stages with up to eight loops and a final boss after a few. Red power-up ships that are shot leave behind one of three items: a weapon upgrade, a bomb that clears the entire screen and a one-hit shield that also explodes when it disappears.</plot>

				<plot>Cho Ren Sha 68k (Ultra Fire 68K) is a top-down vertically scrolling D&#333;jinshi shoot 'em up. It was originally released in 1995 and later it was ported to PC. It is a shooter with classic mechanics modeled after the Toaplan games. There is one ship and it can be moved around freely. Shooting needs to be done manually as there is no autofire. Points are earned by killing enemies, completing levels and collecting items. It has seven stages with up to eight loops and a final boss after a few. Red power-up ships that are shot leave behind one of three items: a weapon upgrade, a bomb that clears the entire screen and a one-hit shield that also explodes when it disappears.</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Columns is a Tetris-style puzzle game in which the player moves and changes the order of a stack of three falling jewels, which must be combined and arranged to connect three of the same type of jewel. The three jewels can be successfully connected horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The game is over when the falling jewels have stacked all the way to the top of the screen. As time progresses, the speed at which the jewels fall increases, and the aim of the game is to last as long as possible to achieve the highest score. Columns also allowed players to compete against each other at the same time or against the computer in a Versus mode.This game came bundled with some Sega Genesis game systems.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Columns is a Tetris-style puzzle game in which the player moves and changes the order of a stack of three falling jewels, which must be combined and arranged to connect three of the same type of jewel. The three jewels can be successfully connected horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The game is over when the falling jewels have stacked all the way to the top of the screen. As time progresses, the speed at which the jewels fall increases, and the aim of the game is to last as long as possible to achieve the highest score. Columns also allowed players to compete against each other at the same time or against the computer in a Versus mode.This game came bundled with some Sega Genesis game systems.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]  View zoomed image in  gallery for animation.     You play as Dig Dug (who is also known as    Taizo Hori in other games that he appears in), a  pump wielding spelunker who faces several enemies while he digs    underground. The object of each level (or board) is to clear it of all of the enemies before they kill you by walking to within a set distance and pushing the button to fill the up with air until they explode. Another more strategic way to dispatch your enemies would be to dig underneath    boulders that are located on each level and drop them on to to enemies that are below them. It could be argued that this was one of the first major acts of  violence  in a video game, but due to it's cartoon like nature it was probably overlooked at the time. The original game was released into arcades by Namco in 1982, and contained the standard (at the time) of 256 levels before you reached a    "kill screen" and the game either froze up or  reset itself. Another source of scoring points throughout the game is the inclusion of a fruit or item in the center of the screen that would appear after dropping two of the levels boulders. This mechanic is very similar to another Namco game series,    Pac-Man. The boulders did not have to drop on enemies for the fruits to appear however. The bonus items include :    Carrot,  Turnip, Zucchini (or Cucumber),    Eggplant,  Green Pepper,    Tomato,    Garlic,    Watermelon,    Pineapple, as well as the inclusion of a  Warship from Namco's    Galaxian.     [CR][B]Enemies:[/B][CR]PookaPooka: Best described as a round orange ball with aviator goggles, Pooka is the most common enemy that you will  face in the game. Not as overly aggressive as his counter part, he as well as Fygar still has the ability to pass through  the un-dug parts of the dirt in each level to attack you from any angle.  FygarFygar: A dragon-like creature, not only can he pass through the dirt and attack you but also has the ability to breathe fire, making him a decidedly more difficult and deadly enemy.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]Dig-Dug is considered to be a classic and has spawned many    sequels and has appeared on many    compilations and game download services since its initial release. The character of DIg-Dug also has a son named Susumu Hori ( that appears in the    Mr. Driller series), continuing the family legacy of digging to the depths of the earth.  Downloading and playing the demo of the XBLA version unlocks a Gamerpic. [CR]Critical Reception[CR]When the Game Boy version was released in 1993 Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the game scores of 6,6,6, and 5.  They stated, "...the game play is intact and the graphics are decent for GB standards.  A few new features [are] thrown in for a little variety and you have a solid little GB cart that's great for long road trips".[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Dragon Slayer</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Dragon Slayer is an action RPG (action role-playing game), developed by Nihon Falcom and designed by Yoshio Kiya. It was originally released on September 10, 1984, for the NEC PC-88 computer, and became a major success in Japan. It was followed by ports to other home computers, including an MSX port published by Square in 1986 (making it one of the first titles to be published by Square), and a Game Boy port by Epoch in 1990. A remake of Dragon Slayer was also included in the Falcom Classics collection for the Sega Saturn.Dragon Slayer began the Dragon Slayer series, a banner which encompasses a number of popular Falcom titles, such as Xanadu, Legacy of the Wizard, Sorcerian, and The Legend of Heroes.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Dragon Slayer is regarded as the progenitor of the action RPG genre, and is considered to be the first action-RPG. In contrast to earlier turn-based roguelikes, Dragon Slayer was a dungeon crawl RPG that was entirely real-time, with action-oriented, hack &amp; slash, real-time combat. In some ways, the foundations of Dragon Slayer's action RPG gameplay can already be seen in Yoshio Kiya's previous 1983 game Panorama Toh.Dragon Slayer featured an in-game map to help with the dungeon-crawling, required item management due to the inventory being limited to one item at a time, and introduced the use of item-based puzzles which later influenced The Legend of Zelda. Dragon Slayer's overhead action-RPG formula was used in many later games, laying the foundations for future action RPG series such as Hydlide, Ys, and The Legend of Zelda. [CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]First released in 1987, Hydlide 3 is an action RPG like its forebears, in which the player runs around a map defeating monsters and earning experience. It plays very much like Hydlide II.The game has NPCs in towns to talk to, equipment and items to buy from shops, and more story presentation including an animated opening cutscene.The game retains the morality meter of its predecessor and expands the time option with an in-game clock and survival elements such as needing to sleep and eat. The game uses four distinct character classes.The plot incorporates sci-fi elements, with settings including forestland, medieval villages, tunnels, a cloud city, medieval castles, futuristic castles, a parallel dimension, and 200 screens of outer space.A graphically enhanced version was later released on the Genesis / Mega Drive as Super Hydlide in 1989, and as Hydlide 3: Special Version on the NEC PC-9801 in 1989 and Sharp X68000 in 1990. Super Hydlide was advertised as "Hollo Fighter" prior to the game's release.[CR][B]Legacy:[/B][CR]In 2007, Alex Lucard of Diehard GameFan listed Super Hydlide at number 27 on his list of top 30 RPGs. He cited the realism instilled by gameplay mechanics such as the encumbrance system, banks, the 24 hour clock, and the need to eat and sleep, and described the game as "Morrowind before there was Morrowind."During production of Scalebound, Platinum Games director Hideki Kamiya said he was inspired by Hydlide 3 on the PC-8801 MA as well as Sorcerian.

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]An RPG based on the Momotarou legend (in fact, the game's name means "Momotarou Legend" or "Peach Boy Legend"), Hudson produced it around the same time as the similarly named and themed Momotarou Dentetsu series, which involves railroads and is more board game-like in nature.Like many early JRPGs, the game plays similarly to Enix's Dragon Quest. The battles are turn-based and the player must explore the world's dungeons for valuable quest items while interacting with NPCs in towns to receive hints on what to do as well as purchase and sell items and equipment. Momotaro is eventually joined by his three animal companions, which were also part of his legend, though they don't act as separate party members in battle.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]An RPG based on the Momotarou legend (in fact, the game's name means "Momotarou Legend" or "Peach Boy Legend"), Hudson produced it around the same time as the similarly named and themed Momotarou Dentetsu series, which involves railroads and is more board game-like in nature.Like many early JRPGs, the game plays similarly to Enix's Dragon Quest. The battles are turn-based and the player must explore the world's dungeons for valuable quest items while interacting with NPCs in towns to receive hints on what to do as well as purchase and sell items and equipment. Momotaro is eventually joined by his three animal companions, which were also part of his legend, though they don't act as separate party members in battle.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Libble Rabble is a 1983 Namco Arcade game, created by the same Namco developer (Tohru Iwatani) that created Pac-Man and Pole Position. It features the characters of Libble and Rabble as they attempt to harvest Mushlins for dinner.The gameplay resembles the once-popular board game where players wrap rubber bands around pegs lined up on a board. The player, as the red (Libble) and blue (Rabble) arrows, must maneuver their attaching string around the pegs on the board and touch in order to create a closed loop. Anything within the loop is either collected (Mushlins, and other bonuses) or temporarily thwarted (Hoodlins, other enemies). Once all the Mushlins on the board are collected, the player moves onto the next stage. If nothing is collected inside a loop, it may spawn an additional enemy on the board.The game was eventually converted to the Sharp X68000, FM Towns and Super Famicom in 1993/94. While keeping most of the basic in-game art of the original Arcade game, it also featured 16-bit cutscenes that described the story.[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Prostitute Maker</title_clean>
				<plot>Prostitute Maker is a life simulation game similar to Princess Maker: a heroic father, who has defeated the forces of Lucifer himself and restored City 13 to its former glory of frivolous pleasures, is entrusted with the task of bringing up his daughter. The distinction between the premises of the two games, however, is significant: the father sees it as his parental duty to turn his child into a prostitute.The game starts when the daughter is already a teenager. Just as in Princess Maker, the player has to make schedules for the girl, comprised out of various activities. These include part-time jobs of various (not necessarily lewd) kinds, studying, resting, taking a trip, etc. Such activities increase the girl's parameters, making her more attractive. It is also possible to buy items and clothes and outfit the girl with them. Once the player feels that his protegee is ready, a meeting with a client can be arranged. Unlike Princess Maker, there is no exploration, battles, or other RPG elements in the game.</plot>

				<plot>Slime Master is a very simple doujin (independent freeware) role-playing game. The player character is sent by a seductive princess to bring back an amulet that was stolen from her. The protagonist then enters a first-person dungeon, which is absolutely linear, consisting of a single corridor navigated by selecting "advance" or "retreat" from a text menu. Enemies looking like cute little girls dressed in warrior and monster costumes would pop out, resulting in simple turn-based battles where the player can choose to attack or use a scroll. Scrolls pop out at certain spots in the dungeon as well or are won by defeating enemies, and include offensive magic and a cure spell. Experience points are awarded for vanquishing enemies, and the player character levels up. After retrieving the amulet the protagonist returns to the princess, who then takes off her underwear in front of him as a token of gratitude. However, the amulet is immediately stolen once again, and the player has to repeat the same process two more times, fighting identically-looking enemies who nevertheless become stronger, and receiving similar erotic awards for these endeavors.</plot>

				<title_clean>Star Luster</title_clean>
				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A typical end of game screen, which uses a very Star Raiders-like ranking system.Star Luster is a space sim/shoot-em-up for the Nintendo Famicom (and much later, the Sharp X68000) that uses the Star Raiders model of having everything viewed first-person from the cockpit, and having to manually select which region of space to visit next and travel there by hyperspace. The goal is to intercept the "E"s on the starmap, which stands for "Enemies". The player can also visit friendly space stations (represented as "B"s, for "Base") to refuel and repair damage. The player can also opt to use one of their limited torpedoes to target an enemy region remotely, though this tactic must be used sparingly.In combat, the player must roll, pitch and yaw their craft to center the enemies on their screen before shooting them down. The player's map changes to a radar in order to help them search for enemies easier. Enemy attacks can also damage the player's ship, but they have to break through a regenerating shield before any permanent damage can be done. It is possible for the player to lose access to their radar and other computer systems after receiving heavy damage, in which case they must return to a base for repairs before they can be used again.Unlike Namco's previous games for the system, which were ports of the company's Arcade hits, Star Luster was the first to be created specifically for the Famicom. It was released into arcades via Nintendo's NES-to-Arcade "Versus System." This version was released slightly later the same year (1985) with a graphically-enhanced Sharp X68000 version released almost a decade later in 1994.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]A screenshot from the 1986 MS-DOS version of Tetris.Tetris was originally created by Alexey Pajitnov, who designed and programmed the game in June 1985 while working in the USSR at the Dorodnicyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Science in Moscow. The name Tetris is a portmanteau of the Greek prefix "tetra", which means "four", and Pajitnov's favorite sport, tennis.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Tetris challenges the player's spatial relation abilities by presenting them with different shapes made of four square blocks. The blocks are presented one at a time at the top of a rectangular play field, and quickly begin descending toward the bottom. The player can rotate the shapes and move them horizontally as they descend, and if you are able to make a complete horizontal line of blocks, that line will clear from the field. In its original form, Tetris was an endurance test, as the speed of the descending shapes would constantly increase as time went on, and the game would end when the play field filled completely with blocks.[CR]Tetris Variants[CR]A number of Tetris variations, both official and otherwise, have been released over the years, including Hatris, Welltris, Super Tetris 2, Tetris Blast and Tetris Attack. Aside from spawning its own spin-offs, Tetris has been highly influential on a large number of puzzle games released in its wake.[CR]IP Rights[CR]The rights to Tetris have been greatly disputed over the years. At one point a British software house named Andromeda was going to purchase the rights, but before the deal with Pajitnov was settled, they sold the rights to Spectrum Holobyte. Even though Andromeda's original deal with Pajitnov fell through, Spectrum Holobyte released what was essentially an unlicensed version of Tetris. After that point the rights began bouncing around, with Atari, Nintendo, the Soviet government, and other entities claiming ownership at various points.[CR]Additional Information[CR]Tetris GiantTetris became even more popular when the game was packaged with the Nintendo Gameboy and helped sell millions of handheld systems.Sega also published a game known as Tetris Giant, the largest licensed Tetris arcade machine.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]R-Type is a classic side scrolling shoot-em up game produced by Irem Corp. The game was first released to Japanese arcades in July 1987. The player controls a spacecraft and is tasked with defending humanity against the alien life forms known as Bydo. R-Type is infamously known for its extreme difficulty.R-Type was originally released in the Arcades and became a major early hit for Irem. It was eventually ported to many home computers and consoles of the era, with the unusual exception of the NES (a bootleg Chinese cart exists, however). The PC Engine of R-Type was split across two releases, but the US TG-16 version manages to fit the whole game onto one HuCard. This TG16 version is also the one that was added to the Wii's Virtual Console in 2006.R-Type also saw multiple sequels and spin-offs, as well as inspiring many future horizontal-scrolling shoot 'em ups.[CR][B]Gameplay:[/B][CR]Set in the 22nd century, the game takes place in the Bydo Empire. The player must make their way through the 8 merciless levels and defend mankind from the evil attackers. Bydo Dobkeratops - Boss of the first levelThe Bydo are biologically engineered weapons created by mankind to be used against their enemies in their quest for universal domination. This plan backfired however and the Bydo began to attack their creators.   The Ship The player pilots a ship called the R-9a "Arrowhead". The ship is named for its distinctive shape and is the 9th model of the R series of star fighter. The ForceThe R-9a "Arrowhead" can be equipped with an indestructible living weapon called "The Force". The force, a spherical pod that can be attached to the ship, is made of Bydo flesh and can absorb energy in order to increase in power. To obtain the force, the player must obtain a weapon power up. The force will appear behind the players ship and they can obtain the force by flying into it. The force acts as the ship's weapon system and will fire in the whatever direction it is facing. The force also acts as a shield and can be used to block incoming enemy attacks. The force has three levels of power. Collecting weapon power ups increases the power level of the force. The forces visual appearance changes as it increases in power.Red - A powerful counter-air laser beam that fires horizontally.Blue - Three thin laser beams. One forward firing and two that fire at a 45 degree angle from the front of the ship These beams rebound off walls.Yellow - Two flame beams that fire above and below the ship. These flames can travel along the ground or walls to destroy enemies.The force can be controlled by the user by using the force button. By pressing the force button, the user can attach the force to the front or the rear of the ship. They can also propel the force forward to execute an attack called the "force ram". Wave CannonThe R9-a is equipped with a beam weapon called the wave cannon. Holding the fire button will charge up the wave cannon and increase its power. Wave Cannon     [CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Xevious is a vertical scrolling shoot-em-up developed by Namco and released in the Arcade in 1982. It is one of the first games of its genre, and contributed many things to that genre, including the concept of bosses. The game is known for having one continuous level, featuring forests, bases, temples, and waterways. Xevious was a huge cult hit in Japan, despite its limited popularity in the United States. The game was also considered to be the first Arcade game to have a television commercial aired for it in the United States.The player controls a Solvalou, a combat aircraft containing both a front-firing "shooter" for anti-air combat and a "bomber" for air-to-ground bombing runs. The game contains both enemy aircraft and enemy ground units, such as tanks and turrets. It is one of the first shoot-em-ups to include hidden bonuses, which could be uncovered by bombing particular areas in the game (these include the SOL towers, which takes one bomb to reveal and one to destroy, and special flags). It is also one of the first shoot-em-ups to include a boss, the massive flying fortress Andor Genesis.The game was also known for its glitches and Easter eggs. It's possible to see a short message showing the programmer's name by moving to the bottom-right of the screen, holding down the bomb button and destroying the first two enemies. Another rare Arcade glitch gave the player countless amounts of lives.Xevious was ported to many systems, including the NES, Atari 8-bit, Atari 7800, NEC PC-8801, NEC PC-9801, MSX, FM-7, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Atari ST, Apple II, Amstrad CPC, Sharp X1, and the Sharp X68000. The original Arcade game has been in many of Namco's compilations, including Namco Museum Volume 2 for the PlayStation, Namco Museum: 50th Anniversary for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Gamecube, Namco Museum Remix for the Wii, Namco Museum DS for the Nintendo DS, Namco Museum Battle Collection for the PSP, and Namco Museum Essentials for the PlayStation Network (PS3). The game was released as a Xbox Live Arcade game on the Xbox Live Marketplace for 400 MSP ($5), which was later included in Namco Museum: Virtual Arcade for the Xbox 360. The game was also part of the Microsoft Revenge of Arcade compilation for the PC. The NES version of Xevious was also released for Game Boy Advance as part of the Classic NES Series.Xevious spawned a few obscure sequels. Super Xevious, released a year later on the arcades, was a harder version of the original with several new enemies. Solvalou, released in 1991 in Japan, is a version of Xevious shown from the first-person perspective. Xevious 3D/G, released in 1995 for arcades and the PlayStation, added 3D graphics while retaining the 2D viewpoint of the original. Xevious Arrangement was a special version of Xevious created for Namco Classic Collection Vol. 1. Xevious Resurrection is another special version of Xevious, but created for Namco Museum Essentials.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>[CR][B]Overview:[/B][CR]Ys: The Vanished Omens (also referred to as Ys 1: Ancient Ys Vanished and The Ancient Land of Ys) is the first game in Falcom's long-running Ys series. As with almost every subsequent game, the player controls a quiet but steadfast redheaded swordsman named Adol Christin as he fights to uncover an ancient mystery and defeat the evil entity behind it all.Ys is notable for being one of the earliest story-driven Japanese RPGs, providing many NPCs for Adol to talk to and a constant string of goals and side-quests to follow that tie directly in with the narrative. This is opposed to the previously standard system, which left players to simply explore dungeons at their own pace with usually nothing more than an introductory text crawl and a nebulously evil final boss to head towards. The game's forgiving action-RPG gameplay, which included regenerating health among a number of other features, made it more accessible than most computer RPGs at the time.Ys was originally created for the NEC PC-8801 home computer, but was later ported to many other home computers in Japan, mostly unedited. It also received several console versions. Each was significant in its own way: Victor Musical Industries published Nintendo Famicom version was greatly modified from the original PC-8801 version, in terms of dungeon layouts, graphics and enemy encounters; the NEC Turbografx-16 version would later be adapted into a two-part compilation with its sequel Ys II for the system's CD-based upgrade, complete with additional anime cutscenes; and the Sega Master System version is one of the few to be translated into English and released in the US. There were also Apple-II and DOS home computer versions for US gamers.The Turbografx-CD compilation Ys I &amp; II (often known as Ys Books I &amp; II) would also be released a few more times with additional features and graphical improvements, first as an updated version for PC in 2001 called Ys I &amp; II Complete and eventually for the PS2, DS (Legacy of Ys: Books I &amp; II) and PSP (Ys I &amp; II Chronicles). A second PC version was released in 2007. With the exception of the DS and PSP versions, these remakes were all Japan-only.[CR]</plot>
