			<emu_comment>MSX2 No Intro List by Zach Morris.  This list is the FULL UNFILTERED LIST from the archive.[CR]MSX2 is the 2nd in 4 generations of computer based systems in the MSX line.[CR]The MSX is a standardized home computer architecture.  Despite Microsoft's involvement, the MSX-based machines were seldom released in the United States, but were popular in Asian countries like Japan and South Korea, South American countries like Brazil and Chile, and in the European market in countries like the Netherlands, France, Spain and Finland. To a lesser extent, the MSX platform was also popular in the former Soviet Union and Kuwait.[CR]Before the appearance and great success of Nintendo's Family Computer, MSX was the platform for which major Japanese game studios, such as Konami and Hudson Soft, produced video game titles. The Metal Gear series, for example, was originally written for MSX hardware.[CR]Developer:  ASCII Corporation[CR]Manufacturer :  Microsoft[CR]CPU:  Zilog Z80A running at 3.58 MHz[CR]Memory: 32 kB ROM / 8 kb RAM[CR]Graphics:  Yamaha V9938 128 KB[CR]Sound:  Yamaha YM2149[CR]Display:  512Ã—212 (16 colors)[CR]Media:  Cartridge and Floppy</emu_comment>

				<plot>The player flies a BD5J, a small agile jet. The player has to complete a series of eight stunt courses and routines with the jet. For example, in one set, the player has to fly the plane around a series of pylons. In another, the player must fly a figure eight. Stunts get harder as play progresses. Some game parameters, such as weather, are configurable.[CR]There are ten acrobatic events which can be played by up to four players at four levels of difficulty. In all ten events the player must fly over a series of obstacles.</plot>

				<plot>The story of Aleste concerns the manmade supercomputer DIA 51, which has been infected by a hybrid virus that is spreading like wildfire, eventually leading DIA 51 to eliminate the human race. When Yuri, Ray's girlfriend, gets injured in DIA's assault, Raymond Waizen has all the reason in the world to get rid of DIA 51 once and for all in his Aleste fighter.[CR]Aleste is more or less the sequel to Zanac, as it features the same AI generated enemy waves and weapon system. It did, however, start a whole new plot - evil plant creatures were taking over the planet, so you fight against monstrous vines and other types of twisted vegetation. The scrolling is also much improved over the choppiness of the original Zanac MSX.</plot>

				<plot>Become Genghis Khan and lead the most fearsome army in the known world. Use your Land of Mongols to build an empire on the bodies of your enemies and the rubble of their conquered cities. With skill, cunning, diplomacy and luck, all of Europe and Asia could be yours. Failure means shame in the eyes of your princess, or even death! Victory on the battlefield requires bold strategy and clever planning. Outmaneuver your opponent with cavalry, lay siege to his castle with archers or even challenge him to a duel. But success also requires brilliant political tactics and a sharp eye for business during times of peace. Genghis Khan is based on actual history and offers a blend of strategy and role playing elements. Make history as you play the great Khan himself or his rivals, Richard the Lionhearted, Emperor Alexious III, or Shogun Minamoto of Japan.</plot>

Howerver, when Banutracus returned to his planet he killed the father and re-established his hold. One Cooligan Gea saw the evil nature of Banutracus and escaped with the father's only daughter Neshah to one of the great ruined Eletrian cities. There, they had a son. When the boy grew to be a strong young man, one of the Cooligan soldiers discovered their hideout and killed his escaped parents. From that day, the boy swore vengeance on Banutracus and to eventually restore peace to the planet.&#8221;</plot>

				<plot>Crimson is a medieval-themed role-playing game similar to Dragon Quest. The player controls a lone character, a young man whose father sent him on a mission to defeat the evil monster Crimson before passing away. Exploration is done in an overhead fashion, and is divided into world map and hostile areas, which are usually maze-like and contain one or more dungeons each. In towns the hero can buy weapons, armor, and items, as well as rest in inns.[CR]Enemies appear randomly, and the battles are turn-based. The player character can either attack, defend, or use an item. Combat is viewed from a first-person perspective. Unlike Dragon Quest, there are no random encounters on the world map. Exploration is non-linear, i.e. the player has access to many areas of the map from the beginning of the game.</plot>

				<title_clean>Daisenryaku MSX2</title_clean>
				<plot>Super Daisenryaku is one of the many titles in SystemSoft's long-running war strategy series. The game mechanics are based on Daisenryaku II, but many of the included maps are unique to this release, including several based on Phantasy Star in Sega's console version. There is no campaign mode, and any of the included maps can be played. Some maps are for two players, some for four, and any map can be played with any combination of human and computer players. The computer versions also feature an editor.The game is played on a large map made up of hexagonal spaces, each of which consists of one of the included  terrain types. Each player controls a number of units (bought with money), which each take up one space on the grid. The unit types are for the most part based on real-life military equipment from around the time the game was released, what is available to the player depends on the chosen faction. The choices range from single nations, such as China or the USA (the CD port by Microcabin in particular adds a lot of smaller ones, like Sweden and Libya),  to alliances and blocs, for example NATO, which uses a mixture of equipment of it's members. Different units have different strengths and weaknesses, which affect their performance in combat and their general role on the battlefield. The cheap infantry units for example are not very strong and mobile, but may capture facilities and cities, unlike battle tanks. Terrain also affects the outcome of battles. The goal of each game is to capture the other players' capitals.</plot>

				<plot>The game takes place within a gigantic spaceship which has virtually infinite capacity because of its ability to manipulate time and space. The player must deal with enigmatic creatures called EVOL, which consist only of pure energy and need to keep themselves in capsules in order to maintain their existence in the world.[CR]All of the characters in the game are designed to resemble microscopic organisms, both in their appearance and their quick, tricky movements. The player's ship undergoes over 10 types of transformations throughout the game, each with offensive and defensive maneuvers specific to their design. The sound effects used are minimal, but different types of sounds are used according to the type of shots or their speed. A sound resembling a long scream results when the player's ship is hit and returns to its weakest evolutionary state. The game's designer, graphic designer, and music composer, Tomo Furukawa, would go on to become the vocalist of the band Guniw Tools.The game controls like a regular shoot-'em-up: A and C shoot bullets, B drops bombs; there is rapidfire. However, unlike regular shoot-'em-ups where weapons are upgraded through powerups, your ship "evolves" to survive situations and get past obstacles. Evolution occurs with the Evol (small faces with an E on them) and B-Evol (darker Evols). Each pickup adds a new evolution state to the list. After a particular amount of time, one evolution wears off and the next evolution is chosen. The DNA powerup does provide a more permanent weapon upgrade, but will merely just make the existing weapons stronger. You can hold up to nine DNA powerups.</plot>

However, unlike regular shoot-'em-ups where weapons are upgraded through powerups, your ship "evolves" to survive situations and get past obstacles. Evolution occurs with the Evol (small faces with an E on them) and B-Evol (darker Evols). Each pickup adds a new evolution state to the list. After a particular amount of time, one evolution wears off and the next evolution is chosen.

				<plot>The game takes place within a gigantic spaceship which has virtually infinite capacity because of its ability to manipulate time and space. The player must deal with enigmatic creatures called EVOL, which consist only of pure energy and need to keep themselves in capsules in order to maintain their existence in the world.[CR]All of the characters in the game are designed to resemble microscopic organisms, both in their appearance and their quick, tricky movements. The player's ship undergoes over 10 types of transformations throughout the game, each with offensive and defensive maneuvers specific to their design. The sound effects used are minimal, but different types of sounds are used according to the type of shots or their speed. A sound resembling a long scream results when the player's ship is hit and returns to its weakest evolutionary state.

				<title_clean>Dragon Buster</title_clean>
				<plot>Originating in the arcades, Dragon Buster is an action platform game composed out of several large levels, each one containing various stages: a cave, a tower, a castle, etc. The player's goal in every level is to reach the final stage where the protagonist faces the level boss. There are often several ways to reach the final stages, and not all stages are necessary to visit. Equipped with a sword, the player character moves through platform stages, clearing them of diverse monsters, collecting power-ups and trying to stay in good health until the level boss, since it is impossible to heal between the stages. The hero's life meter (called "vitality" in the game) is the first introduction of such a feature to action games.</plot>

However only one weapon is capable of doing this, the Dragon Slayer, which is itself sealed away by four magical crowns.

The choices are: Xemm the father and woodcutter, Mayna the magic-using mother, Roas the brave warrior son, Lyll the athletic daughter and Pochi the domesticated monster-pet. Each character has unique abilities (including attack and jumping abilities) and can only use certain items from those collected. Players can travel back to the Drasle household at any point to change characters.[CR]The object of the game is to enter the large dungeon, itself divided into 5 areas, collecting a variety of items (which as mentioned, can only be used by particular characters) and use them to progress through the dungeon, defeating monsters. Power-ups dropped by monsters include gold, keys, health-restoring bread, magic-restoring potions and health-damaging poison. Gold can be spent on items and other power-ups that are available at various shops hidden inside the dungeon. The player must eventually defeat the four bosses guarding the crowns that seal the Dragon Slayer and then use that weapon to defeat the Kress.</plot>

				<plot>Druid is an action game inspired by the arcade hit Gauntlet. As the eponymous hero, your job is to destroy four magic skulls hidden over eight levels. [CR]The game is presented in a top-down view. The druid walks around the terrain seeking out the staircase that leads to the next level. On the way, he is harassed by hordes of monsters that come out of every direction and attack him, decreasing his health. To defend himself, the druid can use the spells of water, fire or electricity to toss projectiles. However, these magical weapons have limited ammo. [CR]The druid also has three other magical spells at his disposal - an invisibility spell which prevents the monsters from automatically approaching him, a golem spell which summons a helpful golem (which can be controlled by a second player), and a skull spell which destroys all on-screen enemies. The druid also carries around keys which open locked doors. But all these have very limited supplies. [CR]On his way, the druid finds many shops. Each such shop contains some keys or charges for the druid's spells, but the druid can only pick one item from each shop. [CR]The druid can also come across a pentagram on the ground which will restore his lost health.</plot>

				<plot>Druid is an action game inspired by the arcade hit Gauntlet. As the eponymous hero, your job is to destroy four magic skulls hidden over eight levels. [CR]The game is presented in a top-down view. The druid walks around the terrain seeking out the staircase that leads to the next level. On the way, he is harassed by hordes of monsters that come out of every direction and attack him, decreasing his health. To defend himself, the druid can use the spells of water, fire or electricity to toss projectiles. However, these magical weapons have limited ammo. [CR]The druid also has three other magical spells at his disposal - an invisibility spell which prevents the monsters from automatically approaching him, a golem spell which summons a helpful golem (which can be controlled by a second player), and a skull spell which destroys all on-screen enemies. The druid also carries around keys which open locked doors. But all these have very limited supplies. [CR]On his way, the druid finds many shops. Each such shop contains some keys or charges for the druid's spells, but the druid can only pick one item from each shop. [CR]The druid can also come across a pentagram on the ground which will restore his lost health.</plot>

				<plot>Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five different wizards and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that stands without a ruler  after the master wizard's death. You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen. Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.</plot>

				<title_clean>Ganbare Goemon! - Karakuri Douchuu</title_clean>
				<plot>The second game in the Ganbare Goemon series (known in English as Mystical Ninja) and the first released on a video game console and home computer. It was initially released for the Family Computer July 30, 1986[1] and later released for the MSX one year later.[CR]The game revolves around the main character, Goemon, and his exploits. As the name suggests, his character was based on Ishikawa Goemon, the noble thief of Japanese Folklore. Unlike its sequels, this game still doesn't feature the comic situation and strange characters that define the series, and Goemon is portrayed as a noble thief rather than a plain hero.[2][CR]The game plays a top view action/adventure game (similar to The Legend of Zelda) though it is separated by stages. In each level Goemon must find three passes in order to advance. Some of these passes are found in boxes, secret passages or can be bought. After finishing all the stages, the game will present you with a new Japanese province (eight total), but all the levels will remain the same. The ending, however, will be different.[CR]Like the rest of the series, Goemon can be powered up if certain items are found and/or bought, which can be lost after a few hits.[CR]The MSX version has the option to be played in turns by two players, with the second player playing as a ninja named Nezumi Koz&#333;, which is the basis of Goemon's sidekick Ebisumaru. In addition, unlike the Family Computer version, the game has six more provinces with completely new levels after finishing the game once.</plot>

				<plot>In our universe matter and anti-matter co-exist with each other. However, prevalence of anti-matter may create chaos and eventually disrupt the normal flow of things. In a corner of a universe, a concentration of anti-matter led to the creation of an entire star, breeding forms of life threatening to destroy the world. Human beings, in an effort to save the universe, created the powerful Andorogynus - a life form capable of being male and female at once - and sent it on a mission to destroy the creation of anti-matter.Andorogynus (sic) is a top-down shoot-em-up. The player controls the titular hero(ine), shooting at constantly attacking enemies. Unlike in most games of the type, the screen scrolls down rather than up. The protagonist is equipped with a default single shot and has protective orbs revolving around that damage nearby enemies. The weapon can be enhanced (rapid fire, three-way fire, etc.) by collecting randomly descending power-ups. The player controls the male incarnation of the protagonist initially, but later switches to the female one.</plot>

				<plot>In our universe matter and anti-matter co-exist with each other. However, prevalence of anti-matter may create chaos and eventually disrupt the normal flow of things. In a corner of a universe, a concentration of anti-matter led to the creation of an entire star, breeding forms of life threatening to destroy the world. Human beings, in an effort to save the universe, created the powerful Andorogynus - a life form capable of being male and female at once - and sent it on a mission to destroy the creation of anti-matter.Andorogynus (sic) is a top-down shoot-em-up. The player controls the titular hero(ine), shooting at constantly attacking enemies. Unlike in most games of the type, the screen scrolls down rather than up. The protagonist is equipped with a default single shot and has protective orbs revolving around that damage nearby enemies. The weapon can be enhanced (rapid fire, three-way fire, etc.) by collecting randomly descending power-ups. The player controls the male incarnation of the protagonist initially, but later switches to the female one.</plot>

				<plot>Taking the basic concept of Pirate Ship Higemaru, the Arcade game on which it is based, and expandings on it, is an adventure game as expansive and in-depth as the Legend of Zelda.[CR]The goal is to sail around until the player finds a pirate ship (the friendly green merchant ships will simply provide hints) and clear the boss. Doing so will allow the player to collect a port key which allows them to set anchor on one of the titular seven islands. The player must then remove the boss of that island and recover the treasure. At which point, the process must be repeated.</plot>

				<title_clean>Hydlide 3 - The Space Memories</title_clean>
				<plot>The third entry in the Hydlide series, continuing its action RPG legacy. Character creation allows the player to choose one of the four character classes: Warrior, Thief, Priest, and Monk. In combat, the protagonist uses melee or long-ranged weapons or casts magic spells. Unlike the previous games in the series, the player is required to press the attack button during melee combat, instead of simply "bumping" into the enemies. There is an internal clock in the game, which makes it necessary for the protagonist to sleep periodically and regain his strength. The main character also has to eat from time to time, otherwise his hit points will gradually decrease. The morality system from the previous game returns: killing friendly creatures will reduce the player's morality level, which will eventually have an effect on one of the game's most decisive battles.</plot>

				<plot>1581, Japan. Fearing a rebellion and striving to conquer the entire country, the warlock Nobunaga orders to attack the Iga ninja clan. The ninjas bravely defend their village, but, being vastly outnumbered, are mercilessly slain by Nobunaga's men. Only one survived: you, the hero of the game. Shortly before the assault you were sent to a nearby village to warn the elder of Nobunaga's attack. However, the other village is also destroyed by Nobunaga's army. You swear to avenge his crime. But for now, you are just an inexperienced young men, and are "wanted" by Nobunaga's men and ruthless bounty hunters. Will you be able to unite Japan in the ultimate struggle against Nobunaga?[CR]Inindo: Way of the Ninja is a Japanese-style RPG with a touch of strategy. You navigate your hero on the world map, visit towns, and descend into dungeons. The battles are turn-based and are viewed from a third-person perspective, like in Final Fantasy games. You can move on the battle field and use melee or long-ranged attacks. You'll be able to recruit characters of various classes to your party, who will join you for profit or for other reasons. After you gain enough experience, you'll also be able to talk to daimyos (feudal rulers) of various castles and to convince them to work together against Nobunaga. You can also perform various tasks for the daimyos, such as spying.</plot>

				<title_clean>Ishin no Arashi</title_clean>
				<plot>Ishin no Arashi is set during Bakumatsu period (around 1850 until the Meiji Restoration of 1867), the final stretch of the Japanese Edo period, which was a turbulent time, a time of great struggle between the supporters of the feudal shoguns, the rulers of the country, and the adherents of the Emperor, which eventually won and carried through the Meiji Restoration, turning Japan into a modern, powerful state. In Ishin no Arashi the player can choose one of the three major battles of Bakumastu period, and decide which leader will eventually propel Japan towards the Meiji era.[CR]This strategy game is somewhat similar to the better-known Romance of the Three Kingdoms series and other historical simulation games by the same company, but also differs from them by having much less complex diplomacy options and focusing the gameplay on navigation and individual encounters. Before beginning, the player chooses a general and customizes his parameters (stamina, attack power, charisma, knowledge). The player then controls the general with soldiers of his choice, navigating him on grids representing towns and countryside of Japan in turn-based fashion. The grids can be occupied by shops, schools (to train the general), friendly and hostile characters and groups. Battles, as well as negotiations and diplomatic procedures, are carried out automatically, and their outcome depends on the characters' statistics.</plot>

				<plot>Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game in which you choose one of five different wizards and fight the other wizards for domination of the land that stands without a ruler  after the master wizard's death. You can play in two campaigns against the computer which requires you to defeat the enemy wizards on all maps and allows you to take all units that have survived a battle into the next one. You can also play all maps individually with up two four human players. In battles, you can summon different monsters and cast spells. Which monsters you can summon and which spells you can use depends on which wizard you have chosen. Your aim in every battle is to defeat all other wizards and thus conquering the land (In the campaigns you only have a limited number of turns to do so). Your wizard and monsters gain experience from fighting and your monsters' abilities differ largely from one-another. For example some monsters can execute long-range attacks, some have strong magic attacks but are physically weak. Furthermore, their movement is affected by different terrain types. While flying monsters can move freely, most of the other monster have a preferred terrain type (lizards move best in water etc.). You can summon up two 30 monsters per battle, but how many monsters you can summon each turn is not only determined by the amount of MP, but also by the number of towers that you control, which makes conquering and defending towers a key-element in battles.</plot>

				<plot>Near the end of the 20th century, a small fortified nation named Outer Heaven (founded by a mysterious war hero whose name and identity are shrouded in secrecy) is threatening the nations of the "West" with the development of a new prototype weapon named Metal Gear, a walking tank which is capable of launching nuclear warheads from anywhere on the globe. As FOX-HOUND's (an elite black ops unit) newest recruit, going by the codename of Solid Snake, your mission is to infiltrate Outer Heaven and rescue your missing comrade, Grey Fox (who was captured after a failed infiltration), while gathering intelligence on Metal Gear. [CR]In order to fulfill this objective, the player must collect various weapons and equipments (including keycards for further access into the fortress), while avoiding visual contact with the enemy. The player must also confront bosses in the form of Outer Heaven's elite mercenary force and rescue hostages hidden within the fortress in order to increase player rank, which gives Snake an extended life bar and increased storage capacity for replenishable items and ammo. The player can use a wireless transceiver to come in touch with their commanding officer, Big Boss, to learn more about their current mission objectives or contact one of the local resistance members operating covertly within the fortress to gain useful tips and insights.</plot>

The driving element of the gameplay is to stay unnoticed. If guards spot you, you don't have much chance in combat, unless you are armed with appropriate weapons, which aren't easily acquired. Snake can use a variety of weapons and gadgets to help him survive during his mission. He can also hide behind objects, punch guards, and crawl.

				<plot>The year is 720 of the Galactic Era. Humans have ventured into deep space and found they were not alone in the universe. Alien life forms populated the galaxy, both friendly and hostile. The Rainbow Nebula is home to that last kind, and the protagonist of the game is the only one who can fight them.[CR]Mirai is a sci-fi shooter with strong role-playing elements. The player controls the protagonist who uses a jetpack to fly through scrolling maze-like environments. Experience points and money are gained from defeating the numerous respawning enemies. Money can be used in the few friendly areas to purchase weapons and items. The player also has to keep an eye on the fuel gauge for the protagonist's jetpack.</plot>

				<plot>The game tells another story in Ninja-kun series. This time it&#8217;s a platform game with some twists. There are two tasks alternating through levels: you are required either to kill every enemy in the level (as in the previous games) or simply to reach the exit. Running into enemies usually won&#8217;t kill you, however if you are hit by a single projectile, you&#8217;ll have to start from a checkpoint. Enemies vary from plain ninjas to giant skeletons or killer fish. Each level has a time limit, and when this limit is close to an end a fire wheel of death will appear on the screen, chasing Ninja-kun.[CR]Ninja-kun has some techniques for successful progression though the levels: many enemies can be temporarily stunned by jumping on them or hitting them from below; and ninja can obtain some power-ups including boomerang, bombs, a devastating fire attack or invincibility. Ninja-kun is capable of wall climbing and wall jumping, the latter requiring some practice from the player.[CR]The levels (called &#8220;scenes&#8221; in-game) are scattered through mountains, caves, beaches and underwater locations. You can choose which set of levels you&#8217;ll start in by playing a mini-game at the beginning.</plot>

				<plot>Nobunaga no Yabou: Sengoku Gunyuuden is the third game in the Nobunaga series. The setting is 16th century feudal Japan, a period when ruthless daimyo (feudal lords) contended with each other for dominance. Ultimately, the winner in this struggle will become Shogun and hold actual power over the islands, while being nominally subject to the Emperor.[CR]The game casts the player as one of the daimyo, allowing them freedom to decide the fate and future of feudal Japan, through diplomacy and ultimately war. The objective is to unify Japan under the player's rule. If the player fails through death on the battlefield, assassination at the hands of a ninja, or through natural causes, they can choose a successor and play on.</plot>

				<plot>Nobunaga no Yabou: Zenkokuban is the second game in the Nobunaga series. In the 16th century, Japan's Sengoku ("Warring States") period divided the nation into numerous feudal states, each ruled by a daimyo. These daimyos would often go to war with each other. Many dreamt of conquering the land, becoming the Shogun and ruling the entire country. One of those daimyos was the ambitious Nobunaga Oda, a merciless ruler and a renowned strategist. Players take on the role of Nobunaga Oda or one of many other daimyos to try to conquer Japan.[CR]Players begin by selecting either a 17 regions scenario or a larger 50 scenario. Then, the player must select a daimyo, each of which is rated attributes in several categories; Age, Health, Ambition, Luck, Charm and IQ. As the game progresses, these values change depending on events in the game. The age value represents a time limit of sorts, as an elderly daimyo becomes increasingly likely to die of old age or sickness.</plot>

And it's up to Vick to switch off the core functions of El Giza.[CR]The game consists of six pyramids each with its own wall engravings and color pattern; every pyramid contains 10 levels. The idea of the game is to collect crystals called soul stones in each level by solving the different puzzles and evading or killing the enemies using the many tools and weapons available to unlock the exit door that will take you to the next level.[CR]The game was released both for the MSX1 and MSX2 systems. The MSX2 version only saw a release in Japan. The MSX 2 version was the same game except minor changes like the music was remixed and some of the items and backgrounds recolored.</plot>

RTK can be said to be much more 'stable' where players no longer have to worry that much about time length in the game, as the game take a slower time rate to allow the players to build up their forces without much interference. The RTK II gameplay and interface is closely similar to Nobunaga's Ambition II.</plot>

The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.[CR]This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on and features five preset challenges, some of which have time limits of five or ten minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</plot>

				<plot>Due to mysterious circumstances, a flourishing city called Chinese Hill was cut off the rest of the world. Investigators found out that most of the buildings were destroyed, horrifying creatures are roaming the wilderness, and the few survivors have no means of escaping. The SSWAT (Supernatural Special Weapon Attack Team) sends an agent named Laila to the city. The young woman has powerful psychic abilities, which can enhance her firearms, helping her deal with the monsters. She must rescue the survivors and escort them to safety, at any cost...[CR]Shiryo Sensen - War of the Dead is an action game with slight RPG elements. The player navigates Laila over the top-down "world map": the ruined city has basically turned into large wilderness areas with a few buildings that are represented by icons on the map and can be explored. Enemies attack randomly. The battles take place on separate side-scrolling screens, and are fully action-based. Laila can jump, duck, and attack with melee or weapons or firearms (which require ammunition). Typically there are several enemies on the screen; Laila escapes the battle if she reaches the end of the short side-scrolling area. [CR]The goal of the game is to find and rescue the few survivors trapped in the buildings infested by enemies. Laila has to bring these survivors back to the church. Even though the map is almost completely open to the player (especially after Laila acquires a boat, which makes the world fully explorable), the rescuing must be completed in a linear fashion, by talking to characters in different buildings and receiving clues. The game has a day/night cycle; Laila can sleep at any time, which will restore a portion of her health.</plot>

				<plot>In the year 189 of the stellar calendar, humanity happened upon the ruins of an ancient (and, if the st. 7 decor is anything to go by, rather decadent and malicious) civilization, and sent an archaeological crew to explore them. However, the crew managed to activate the ruins' defense system.[CR]The system operated by identifying the Sol system as the intruders' origin, then launched the Sun-Fish ("Manbou" being Japanese for "Sunfish"), an ultimate weapon bio-mechanical starship capable of destroying an entire solar system and protected by an impregnable force-field bubble. The surviving members of the crew, however, find a chance to stop the Sun-Fish. By using an unearthed Manbou-J (i.e. Junior Sun-Fish) fighter and activating a teleportation system in the deepest part of the ruins, one pilot, Cleaver Mule, can actually get inside the force bubble and destroy the Sun-Fish from there.</plot>

Its a camp science fiction fantasy comedy about a girl whose secretly the lone fighter of justice Star Virgin, its her pursuit to stop the planet being attacked from robotic &amp; puppet monsters, giant spiders and whatever else would warrant as being an end of level boss in an 80s video game... at least I think thats the overall idea, because its obviously never been translated into English its hard to totally fathom out what the hells going on, but hey thats the beauty of the Japanese movies right.[CR]Star Virgin herself is every Japanorama fanboys wetdream, shes a cute pink power ranger with her own spacecraft &amp; powerbike and she kicks ass with a bazooka. The whole thing would have made an awesome music video for The Flaming Lips - Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots (what I'm oddly playing while writing this). Sure its none essential throwaway stuff, but its a fun hour even without knowing what they're saying.[CR][Personal Reasons For Remembering][CR]Really loved the spacecraft scenes complete with their robotic butler drivers and its not every day I get to see a movie featuring a robotic Statue of Liberty and an evil genius who lives on a floating volcanic island.</plot>

That was made to promote a little seen videogame of the same name distributed by Activision that only ever appeared on the long forgotten msx system.[CR]Plays out pretty much like a bonkers live action anime movie. Its a camp science fiction fantasy comedy about a girl whose secretly the lone fighter of justice Star Virgin, its her pursuit to stop the planet being attacked from robotic &amp; puppet monsters, giant spiders and whatever else would warrant as being an end of level boss in an 80s video game... at least I think thats the overall idea, because its obviously never been translated into English its hard to totally fathom out what the hells going on, but hey thats the beauty of the Japanese movies right.[CR]Star Virgin herself is every Japanorama fanboys wetdream, shes a cute pink power ranger with her own spacecraft &amp; powerbike and she kicks ass with a bazooka. The whole thing would have made an awesome music video for The Flaming Lips - Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots (what I'm oddly playing while writing this). Sure its none essential throwaway stuff, but its a fun hour even without knowing what they're saying.[CR][Personal Reasons For Remembering][CR]Really loved the spacecraft scenes complete with their robotic butler drivers and its not every day I get to see a movie featuring a robotic Statue of Liberty and an evil genius who lives on a floating volcanic island.</plot>

				<plot>Strategic Mars is a shooter from dB-Soft. You start the game from player base, where you can buy upgrades when you get enough points from shooting enemies. At first you can upgrade your engine, repair the ship and get missiles which launch automatically against every enemy wave you face.[CR]You navigate and warp to fight enemies from the map screen, which tells you the difficulty of the enemies. Fuchsia dots have the easiest enemies and red icons the hardest. Once you clear all enemies from the map, you move to the next level. There are 12 levels in total, and you can even start from the last level if you so wish from the start screen, no passwords needed.</plot>

				<plot>In the 12th century, the Emperor Hui Zhong is faced with an internal rebellion led by Imperial Minister Gao Qiu. The Song Dynasty comes to an end, and Gao Qiu became the new ruler. You take the role of an exiled ruler, and you must build your stats up to be able to challenge- and destroy- Gao Qiu and restore Hui Zhong to the throne.[CR]The game is a military strategy game, like most of Koei's games, but instead of conquering a country, the goal is to depose the despotic ruler of China. You start out lowly, and have to work your way up by conquering smaller prefectures, forming alliances, and fighting small battles. You have to earn the right to attack Gao Qiu's home prefecture, though- he is off limits until you are powerful.</plot>

The unit types are for the most part based on real-life military equipment from around the time the game was released, what is available to the player depends on the chosen faction. The choices range from single nations, such as China or the USA (the CD port by Microcabin in particular adds a lot of smaller ones, like Sweden and Libya), to alliances and blocs, for example NATO, which uses a mixture of equipment of it's members. [CR]Different units have different strengths and weaknesses, which affect their performance in combat and their general role on the battlefield. The cheap infantry units for example are not very strong and mobile, but may capture facilities and cities, unlike battle tanks. Terrain also affects the outcome of battles. The goal of each game is to capture the other players' capitals.</plot>

Killing enemies gives you experience (EXP), and when your experience bar is full your life bar increases (H.P).

The player controls a nameless adventurer who searches for the Sun Key, a mysterious ancient artifact which can unlock the secrets of the Mayan civilization.[CR]Taiyo no Shinden: Asteka II is an adventure game which takes place in the ruins of the ancient city Chichen Itza on the Yucatan peninsula in Mexico. There is a top-down overworld on which the player can physically navigate the protagonist, entering temples and other locations. In such locations, the view switches to first-person perspective. The player interacts with the environment by selecting various verb commands ("Look", "Take", "Use", etc.), represented by icons, from a menu, and combining them with objects on the screen. In spite of its Japanese origins, the game features inventory item usage and puzzle-solving, which are more typical of Western-style adventures.</plot>

				<title_clean>Tetris</title_clean>
				<plot>This version of Tetris is one of many conversions of the famous block-stacking game. The goal is to place pieces made up of four tiles in a ten-by-twenty well, organizing them into complete rows, which then disappear. The goal of each round is to clear 25 lines, after which the player moves on to the next round. If the stack reaches the top of the field, the player loses a life, and if all three lives are lost, the game is over.[CR]The game lets the player choose the starting stage and round, as well as one of three background tunes. Difficulty is increased throughout the stages by an increase in speed and the addition of garbage blocks in the well.</plot>

				<plot>Topple Zip is a vertically scrolling shooter that is marketed as a racing game. The basic premise is that you control an aircraft and fly in competition against several other, computer controlled crafts. In addition to shooting at your opponents, you may ram into them, and they into you. Doing so may dislodge a pill shaped power-up from them which you can then shoot and collect. [CR]Power-ups exist in various types, including defensive and offensive such as giving you better weapons. There are eight different levels, each of which contain a number of warps which link to other levels. How the levels connect is random each time you play the game. [CR]The goal of the game is to locate a key which is necessary to access the warp which leads to the eight and final level. Collect it from whichever level it is hidden inside of, and access the eighth level before any of your competitors.</plot>

				<plot>Shanghai is one of the first video game adaptations of the tile-based game played with the Chinese mahjong stones - essentially a puzzle game that has little to do with real mahjong rules.The gameplay involves 144 tiles, each depicting different images, which have to be removed by matching them into pairs. The tiles are arranged in a gridded pattern, which is higher near the centre. A tile can only be removed if it has no tile next to it on at least one side.This computer implementation can generate a random board layout to take on and features five preset challenges, some of which have time limits of five or ten minutes, as well as a multiplayer mode.</plot>

				<plot>After the defeat of the evil wizard Mondain and his mistress Minax in the previous two Ultimas, peace has returned to the land of Sorsaria. Times passes and eventually geological disruptions and a resurgence of the monster populace occur, and it is soon learned that Mondain and Minax had conceived a child named Exodus before their death. Now that child has become an adult with the power to avenge the death of his parents. Obviously, it falls upon the hero from Earth to find and stop him.[CR]The third title in the Ultima series was the first to feature a party of adventurers instead of a single player character. The party is created at the beginning of the game by assigning various class combinations and determining the characters' attributes. The game has larger and more detailed towns, populated by NPCs the protagonist can converse with to obtain clues. Like in earlier Ultima games, exploration is divided between top-down overworld locations and first-person 3D dungeons. This installment introduces separate combat screens where player-controlled party fights multiple monsters in a turn-based tile-based system.</plot>

				<plot>The Mad Overlord Trebor was once only power-mad, but went off the deep end after he acquired a magical amulet of immense power, only to have it stolen from him by his nemesis, the evil archmage Werdna. Werdna, not quite sure how to use the amulet properly, accidentally causes an earthquake which creates a ten-level dungeon beneath Trebor's castle. To avoid looking silly, Werdna declares the dungeon to be the new lair for him and his monster hordes. Trebor, not to be outdone, declares the labyrinth his new Proving Grounds where adventurers must prove themselves for membership in his elite honor guard, and incidentally retrieve his amulet in the process.The first Wizardry was one of the original dungeon-crawling role-playing games, and stands along with  Ultima and  Might &amp; Magic as one of the defining staples of the genre.The player generates and control a party of up to six different adventurers, choosing from four races (humans, elves, dwarves, gnomes and hobbits), three alignments (good, neutral and evil), and four basic classes (fighter, priest, mage and thief). These can later evolve into elite classes (bishop: priest with mage spells; samurai: fighter with mage spells; lord: fighter with priest spells, and ninja: fighter with thief abilities) if they meet the necessary level requirements. After outfitting the party with basic weapons and armor, the player sends it into a 3D vector maze-like dungeon to fight monsters in turn-based combat and find treasure.</plot>

The Recon mode is a port of the arcade game Xevious; the Scramble mode can be considered its sequel, adding sixteen new stages, enemies, and boss battles, as the brave fighter pilots continue to defend the Earth against its former inhabitants, who migrated to the planet Xevious thousands of years ago and are now determined to re-capture their ancestral homeland.[CR]The game's Scramble mode allows the player to control three other aircrafts in addition to the seris' trademark Solvalou, each possessing unique weapons. These aircrafts include Solgrado (armed with spread shot), Zeodalley (twin back fire), and Gampmission, a large ship that is also a combination of the previous three, with massive firepower and enhanced lock-on abilities. A specific aircraft can be assigned to each of the player's "lives". The amount of points needed to gather an extra life increases if the player selects more powerful ships. Also, enemies become progressively harder as the controlled aircraft collects power-ups.</plot>

				<title_clean>Yamamura Misa Suspense - Kyoto Ryuu no Tera Satsujinjiken</title_clean>
				<plot>This is a shooting game with a twist. You are in control of a small character who has to go through a serious of stages. Each stage consists of one screen only and contains several energy packs hidden behind various obstacles. Your goal is to eat up all the energy packs at a given stage, or (which is sometimes easier, but with dire consequences to the later stages) destroy them. If you manage to eat the energy packs, you'll gain more energy points, which carry over to the next stage. You'll need the energy points because every shot from your gun costs you one, and each collision with the various enemies flying around can deplete a large bulk of them. The twist of the game is in the movement: instead of simply flying around, you must shoot into the direction opposite of the desired movement. For example, if you shoot several times to the left, you'll be thrown to the right. Everything is built around the reactive force of your gun and the gravity force, which will slowly make you descend onto the ground if you don't shoot continuously.
